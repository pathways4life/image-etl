As shown in Table 2, RsbR, YkoB, YojH, YqhA, and the fused YetI-YezB proteins interacted with each other and with the environmental signaling antagonist protein RsbS when paired in the yeast two-hybrid system. In contrast, YtvA interacted only with RsbR and YqhA. None of the newly characterized RsbR paralogs interacted with the downstream RsbT or RsbU regulator from the environmental signaling pathway, with RsbV or RsbW from the common part of the ςB regulatory pathway, or with SpoIIAA or SpoIIAB from the ςF regulatory pathway.</div></div>
