A cAMP signaling pathway consisting of G protein Î± subunits (GNA1 and GNA2), adenylyl cyclase (CR1), and a PKA regulatory subunit (MCB) is involved in conidiation, morphogenesis, mating, and stress tolerance. Ras-, MAP kinase (MAPK)-, and PKA-related kinase-mediated signaling pathways also regulate conidiation. How signaling is coordinated between these pathways remains to be elucidated.</div></div>
