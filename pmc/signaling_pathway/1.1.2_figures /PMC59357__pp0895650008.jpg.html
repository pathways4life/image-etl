The PR genes (PR-1, PR-4, and GluB) utilize two signaling pathways: a SA-dependent and an ethylene-dependent pathway. PR-1 and GluB utilize a third pathway, a systemin-independent, JA-dependent pathway, which may be analogous to the SA-independent pathway used to induce defensins in Arabidopsis (Penninckx et al., 1995). The fourth signaling pathway is the octadecanoid pathway, which in tomato utilizes systemin, ABA, JA, and ethylene to activate the wound-response genes (LapA1, LapA2, and pin2) and SA to down-regulate the pathway. There is evidence for a fifth signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. A JA-independent mechanism for wound-response gene activation was recently described, but tomato genes activated by this pathway have yet to be identified (Titarenko et al., 1997).</div></div>
