The apoptosis-triggering protein(s) attaches to the host cell surface and then stimulates the death receptors through unknown systems. Stimulation of the death receptors induces apoptosis through sequential induction of caspase-8 activity, proapoptotic proteins Bad and Bid, caspase-9 activity, and caspase-3 activity. Under the serum-supplemented condition, expression of antiapoptotic factors of H. pylori would presumably increase, leading to activation of antiapoptotic pathways of the host cell. Antiapoptotic substances, such as growth factors, would also be responsible for inhibition of H. pylori-mediated apoptosis.</div></div>
