From: Transformation by v-Src: Ras-MAPK and PI3K-mTOR Mediate Parallel Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Signaling pathways required for transformation by v-Src. v-Src activates both the Ras-MAPK pathway, which can be inhibited by coexpression of N17Ras or by PD98059, and, in parallel, the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, which can be inhibited by LY294002 or rapamycin. Inhibition of both pathways is required to block transformation. Our data do not exclude the possibility that Src, Ras, and PI3K activate other pathways that are also necessary for transformation.</div></div>
