As described in the background, the Wnt signaling pathway is conserved in evolution and has an intricate role in cancer. When Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled receptors, a signaling cascade is triggered where the β-catenin protein becomes stabilized and can enter the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes through binding target HMG-box proteins. Lef/TCF proteins directly bind the DNA, and when bound to β-catenin activate transcription of target genes such as cyclin D1 and c-myc (reviewed in Bienz and Clevers, 2000; Polakis, 2000). In normal tissues, the tumor suppressor protein, APC, along with a complex containing axin and GSK-3β, triggers the degradation of β-catenin when Wnt signaling is turned off. All three components are important for preventing accumulation of β-catenin; loss-of-function mutations in APC and axin are associated with colorectal and hepatocellular cancers. In addition, stabilizing mutations in β-catenin have been identified in many human cancers. With the literature of the Wnt pathway as a backdrop, the work in this paper supports a model in which HBP1 is a suppressor of Wnt signaling and is a negative regulator of proliferation in normal tissues. HBP1 can block Wnt signaling from four points in the pathway: Wnt itself, GSK3β inhibition, β-catenin and LEF/TCF. The endogenous cyclin D1 and c-myc target genes are also inhibited by HBP1 expression in a cell with a constitutive Wnt signaling pathway. Our data indicate that the probable mechanism is the inhibition of DNA binding by LEF and TCF through a physical interaction with HBP1. The same regions of HBP1 that are necessary for suppression of Wnt signaling are also required for growth inhibition in cells with a constitutive Wnt pathway. Thus, HBP1 may have a role in tumor suppression by inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway.</div></div>
