Shown is a simplified diagram of the  endocytic pathway. Listed below is the time period during which the  EGFR traverses the different compartments after EGF addition as  determined by colocalization studies. The association of different  substrates with the EGFR is based on results from both 184A1 and HB2  cells.</div></div>
