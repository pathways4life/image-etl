Broken arrows indicate that direct interactions between components have not been demonstrated. See text for details. Not depicted in the figure are Bmh1 and Bmh2, the yeast homologues of 14-3-3 proteins, which have been shown recently to be involved in TOR signaling (Bertram et al., 1998).</div></div>
