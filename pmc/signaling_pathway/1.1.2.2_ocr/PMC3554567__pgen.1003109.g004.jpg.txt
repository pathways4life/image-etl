Migration Rate Migration Rate

 

Nodal signaling through FoxH1 increases myocardial
migration rates on the left

Bmp signaling to the endocardium non-autonomously
decreases myocardial migration rates on the right and
potentially tempers Nodal-induced increases in velocity
on the left

Nodal signaling on the left indirectly limits Bmp pathway
activation, likely through competition for Smad4

FoxH1 is required for cardiac cell responsiveness to Bmp
signals and endocardial activation of the Bmp pathway
