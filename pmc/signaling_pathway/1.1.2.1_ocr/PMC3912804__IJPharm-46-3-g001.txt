Primary Cilium PTCH-1 SMO GLI-1 Target genes OFF Nucleus In the absence or Hh ligand. PTCH positioned on the cell membrane at the base of primary cilia, inhibits (red bar) the SMO from entering the cilium, thereby preventing the initintion of downstream signaling events. GLI I activator proteins along with SUFU which is u negative su ppressor, prevents the transcription ofGLJ I target genes thereby keeping the pathway off.
