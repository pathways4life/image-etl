PTCH-1 ON * Inactivating Mutation SMO *Activating Mutation Type 1-Ligand-independent cancers encompass an inactivating mutation (Blue asterisk) of PTCH I or activming mutations (Red a_~terisk) of SMO so that it can no longer be inhibited by I'TCH I. This leads to autonomous activation ofhedgehog signaling pathway even in absence oft he ligand.
