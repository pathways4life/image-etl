VECs were pretreated with various concentrations of Pae for 24 h before being incubated with HG (final concentration of 35.5 mM) for another 48 h. Then VSMCs were inoculated into the top of the Transwell plate and cocultured with VECs for another 24 h. Protein concentrations were analyzed by Western blot. ##P &lt; 0.01 versus NG (5.5 mM) coculture group; *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01 versus HG (35.5 mM) coculture group.</div></div>
