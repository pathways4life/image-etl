LIF causes heterodimerization of LIFR and gp130. LIF causes phosphorylation and activation of JAK, which is tethered to the intracellular region of gp130. Activated JAK phosphorylates gp130 and its tyrosine phosphorylations causes interaction with STAT3. Then STAT3 is also tyrosine-phosphorylated by JAK and is homodimerized via its SH2 domains. The dimerized STAT3 translocates to the nucleus and activates target gene transcription. JAK-STAT3 activates Klf4, which maintains Oct3/4 expression via Nanog. JAK activates PI3K, which acts as an activator for AKT. AKT then upregulates Tbx3 as another pluripotency gene. The JAK-STAT pathway is negatively regulated by several inhibitory systems: dephosphorylation by tyrosine phosphatases including SHP and physical inhibition or ubiquitin-mediated degradation of JAK by SOCS. JAK phosphorylates SHP and then SHP interacts with the Grb2/SOS complex to activate the MAPK pathway, leading to inhibition of Tbx3 and Nanog. TRIM8 likely negatively regulates Hsp90Î²-mediated translocation of STAT3 into the nucleus of ESCs. SLIM is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates the JAK-STAT signal pathway, but SLIM is expressed at a low level in mouse ESCs. P, phosphorylation.</div></div>
