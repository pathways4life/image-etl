The proposed pathway reflects SILAC data, PathwayAssistâ„¢ data, and interactions and protein functions found in the primary literature. Proteins in white ovals indicate previously established EphB2 interactions. Arrows indicate positive regulation or activation and blunt ended lines indicate inhibition. Proteins in boxes (Rac, Ras, and Erk) indicate known effectors not found in our experiments.</div></div>
