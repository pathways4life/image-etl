From: Molecular Mechanisms involved in Farnesol-Induced Apoptosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by farnesol is related to ER stress. Upon activation of the UPR, activated IRE1α binds TRAF2 and recruits IKK, which subsequently phosphorylates IκB thereby promoting its degradation, while activation of the PERK-eIF2α pathway leads to attenuation of the rate of mRNA translation, including a reduction in IκBα synthesis. These events act synergistally to reduce IκBα and lead to the exposure of the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB, its translocation to the nucleus, and activation of NF-κB target genes. Activation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-MSK1 pathway by farnesol promotes the phosphorylation of p65/relA (Ser276) thereby enhancing NF-κB transcriptional activity.</div></div>
