WNK1 and WNK4 were shown to phosphorylate SPAK/OSR1 and subsequently phosphorylate NCC to activate NCC, whereas our present data also showed that WNK4 also phosphorylates ERK1/2 and subsequently decreases NCC protein expression, suggesting that WNK4-ERK1/2 signaling pathway is inhibitory in NCC regulation. Aldo, aldosterone; SGK1, serum glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1; WNK4 PHA II mutant indicates either E562K or R1185C; ERK1/2 is one component of MAPK signaling pathway. Gray black lines indicate the known stimulatory signaling pathways. Thick black lines indicate the novel inhibitory signaling pathway. + Sign indicates a stimulatory effect and âˆ’ sign indicates an inhibitory effect.</div></div>
