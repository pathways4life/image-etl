Wnt/β-catenin signaling directly regulates osteoblast transcription factors, including Runx2 and probably ATF4. The reduced Wnt/β-catenin signaling and reduction of Dkk2 mRNA expression (important for terminal osteoblast differentiation) probably contribute to decreased osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in Fgf2−/− mice. However, exogenous FGF2 promoted β-catenin nuclear accumulation and induced inhibited kinase GSK3β, which could increase Wnt signaling in Fgf2−/− BMSCs and probably contributes to rescue the decreased osteoblast differentiation in Fgf2−/− BMSCs.
