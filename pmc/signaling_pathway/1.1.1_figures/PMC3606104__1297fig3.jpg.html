From: Genetic Networks Inducing Invasive Growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Identified Through Systematic Genome-Wide Overexpression. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Identification of genetic networks that regulate the induction of filamentous growth. (A) The overexpression screen data set was analyzed for enrichment of pathways annotated in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Enriched pathways are shown (cell cycle sce04111, meiosis sce04113, and MAPK signaling sce04011) along with genes identified in the screen that are annotated as belonging to the respective pathway. (B) Network connectivity map was built for the MAPK signaling, meiosis, and cell cycle networks from interactions annotated in KEGG. In-house programs were used to parse the pathway maps into nodes and edges for visualization using Cytoscape. The numbered circles indicate a subset of the genes identified in the overexpression screen that belong to the respective networks. Blowups of central portions of the cell cycle, meiosis, and MAPK signaling networks are provided, with key network components indicated in larger circles. Components of a given pathway in the map are indicated with a dashed line to highlight the overlap between networks. Two key connections between the MAPK signaling modules and the cell cycle/meiosis networks involving the Kss1p and Hog1p signaling cascades are shown in blue within the inset box.</div></div>
