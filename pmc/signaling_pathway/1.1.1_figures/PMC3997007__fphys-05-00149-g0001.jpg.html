(A)</b> Cell-autonomous model. In the proliferating cell, a non-apoptotic caspase signaling pathway leads to a change in cell behavior through modulation of gene expression, cytoskeletal restructuring, or other means. This signaling is endogenous to the proliferating cell itself, and no apoptotic cell signaling is involved. <b>(B)</b> Non-cell-autonomous model. In this model, caspase activity within apoptotic cells lead to the generation of signaling factors which stimulate the cell behavior change of nearby cells in a paracrine fashion.</div></div>
