A proposed scheme for O2-signaling via the Skp1 modification enzymes, Skp1 (as a subunit of E3(SCF)Ub-ligases), a hypothetical activator, and protein kinase A (PKA). See text for explanation. The dependent sequence of posttranslational modifications are shown vertically at the left, and the dependent sequence of developmental transitions is shown vertically on the right. Speculative aspects of the model, such as regulation of glycosyltransferases by Fuc and Gal (at the left), are denoted in pink. High O2 can override the pathway, as shown at the right.</div></div>
