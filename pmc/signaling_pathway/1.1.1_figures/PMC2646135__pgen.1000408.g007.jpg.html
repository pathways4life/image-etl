Each of these pathways regulates mitochondrial functions. In the present study, we underlined the importance of Git3/PKA dependent signaling in longevity versus the glucose repression pathway and the metabolic effect of glycolysis. Git3/PKA signal inhibits mitochondrial respiration, oxidative stress response and promotes ROS formation and pro-aging phenotypes. Discontinuous line represents functions inferred by homology with S. cerevisiae. Question mark represents the possible role of mitochondria in aging besides ROS production.</div></div>
