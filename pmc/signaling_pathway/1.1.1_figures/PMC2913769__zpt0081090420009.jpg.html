Pathway A was characterized previously (Hartz et al., 2010). Pathway B is described in the present study. We speculate that the two pathways are linked in that transporter internalization must precede proteasomal degradation. It remains to be determined whether PTEN/PI3K/Akt/GSK3 signaling directs internalized BCRP to the proteasome or whether it stimulates ubiquitination and processing of the protein.</div></div>
