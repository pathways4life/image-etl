TNFα signaling leads to activation of NF-κB and the anti-apoptotic protein XIAP. Other receptors that detect survival factors, such as growth factors and cytokines, induce ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling cascades that ultimately result in the inhibition of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bad. In contrast, upon removal of survival factors, these receptors can signal via JNK to induce the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax. Pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins govern the intrinsic pathway of cell death, which results in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and induction of the caspase cascade. Signaling through death receptors initiate the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, leading to the induction of caspases and cell death. There are numerous miRNAs that regulate each of these pathways and dysregulation of these miRNAs can lead to anti-apoptotic and tumorigenic responses.</div></div>
