From: De-Regulated MicroRNAs in Pediatric Cancer Stem Cells Target Pathways Involved in Cell Proliferation, Cell Cycle and Development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A). The p53 pathway that includes 8 signaling components as defined by KEGG was highly regulated by the CSC associated DEmiRs. Five of the 26 DEmiRs were implicated in this pathway, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-135b, hsa-miR-29, hsa-miR-655, hsa-miR-494. TGF-beta pathway of KEGG (B). The TGF-beta pathway was also regulated by the CSC associated DEmiRs. Receptor TGFBR1 was regulated by hsa-miR-101-3p, and receptor TGFBR2 was regulated by hsa-miR-21-5p, and hsa-miR-519a-3p. The receptor BMPR2 was regulated by hsa-miR-101-3p, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-181c-5p, and hsa-miR-494. Nodal type II receptor kinase and receptor ACVR2B were also regulated by hsa-miR-101-3p.</div></div>
