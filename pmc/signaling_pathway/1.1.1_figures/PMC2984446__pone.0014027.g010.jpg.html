Model indicating a biphasic response of the homologous recombination <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> induced by the alkylating agent MMS..  From: PI 3 Kinase Related Kinases-Independent Proteolysis of BRCA1 Regulates Rad51 Recruitment during Genotoxic Stress in Human Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In response to MMS, human cells induce a signaling pathway that culminates in BRCA1/BARD1 downregulation. This prevents the unwanted assembly of the HR machinery at the early stage of the MMS-induced DNA damage response. At the second stage, recovery and assembly of HR proteins ensure the repair of DSBs generated by replication blocks.</div></div>
