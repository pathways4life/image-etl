Tgfbr2 was recently identified and validated as an obesity susceptibility gene. <b>B </b>The genes comprising the TGF-β signaling pathway are correlated with hundreds of other genes in the liver network (Schadt et al. 2005) so that components of this pathway affect and are affected by many different parts of the network</div></div>
