This simplified figure depicts signaling molecules activated following chemokine receptor activation. The binding of chemokines to their respective receptors results in the activation of three main downstream signaling pathways to various cellular responses. The classical G-protein pathway activates various downstream systems including PLC, PI3K, FAK and MAPK, leading to cell adhesion, polarization and chemotaxis. Inactivating Giα using PTX can be inhibite this pathway. The activation of the JAK/STAT pathway being initiated following the tyrosine phosphorylation of activated chemokine receptors has been documented. The signaling pathways initiated by phosphorylation at serine/threonine residues on the COOH-terminus region involve the activities of GRKs and β-arrestins. This pathway is responsible for internalization and recycling/degradation of the activated receptors. Arrows indicate “activated downstream”. Question marks indicate unclear downstream signaling pathways. FAK focal adhesion kinase, PLC phospholipase C, PI3K phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase, PTX pertussis toxin, JAK/STAT Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription, GRKs G-protein-coupled receptor kinases.</div></div>
