Indicated are classical components of the p53-mediated cell-cycle arrest pathway: Mdm2, Mdm4 and the p53-effector p21waf1; essential components of the metabolic fuel-sensing pathway: AMPK and mTORC; and the recently positioned sestrins, as discussed in the text.mTORC: Mammalian target of rapamycin complex.</div></div>
