From: Bcl-2 is the target of a UV-inducible apoptosis switch and a node for UV <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">UVB acts at both the switch and the switched pathway to trigger UV-induced apoptosis. DNA photoproducts trigger phosphorylation of P53 and Mdm2, thereby reducing P53 degradation. In many systems, the elevated P53 triggers apoptosis by transcriptionally activating Bax, Bak, Puma, PIGs, and Noxa, as well as acting directly at mitochondria. For UVB-induced apoptosis, however, a larger signal proceeds through a pathway in which UV-induced P53 inactivates E2f1, as described in the text. Graded doses of UV cause the P53–E2f1 regulatory apparatus to transition from a fully OFF p53−/−-like state to a fully ON E2f1−/−-like state. The apoptosis-inhibitory activity of E2f1 acts through Bcl-2, which suppresses the information flow in a direct pathway that is triggered by UV even when the P53–E2f1 regulatory apparatus is removed. P53 disinhibits this pathway. Two secondary signaling pathways (dotted lines) are appreciable when basal Bcl-2 is low, as described in the text.</div></div>
