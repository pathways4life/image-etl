Gene ontology analysis was carried out using DAVID on the set of differentially expressed genes. B. qRT-PCR was performed on some of the important players in the Wnt pathway to verify these gene expression changes. The left two bars show expression changes on array, and the right bar shows expression changes as measured by qPCR. qPCR was performed by comparing the second GRN hairpin versus the scrambled hairpin. C. KEGG Pathway for Wnt Signaling, with differentially expressed genes during GRNi (p&lt;0.05) circled. Upregulated genes are colored red and downregulated genes are colored green.
