There are two major apoptotic signaling pathways: the extrinsic pathway and the mitochondria (intrinsic) pathway. In addition, there is another pathway that involves T-cell mediated cytotoxicity and perforin-granzyme-dependent killing of the cell. The mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway is regulated by Bcl-2 family and activated by mitochondrial disruption with subsequent cytochrome c release. Initiators of this pathway include UV irradiation and cytotoxic drugs. An ‘apoptosome’ is formed by the interaction of cytochrome c, Apaf-1, d-ATP/ ATP and procaspase-9 with subsequent initiation of the caspase cascade.</div></div>
