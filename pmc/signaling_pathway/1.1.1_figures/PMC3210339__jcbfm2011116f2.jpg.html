MSC treatment and addition of exogenous rm-Shh increased the tPA level in cultured astrocytes. The Shh signaling pathway inhibitor cyclopamine blocked the tPA increase in astrocytes with MSC coculture and rm-Shh treatment. (<b>C</b>) Western blot shows PAI-1 protein level in cultured astrocytes. MSC treatment and addition of exogenous rm-Shh decreased PAI-1 expression in cultured astrocytes. The Shh signaling pathway inhibitor cyclopamine increased PAI-1 expression in astrocytes with MSC coculture and rm-Shh treatment. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, compared with normal astrocytes; ^P&lt;0.05, ^^P&lt;0.01 compared with OGD astrocytes; #P&lt;0.05, ##P&lt;0.01, compared with MSC treatment; ++P&lt;0.01, compared with rm-Shh treatment.
