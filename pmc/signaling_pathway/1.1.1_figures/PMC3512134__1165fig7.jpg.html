Pathways similar to the MEN and the RAM network are broadly conserved in eukaryotes. Activating phosphorylations are shown as green arrows, while inhibitory phosphorylation is shown as a red block arrow. The MEN is most similar to the pathway in the left box, although no sav ortholog is present. The RAM is most similar to the pathway in the right box.</div></div>
