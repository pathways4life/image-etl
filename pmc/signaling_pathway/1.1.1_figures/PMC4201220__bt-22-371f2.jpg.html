(A) Without signaling (absence of ligand), negative regulators (CKIα, GSK3β, Axin, and APC) phosphorylate β-catenin, and then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. (B) With signaling (presence of ligand), stabilized β-catenin in cytoplasm is translocated into nucleus and activate the expression of target genes. (C) Genetic pathway for control DTC fate specification (see text for explanation). (D) Wild-type hermaphrodite has two DTCs. lag-2::GFP reporter is strongly expressed in DTCs (see green). (E) Loss of Wnt/β-catenin signaling affects DTC fate specification. (F) Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling contributes to extra DTC formation. (G) Strategy for the phenotype-based identification of drugs that either inhibit or activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling using C. elegans mutants.</div></div>
