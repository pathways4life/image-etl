From: Amino acids as regulators of gene expression. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway. The mTOR signaling pathway is controlled through various upstream kinases (e.g. AMPK, AKT, and MK2) that converge on the tuberous sclerosis complex, TSC1•TSC2. TSC2 is a GTPase-activator protein for Rheb which is a positive effector of signaling through mTOR. mTOR signals to downstream targets such as 4E-BP1 and S6K1 as a complex with the regulatory proteins raptor and GβL as described in detail in the text.</div></div>
