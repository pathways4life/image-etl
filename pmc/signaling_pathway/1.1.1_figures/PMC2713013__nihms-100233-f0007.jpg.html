Unchecked IL-1 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> causes inflammation and autoimmunity in Ptpn6spin mice.  From: MICROBE SENSING, POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS, AND THE PATHOGENESIS OF INFLAMMATORY DISEASES. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) The IL-1 signaling loop is initiated by microbial stimulation of TLRs, which through canonical TLR signaling via IRAK1, IRAK4, TRAF6, IKK complex, and NF-κB activation, leads to IL-1β production. IL-1β activates its own receptor, which also signals via the same TLR pathway components to produce IL-1β. Through an unknown mechanism, impaired SHP1 function in Ptpn6spin cells results in a failure to downregulate IL-1 signaling, which continues to stimulate its own production. This uninhibited IL-1 signaling loop (B) ultimately causes chronic inflammation and autoimmunity in Ptpn6spin mice. Derivation into a germfree environment and inactivating mutations in MyD88, IRAK4, and IL-1R suppress disease in Ptpn6spin mutants.</div></div>
