Starvation effects on insulin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> components and JH synthesis in the CA of mosquitoes..  From: Starvation Increases Insulin Sensitivity and Reduces Juvenile Hormone Synthesis in Mosquitoes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">This scheme summarizes starvation-related changes of insulin/TOR pathway components and JH synthesis. Molecules in red color are down-regulated (↓), while those in green are upregulated (↑). Previous experiments established the involvement of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and TOR in the transduction of insulin signaling in the CA [13]. Astarvation-dependent decrease of insulin results in an increase of FOXO signaling that promotes activation of transcription of insulin receptor (INSr) and 4E-binding protein (4EBP). Transcripts levels for FOXO increase and mRNAs for JHAMT and TOR decrease. JH synthesis decrease, while increases of 4EBP inhibit translation and increases of INSr enhance insulin sensitivity.</div></div>
