(<b>B</b>) Upon insulin (I)  binding to its receptor (IR), active PI3K catalyzes the phosphorylation of the  plasma-membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate  [PtdIns(4,5)P2; PIP2] to  PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3), driving the translocation of OGT  from the nucleus to the plasma membrane by its binding to  PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. OGT is then tyrosine phosphorylated by  active IR. This occurs simultaneously with the activation of other molecules  of the pathway such as phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), IRS-1 and  Akt, which is mediated in part by phosphorylation events. (<b>C</b>) Active  OGT can now O-GlcNAcylate substrates of the pathway, including IR,  IRS-1, Akt and OGT itself. O-GlcNAcylation of IRS-1 occurs in  parallel with its phosphorylation at several serine residues that are known to  inactivate IRS-1. Comparatively, O-GlcNAcylation of Akt inhibits its  (activating) phosphorylation at a threonine residue, thereby inhibiting its  kinase activity. Thus, the overall effect of O-GlcNAcylation of  insulin signaling molecules leads to attenuation of the pathway.</div></div>
