Activation of PKCε results in activation of TRAM-TRIF, which is responsible for late-phase TNFα and type I interferon (i.e., IFN-α/β) expression. Concurrently, IL-32γ binds to PR3 and activates PAR2. PAR2-Ras and -TRIF pathways potentially induce TNFα expression, and the latter pathway in particular induces type I interferon expression via IRF3/7. At that time, TAG is synthesized to terminate TLR4-TRIF signaling, with TRIF preferentially recruited to PAR2 instead. Following LPS-induced TNFα expression mainly through TLR4, LPS-induced IL-32γ-PAR2 signaling gradually increases type I interferon expression, which potentially translates innate to adaptive immunity, or ceases a series of LPS-induced acute inflammation.</div></div>
