Upregulated genes are shown in red and downregulated genes are shown in blue. The expected effect of overexpression of genes on Smad signaling is shown by arrowed lines (stimulation) or blunt lines (inhibition). The expected effect of downregulation of Hoxc8 is release of inhibition, and thus activation of signaling (dotted blunt line). BMP, bone morphogenetic proteins. The figure is a modification from the original in Gerhardinger et al.3 </div></div>
