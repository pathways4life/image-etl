From: Role of the TWEAK-Fn14-cIAP1-NF-?B <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Axis in the Regulation of Myogenesis and Muscle Homeostasis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Differential activation of NF-κB pathways by TWEAK based on strength of Fn14 signaling</b>. TWEAK can signal either in a juxtacrine manner, as a membrane-bound ligand, mTWEAK <b>(A)</b>, or in a paracrine manner as a soluble ligand, sTWEAK <b>(B,C)</b>. Depending on the concentration of ligand or receptor, or the propensity of the Fn14 ligand to oligomerize the receptor and form signaling clusters, differential activation of the NF-κB pathways occurs. <b>(A)</b> During juxtacrine signaling, mTWEAK favors the clustering of Fn14 on the opposite cell, leading to hyperactive signaling for which canonical NF-κB signaling predominates over non-canonical signaling. MAPK activation also occurs. <b>(B)</b> Under physiological conditions, low endogenous levels of sTWEAK signal in a paracrine manner, leading predominantly to non-canonical NF-κB activation. <b>(C)</b> However, under certain pathological or experimental conditions, sTWEAK can also lead to hyperactive signaling leading to canonical NF-κB and MAPK signaling. For example, high concentrations of TWEAK, applied to myoblasts or myotubes ex vivo, hinder differentiation and cause atrophy, respectively. Transgenic over-expression of TWEAK in mice also leads to pathological consequences. In a variety of injury states (such as denervation-induced muscle atrophy), the receptor Fn14 is induced, which then is followed by and pathological responses to endogenous levels of TWEAK. Furthermore, recombinant TWEAK fusion proteins with the ability to multimerize, or Fn14 agonistic antibodies, can both promote receptor clustering and the activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway. The pathways leading to pathological activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway are still poorly defined, but are thought to arise either from pathway cross-talk, such as that seen with NIK or IKK activation of the canonical mediators, or through the adaptor and E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. In addition, activation of MAPK pathways may also contribute to the pathology observed.</div></div>
