Toll and IMD immune <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways involved in anti-Plasmodium defense.  From: Mosquito immune defenses against Plasmodium infection. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Following recognition of a microbe, or unknown Plasmodium ligand, by soluble PGRP molecules, the Toll pathway is stimulated by binding of the ligand Sp√§tzle with the Toll transmembrane receptor. This triggers a series of molecular events that culminate in the activation (*) and translocation of Rel1 into the nucleus, up-regulating transcription of immune genes that are responsible for microbial killing. The IMD pathway is stimulated when the transmembrane PGRPLC receptor binds peptidoglycan or an unknown Plasmodium ligand that leads to the cleavage of Rel2-F and translocation of active Rel2-S (*) into the nucleus. A different set of anti-Plasmodium genes are up-regulated when the IMD pathway is stimulated. Branching of the IMD pathway is indicated, but the JNK pathway has not been extensively characterized in Anopheles mosquitoes.</div></div>
