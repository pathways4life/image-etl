A) Pathway alteration in each sample is indicated by a black box. Sample IDs are shown at the top and pathway names at the left. Selected clinical variables and clusters from Fig. 3 are indicated with colored boxes. B) Notch pathway. C) Mitogenic signaling pathway. D) Cell cycle pathway. E) TP53 pathway. Pathway diagrams indicate the genes included in each pathway. Copy gains are indicated with red, copy losses with blue, mutations with black and methylation with purple. Percentages shown indicate the frequency of that event.</div></div>
