Oligomers as Mediators of Neuronal Damage in Alzheimer's Disease. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Postsynaptic receptors for Aβ oligomers affect different signaling pathways</b>. The scheme shows that the binding of Aβ oligomers to different postsynaptic receptors might trigger synaptotoxicity and consequent neuronal death by activating different signaling pathways, as indicated, only in the case of NL-1 (neuroligin-1) and the PrPc (cellular prion protein), the precise pathway is not known. p75 (p75 receptor of neurotrophin), α7-nAChR (α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor), NMDAR (N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor), and mGluR (metabotropic glutamate receptors), the signaling pathway is already known. In the case of the α7-nAChR, recent studies from our laboratory also implicated the Wnt signaling pathway.</div></div>
