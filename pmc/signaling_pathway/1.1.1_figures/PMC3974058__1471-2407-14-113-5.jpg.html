(A, B, C)</b> MEF were incubated for 48 hrs with TGFβ 3 ng/ml and the ALK-inhibitor SB431542 1 μM either singly or in combination. Controls included carriers for SB431542 (DMSO) or for TGFβ (0.1% BSA). <b>(A)</b> Western blots and <b>(B)</b> immunofluorescence were used to detect expression of CD248 (green). <b>(C)</b> CD248 mRNA levels were also quantified (n = 3 experiments, each in triplicate; *p &lt; 0.05). Results indicate that TGFβ-mediated suppression of CD248 protein and mRNA requires integrity of canonical ALK5-Smad2 signaling pathway. Scale bar = 50 μm.</div></div>
