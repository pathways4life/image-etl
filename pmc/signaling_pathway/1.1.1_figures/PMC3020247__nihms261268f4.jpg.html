All genes involved in the TLR signaling pathway were evaluated by GeneSifter using Z-score as a parameter. Pn6A vs. PBS control had Z-scores (2.41 for up-regulated genes and −1.85 for down-regulated genes) of TLR signaling pathway (A, black bar, up-regulated; gray bar, down-regulated). Similar changes were observed in the MAPK signaling pathway. Dotted line in A indicates a normal range for Z-scores (A). Microarray heat maps demonstrated that the TLR signaling pathway genes and related genes were up-regulated (IL-1β, IL-6, MIP-1α, TLR4, TLR2, p38MAPK, jun, IκBα) or down-regulated (MAPK14 and PI3 K p85β) (B) in the rat middle ear mucosa after Pn6A challenge for 3–14 d. Upward and downward rows indicate up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively.</div></div>
