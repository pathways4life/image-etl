In the posterior daughter, activation of the Wnt pathway leads to formation of a POP-1/SYS-1 complex that promotes expression of target genes required for the seam cell fate. In the anterior daughter, POP-1 interacts with transcriptional repressors to keep these Wnt pathway targets off. The curvy line at the membrane indicates expression of Wnt receptor. A) An anterior-posterior gradient of Wnt ligands (higher in the posterior) leads to asymmetric activation of the pathway in the posterior daughter. B) The asymmetric localization of Wnt pathway components (such as the receptor, shown here) to the posterior cell allows only that daughter to respond to a permissive Wnt signal in the environment. Alternatively, the asymmetric distribution of a negative pathway regulator (shown by a triangle) to the anterior daughter could keep the pathway off in that cell, even in the presence of permissive Wnt signal and appropriate receptor. C) Asymmetric localization of some Wnt pathway components to the posterior daughter (such as the receptor) and other factors to the anterior daughter, leads to activation of the pathway in the posterior daughter in a Wnt-independent manner. For example, a non-Wnt ligand localized to the anterior daughter (shown by a star) could activate the Wnt receptor in the posterior daughter.</div></div>
