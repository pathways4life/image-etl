From:  Mechano-Regulation of Alternative Splicing. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Phosphorylation signaling pathway of alternative splicing regulated by mechanical stress.</b> In response to mechanical stimulation, Ca2+ influx is induced by Ca2+ channel. The pathways of CaMKII-TAK1-SAPKs and NF-ÎºB-IL-6 and PKC are activated by Ca2+ influx, then regulate the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. Integrins which are sensitive to mechanical stimulation, transmit mechanical signals into cells by ECM and activate FAK/ERK/MAPK path way which regulate alternative splicing directly or under help of RhoA/Rho-ROCK signaling. PI3K is another possible signaling that modulates alternative splicing in cells exposed to mechanical stress.</div></div>
