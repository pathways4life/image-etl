From: Mathematical Models of Specificity in Cell <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The output of four signaling networks exhibiting different degrees of specificity and fidelity. The bars on the graph represent the total output of signaling pathways X and Y (Xout and Yout, respectively) under the condition where pathway X is receiving a signal and pathway Y is not (Xin), and visa versa (Yin). The results correspond to solutions of the network described in Eqs. 5â€“13. All parameter values were set equal to 1 except as specified below. The thickness of the links connecting the component nodes is proportional to the rate coefficient for that reaction (see Fig. 2 A; j is the coefficient for the connection from x1 to y2). (A) This network exhibits both mutual specificity and mutual fidelity. Networks such as this are presumably the most useful to the organism. Rate coefficients are a1 = 2, a2 = 3, b1 = 2, b2 = 2.5, h = 0.5, j = 1. (B) This network displays mutual specificity but not mutual fidelity. Pathway Y does not exhibit fidelity with respect to pathway X, because Y output when Y is on is less than Y output when X is on. Parameter values are a1 = 2, a2 = 3, b1 = 1, b2 = 1.5, h = 0.5, j = 1. (C) This network possesses mutual fidelity, but pathway Y does not exhibit specificity with respect to X. Parameter values are a1 = 2, a2 = 3, b1 = 2, b2 = 1.5, h = 2, j = 1. (D) This network possesses neither mutual specificity nor mutual fidelity. Parameter values are a1 = 2, a2 = 1, b1 = 2, b2 = 1.5, h = 2, j = 3.</div></div>
