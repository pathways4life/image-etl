From: ADAM Proteases: Ligand Processing and Modulation of the Notch <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Different modes of ADAM modulation of the Notch pathway. A, Ligand binding induces Notch cleavage by an ADAM protease at the S2 site, followed by γ-secretase cleavage at the S3/S4 site and release of the NICD from the membrane in a signal-receiving cell. B, Ligand shedding by an ADAM in a signal-sending cell down-regulates Notch signaling in a signal-receiving cell. C, Ligand shedding by an ADAM relieves cis-inhibition of Notch and makes Notch available for interactions with ligands in trans. D, After ADAM cleavage, the transmembrane fragment of the ligand is processed by γ-secretase, and the intracellular domain released from the membrane may act as a signaling molecule.</div></div>
