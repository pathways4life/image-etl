It is also inhibited by statins. FPP synthase converts IPP and DMAPP to GPP and FPP intermediates and is inhibited by aminobisphosphonates and alkylamines. Loss of FPP and GGPP leads to the loss of membrane anchoring of signaling proteins causing signaling defects and, in some cases, apoptosis.</div></div>
