Oxidative stress signaling to Hog1 requires the Ssk1 response regulator (Chauhan et al., 2003), the Ssk2 MAPKKK (this study), and the Pbs2 MAPKK (Arana et al., 2005). However, which histidine kinase(s) regulates Ssk1 in response to oxidative stress is unclear (Li et al., 2004; Roman et al., 2005). Although the relay of osmotic stress signals to Hog1 also requires Ssk2 (this study) and Pbs2 (Arana et al., 2005), Hog1 is activated in response to osmotic stress in ssk1 mutant cells (Chauhan et al., 2003). This, together with the finding that the Sho1â€“Ste11 pathway does not transmit osmotic stress signals to the Pbs2 MAPKK (Roman et al., 2005; this study) indicates the presence of a novel osmotic-stress signaling pathway in C. albicans. Such a pathway may function in parallel with the Ssk1 response regulator to relay osmotic stress signals to Hog1.</div></div>
