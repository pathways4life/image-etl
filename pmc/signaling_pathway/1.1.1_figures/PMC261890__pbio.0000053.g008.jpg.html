Chemical inhibition of signaling molecules, genetic modifications, or induced expression of genes that resulted in elevated RAG expression are summarized in the gray-shaded boxes. The tonic signal and therefore normal expression of RAG genes rely strongly on signaling through the adapter LAT. The effects of basal phosphorylation of LAT are twofold: (1) recruitment and activation of PLCγ generates low levels of second messengers that signal through calcium and Ras pathways, culminating in Erk kinase activity; and (2) phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 6 of LAT, likely establishing a LAT–PLCγ–Abl complex, is required for low-level kinase activity of Abl. Abl and Erk kinase activities deliver unique repressive signals to control RAG gene expression.</div></div>
