Results were normalized to 18 s RNA, n = 3–4/group, *p&lt;0.05 vs. control at the respective time point. C and D) qPCR analysis demonstrates decreased expression of Scap (C) and of Wnt pathway (D) genes in MLE15 cells following transfection with negative control (neg con) and two distinct Scap siRNAs (si1 and si2). Results were normalized to 18 s, n = 6 samples/group representing 3 independent experiments, *p&lt;0.05 vs negative control. ND = non-detectable.</div></div>
