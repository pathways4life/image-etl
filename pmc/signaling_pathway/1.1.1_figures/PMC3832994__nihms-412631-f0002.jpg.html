Localization of total EGF-R (iEGF-R) in non-stimulated cells (a), in cells stimulated with 1000 ng/mL EGF (b) and in cells in which EGF signaling was inhibited by 1 μM Tarceva (c). (d) Levels of iEGF-R are not changed due to activation/inactivation of the EGF pathway. Localization of phosphorylated EGF-R (pEGF-R) in non-stimulated cells (e), in cells stimulated with 1000 ng/mL EGF (f) and in cells in which EGF signaling was inhibited by 1 μM Tarceva (g). (h) Levels of pEGF-R are significantly increased due to activation of the EGF pathway. (i) iEGF-R (green) (i1) accumulates in Transferrin (Tf)-positive vesicles (purple) (i2) in EGF-stimulated cells; merged channels (i3). Insert shows higher magnification of the boxed area and co-localization between iEGF-R and Tf. (j) Co-localization between iEGF-R and Tf-positive vesicles, and between iEGF-R and CT-B-positive vesicles in EGF-stimulated cells. Scale bars, 20 μm. * p &lt; 0.05.</div></div>
