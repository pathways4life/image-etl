From: Genome-wide identification of microRNA targets in human ES cells reveals a role for miR-302 in modulating BMP response. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">miR-302/367 targets modulate TGF-β and BMP signaling. In hESCs, neural induction is initiated by inhibition of TGF-β and BMP signaling. The rapid decline in mir-302 levels upon neural induction suggests that miR-302/367 promotes self-renewal and pluripotency and represses neural differentiation, possibly by suppressing inhibitors of TGF-β and BMP pathways. In this study, we identified three novel miR-302/367 targets that inhibit BMP signaling. Thus, by promoting TGF-β and BMP signaling at the ESC stage through down-regulation of pathway inhibitors, miR-302/367 promotes the pluripotency stage and attenuates neural differentiation.</div></div>
