Group A was significantly associated with MAPK signaling (an intracellular signaling pathway) as well as two pathways associated with extracellular signal transduction: focal adhesion and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. Group B was significantly associated with cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions only. *Bayes Factor &gt;6 (C–D): Results from SPEED analysis for Groups A and B. SPEED analysis revealed a significant overlap in Group A genes with the MAPK gene expression signature, and a significant overlap of Group B genes with the TNF-alpha pathway. *FDR &lt;0.05.</div></div>
