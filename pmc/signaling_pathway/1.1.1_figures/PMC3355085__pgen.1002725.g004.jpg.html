Ack anti-apoptotic function is stimulated by EGF receptor/Ras <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>..  From: Drosophila Activated Cdc42 Kinase Has an Anti-Apoptotic Function. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The Drosophila eye size assay is used to determine how Ack functions with respect to EGF receptor/MAPK signaling. (A) HidAla5 control eye. (B) Overexpression of Ack results in suppression of PCD induced by hidAla5 indicating that Ack suppression of apoptosis is independent of hid phosphorylation by MAPK. (C) Kinase inactive Ack fails to suppress PCD, showing that kinase activity is required for Ack suppression of hidAla5 induced PCD. (D and G) Increased signaling through the MAPK pathway by single copy loss of argos (D) or Gap1 (G) fails to suppress apoptosis due to the inability of MAPK to phosphorylate and inhibit hidAla5. (E and H) Ack overexpression combined with single copy loss of argos (E) or Gap1 (H) further suppresses hidAla5 compared to panel B, showing that Ack can be activated by EGF receptor or Ras signaling. (F and I) AckK156A combined with single copy loss of argos (F) or Gap1 (I) does not suppress hidAla5 PCD. (J) A schematic of the EGF initiated signaling pathway through MAPK is shown. The MAPK pathway regulates hid induced PCD by phosphorylating and inhibiting hid. A hid mutant having five serine/threonine phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine (hidAla5) is unable to be inhibited by the MAPK pathway.</div></div>
