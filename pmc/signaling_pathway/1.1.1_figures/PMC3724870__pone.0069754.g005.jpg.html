We found different signaling cascades for adipogenesis like the (<b>A</b>) insulin signaling pathway, (<b>B</b>) PPARG signaling pathway, (<b>C</b>) fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, (<b>D</b>) adipocytokine signaling pathway, (<b>E</b>) fatty acid elongation pathway, (<b>F</b>) pathway for biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and (<b>G</b>) pathway for fatty acid metabolism.
