WNT signaling leads to a stabilization of β-catenin, the chief downstream effector of the WNT pathway. In the activated state WNT binds to its receptor, Frizzled, which ultimately leads to inactivation of GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) via activation of the DSH (Disheveled). This leads to hypophosphorylation of β-catenin and its release from a complex with APC (adenomatosis polyposis coli) and AXIN, with ensuing nuclear translocation of β-catenin where it binds to the various target genes.</div></div>
