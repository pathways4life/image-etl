Mitochondrial components can induce a DAMP response through the activation of TLR, FPR, RAGE, P2X7, and/or the NALP3 inflammasome. FPR is a GCPR. FPR signaling is mediated through PLC, PIP2, IP3, and DAG. Downstream activation of PKC leads to signaling through MAPK, PI3K, and activation of NFκB and NAPDH oxidase. TLR receptors dimerize with Myd88 and can activate NFκB through RIP1 kinase, MAPK, or PI3K pathways. The TLR pathway also activates NADPH oxidase. RAGE receptor signaling activates PKC and CdC42/Rac (or Ras). Downstream PI3K, MAPK or JNK, and Erk1/2 are activated. This leads to NFκB activation (in addition to SP1 and AP1). P2X7 activation leads to NRLP3 inflammasome signaling. NLRP3 (or IL-1R) activation mediates inflammasome signaling through NLRP3, ACS, and caspase-1 (or RIG-1). Pro-IL-1 is cleaved into IL-1β and IL-1α. NFκB activation initiates transcription of Pro-IL-1, IL-10, IL-18, IL-6, TNFα, along with many other cytokine and chemotactic factors.</div></div>
