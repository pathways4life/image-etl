The protein has 12 predicted transmembrane domains and functions as a phosphate/proton symporter. D178 and D358 are two conserved putative proton-binding residues, predicted to be located adjacent to the phosphate translocation pathway. Mutagenesis of D178 to E or N reduces V max with about 50 %, but does not lower signaling as measured by phosphate-induced activation of the PKA target trehalase. Mutagenesis of D358 to N strongly reduces transport to â‰¤20 % but does not affect signaling. Mutagenesis of D358 to E completely abolishes transport but only causes a 50 % drop in signaling</div></div>
