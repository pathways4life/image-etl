This effect can be abolished by C3G or PDTC. (2) Nuclear translocation of NF-kB via phosphorylation by the IkB kinase, which then binds target DNA that regulates VEGF and MCP-1 gene expression. Ultimately, the changes stimulated by alcohol enhance angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis.</div></div>
