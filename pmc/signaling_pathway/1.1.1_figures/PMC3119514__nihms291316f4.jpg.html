Receptor binding of LTβ, BAFF, CD40, and RANK initiate the non-canonical signaling pathway. TRAF proteins and other intracellular target molecules are recruited, eventually leading to the activation of NIK through an unknown mechanism. NIK contains binding domains that interact with TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6, but the specific roles of TRAF and other proteins in the non-canonical pathway is still controversial. After NIK phosphorylation, IKKα phosphorylates p100, marking it for poly-ubiquitination and partial degradation by the SCFβ-TrCP complex and 26S proteasome. Partial degradation of p100 yields functional p52, which most commonly forms heterodimers with Rel-B and translocates to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription</div></div>
