Signaling through the MyD88 pathway leads to the production of proinflammatory mediators, whereas signaling through the TRIF pathway both activates NF-κB and induces Type I IFNs and IFN-inducible genes. Experiments using MyD88- and TRIF-deficient mice that have been preconditioned with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have led to the hypothesis that TRIF is the key adaptor protein for the TLR4 response to LPS preconditioning, since MyD88-deficient mice can be preconditioned whereas TRIF-deficient mice cannot. In turn, signaling down the TRIF pathway leads to the activation of NF-κB for proinflammatory responses and IRFs for anti-inflammatory responses. The initial TLR4 stimulation by LPS (solid line) may reprogram the subsequent TLR4 response to ischemia to one that activates IRFs and IFN production (dotted line). This reprogramming may be mediated by several pathway inhibitors (e.g., TRIM30α), which are upregulated after LPS preconditioning as well as ischemic insult, and may act to destabilize the TAK1 complex, which in turn blocks NF-κB activation.IFN: Interferon; IRF: IFN-regulatory factors; TAB: Transforming growth factor-B binding protein; TIR: Toll—interleukin 1 receptor; TIRAP: TIR domain-containing adaptor protein; TLR: Toll-like receptor; TRAF: TNF-receptor-associated factor; TRIF: TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN.</div></div>
