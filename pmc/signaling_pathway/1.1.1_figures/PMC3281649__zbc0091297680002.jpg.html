B, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for 4XCSL-Luc and β-galactosidase, along with Notch1-IC, Fe65, Tip60, and the Tip60* mutant as indicated. A and B, after 48 h of transfection, the cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was determined. The data were normalized with β-galactosidase. These results represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. R.L.U., relative luciferase units. We assessed the data for significant differences via Student's t test compared with ΔEN1 or Notch1-IC. *, p &lt; 0.01 (analysis of variance).</div></div>
