Activated JNKs phosphorylate their substrates, which include transcription factors (c-Jun, JunB, JunD, p53, and c-Myc) and mitochondrial proteins (Bcl-2, Bid, Bim, Bax, and Mcl-1), to induce various biological responses.<b>B.</b> The JNK protein contains a conserved dual phosphorylation Thr-Pro-Tyr motif in its activation loop and has a common substrate docking site in C-terminus and a glutamate/aspartate domain in its N-terminus to mediate interactions with MAP2Ks, phosphatases, and substrates.</div></div>
