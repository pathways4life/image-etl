From: VTC4 Is a Bifunctional Enzyme That Affects Myoinositol and Ascorbate Biosynthesis in Plants. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Myoinositol synthesis and metabolism pathway. De novo synthesis of myoinositol (i.e. the Loewus pathway) is catalyzed by myoinositol phosphate synthase (MIPS) and IMP, where its immediate precursor is d-Ins 3-P = l-Ins 1-P. IMP also regenerates myoinositol from the second messenger d-Ins(1,4,5)P3. Oxidation of inositol by myoinositol oxygenase (MIOX) produces d-GlcUA (d-GlcA), which is a possible entry point into ascorbate synthesis. The major route to ascorbate in plants is the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway and utilizes GDP-d-Man. VTC4 has homology to the animal IMPs and has been shown to catalyze the conversion of l-Gal 1-P to l-Gal in the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway. Inositol is also the precursor for the synthesis of several compounds indicated in gray. The asterisk indicates the inositol signaling pathway.</div></div>
