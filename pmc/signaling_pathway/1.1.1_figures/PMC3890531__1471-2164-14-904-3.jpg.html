A</b>: Functional enrichment. Genes differentially expressed between the 2 compartments were evaluated in silico using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The figure shows the most significant functional groups (p &lt; 0.05, FDR &lt; 5%). For each compartment, the gene list corresponds to up regulated genes compared to the other compartments. The bars represent the p-value at logarithmic scale. GC data are in red and oocyte data are in blue. Red and blue numbers correspond to the number of focus genes that contributed to the function concerned. <b>B</b>: Canonical pathways in oocytes and GCs. Significantly enriched canonical pathway categories (p-value &lt; 0.05) identified in the 2 compartments. The Y axis corresponds to percentage gene enrichment in the pathway. Red and blue numbers correspond to the number of focus genes that contributed to the pathway concerned. *: FDR &lt; 0.25 (likely to be valid 3 out of 4 times); **: FDR &lt;0.10; ***: FDR &lt; 0.05. <b>C</b>: Growth factor signaling pathways in oocytes and GCs. Significantly enriched growth factor signaling pathways (p-value &lt; 0.05) identified in the 2 compartments. The Y axis corresponds to percentage gene enrichment in the pathway. Red and blue numbers correspond to the number of focus genes that contributed to the pathway concerned. *: FDR &lt; 0.25; **: FDR &lt;0.10; ***: FDR &lt; 0.05. <b>D</b>: Signaling pathway in oocytes and GCs. Significantly enriched signaling pathways (p-value &lt; 0.05) identified in the 2 compartments. The Y axis corresponds to percentage gene enrichment in the pathway. Red and blue numbers correspond to the number of focus genes that contributed to the pathway concerned. *: FDR &lt; 0.25; **: FDR &lt;0.10; ***: FDR &lt; 0.05.</div></div>
