By simulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, one of the NF-κB profiles (pink data points) that is induced by a specified IKK profile (green line) matches the pattern of the NF-κB profile (purple line) reconstructed from the gene expression data produced by NCA among the three different doses of LPS stimulus. In each conditions of LPS stimulus strength, the pattern of the two NF-κB profiles can be mapped at the time points of 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hours with a Pearson correlation of ~0.99.</div></div>
