Rods release glutamate onto rod ON bipolar cells, which provide an excitatory input to AII amacrine cells, which are electrically coupled to cone ON bipolar cells and inhibit cone OFF bipolar cells. Signaling in this pathway completely depends on the mGluR6 signaling cascade (B). This pathway is affected in cCNSB.(Aii) The secondary rod pathway (rod → cone → bipolar cell). The electrical coupling between rods and cones allows the flow of rod signals into the cones and glutamate release into the cone ON and OFF bipolar cells.(Aiii) The tertiary rod pathway (rod →OFF bipolar cell). A direct glutamatergic input from rods to cone OFF bipolar cell. Note that the latter two pathways are in principle independent of the rod ON bipolar cell signaling pathway (Ai). Red arrows indicate sign-inverting synapses, and green arrows indicate sign-preserving synapses. Abbreviations are as follows: BC, bipolar cell; AC, amacrine cell; GC, ganglion cell.(B) Schematic representation of signaling between photoreceptors and bipolar cells (marked by dashed red circle in panel Ai) and the mGluR6 signaling cascade. Glutamate release from rods depends on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which is regulated by an L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (CACNA1F) in the rod synaptic terminal. Glutamate binds to metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR6 (GRM6) and activates an intracellular cascade involving GαO and Gβ5, leading to the closure of the TRPM1 channel. NYX also plays a role, but its function is currently unknown. GRM6, NYX, and TRPM1 have now been implicated in human cCSNB. 2,6  It is less likely that human patients with mutations in either GαO or Gβ5 will be found, given that the GαO 22  mutation is lethal in mice and Gβ5 has a primary photoreceptor-degeneration phenotype. 23 </div></div>
