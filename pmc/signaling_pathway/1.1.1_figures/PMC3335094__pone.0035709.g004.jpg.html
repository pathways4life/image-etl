From: Mechanical Strain Regulates Osteoblast Proliferation through Integrin-Mediated ERK Activation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The expression values of the selected 5 genes from the MAPK signaling pathway was measured by cDNA microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). MC3T3-E1 cells were stimulated under mechanical strains of 2500 µε, once a day at 0.5 Hz, and a periodicity of 1 h/day for 3 days. Data are represented as the mean ± SD of at least three biological replicates, * P&lt;0.05, ** P&lt;0.01.</div></div>
