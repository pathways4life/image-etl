Normal ESCs from endometriosis-free women were treated with plasmid pEGFP-N1-IDO1 or SD11-IDO1 shRNA, and vector-only plasmid as control. The efficiency of plasmid transfection (A), as well as the phosphorylation level of Erk1/2 (B), JNK (C) and p38 (D) was demonstrated by in-cell Western analysis. Herein, vector control: normal ESCs transfected with vector-only plasmid; IDO1 overexpression: normal ESCs transfected with plasmid pEGFP-N1-IDO1; IDO1 interference: normal ESCs transfected with SD11-IDO1 shRNA. *P&lt;.01, vs. normal group, **P&lt;.01, vs. vector control group. Representative data as well as the mean Â± SD of 12 different experiments were shown.</div></div>
