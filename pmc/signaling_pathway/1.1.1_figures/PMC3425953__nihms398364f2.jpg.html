Left panel represents the activity of the pathway in the normal intestinal epithelial cells. Right panel shows three models of hyperactivation of EGRF/KRAS pathway in the colorectal cancer cells caused by EGFR copy number increased, KRAS and BRAF mutations, respectively. Red star activation; dashed lines â€“ irrelevant signal.</div></div>
