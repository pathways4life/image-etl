(a)Wnt signaling and the TGF-β/BMP-Smad pathway influence each other during bone development. The Wnt pathway participates in R-Smad degradation and so does the Bmp pathway in β-catenin degradation. (b. c)The Wnt canonical pathway: Wnt proteins, following their binding to a frizzled receptor and a Lrp co-receptor (most likely LRP6), activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. These receptors transduce a signal to several intracellular proteins that include Dishevelled (Dsh), glycogen synthase kinase-3β(GSK-3), Axin, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli(APC), and the transcriptional regulator, β-catenin. This results in the translocation to nucleus of β-catenin, β-catenin’s association with members of the Lef1/Tcf family of nuclear proteins, and activation of a specific program of gene expression. (d) Wnt interacts with PTH1R, decreases wnt antagonists, Sost, WIF1 and Dkk expression, and sustains β-catenin stabilization. (e, f) The Wnt noncanonical pathway. The Ca2+ pathway and PCP pathway affect osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis.</div></div>
