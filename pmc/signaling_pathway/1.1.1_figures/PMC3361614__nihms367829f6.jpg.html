Model of multi-component <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> network for NO-induced biofilm formation as a protection mechanism against NO.  From: Nitric oxide modulates bacterial biofilm formation through a multi-component cyclic-di-GMP <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> network. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) The complex multi-component signaling pathway is initiated by NO binding to the sensory H-NOX protein (HnoX), which then inhibits HnoK autophosphorylation. Phosphotransfer establishes a branching of the network to three response regulators. HnoB and HnoD form a feed-forward loop. Phosphorylation controls PDE activity of HnoB, which can be fine-tuned by allosteric control from HnoD. NO-controlled repression of the PDE activity leads to an increase in c-di-GMP levels, which serves as a signaling cue for cellular attachment into biofilms. (B) The NO signal switches the bacterial motility pattern from planktonic growth to increased attachment onto surfaces. The thick layers of cells provide a protective barrier against diffusion of reactive and damaging NO and may protect cells in the lower layers.</div></div>
