One anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody has been developed (bevacizumab). Multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) target the intracellular kinase domain on the VEGF receptors, as well as on other important tyrosine kinases. Five currently approved VSP inhibitors fall into this category (sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib, pazopanib, and vandetanib). Numerous other TKIs are in various stages of development or trials. Other approaches to VSP inhibition that are currently in development or clinical trials include a soluble VEGF receptor, or VEGF-Trap, and a monoclonal antibody generated against VEGFR2.</div></div>
