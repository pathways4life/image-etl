From: Neuronal Death by Oxidative Stress Involves Activation of FOXO3 through a Two-Arm <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> That Activates Stress Kinases and Attenuates Insulin-like Growth Factor I <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Inhibition of IGF-I signaling is involved in neuronal death after H2O2. A competitive interplay between AKT and JNK in regulating FOXO3 activity dictates the neuronal response to an abrupt rise in ROS elicited by H2O2. Cytotoxic levels of H2O2 sequentially activate two independent pathways. A rapid route (1) includes activation of p38 MAPK to inhibit IGF-I signaling by interfering IGF-I receptor/IRS-1 interactions through phosphorylation of serine residues in IRS-1. This leads to abrogation of AKT inhibition of FOXO. A delayed route (2) recruits JNK2 to activate FOXO. Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway is essential because JNK is unable to activate FOXO if AKT is active. Conversely, once JNK activates FOXO, it becomes refractory to inactivation by AKT. The different inhibitory drugs and stimulatory and inhibitory DNA constructs used in this study are indicated.</div></div>
