Leelamine inhibits three key <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways regulating melanoma development.  From: Targeting Multiple Key <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways in Melanoma using Leelamine. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>3A, 3B and 3C.</b> Treatment with 3 to 6 Âµmol/L of leelamine for 3 to 24 hours decreased PI3K/Akt (<b>3A</b>), MAPK (<b>3B</b>) and STAT3 pathways (<b>3C</b>). Signaling inhibition was observed for both UACC 903 and 1205 Lu cell lines, with inhibition of PI3 and MAP kinase pathways occurring at 3 to 6 hours while inhibition of the STAT3 pathway occurred from 12 hours of treatment. Alpha-enolase served as a control for equal protein loading.</div></div>
