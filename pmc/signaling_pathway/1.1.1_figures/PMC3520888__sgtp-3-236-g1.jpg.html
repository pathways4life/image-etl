From: Escorting Ras. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Figure 1.</b> A model of the shuttling of H-Ras or N-Ras between the plasma membrane and endosomes. Activated Ras proteins stimulate the RIN1 effector, which then activates and recruits Rabex-5 to ubiquitylate Ras to facilitate retention in endosomes. 14  One consequence of endosomal internalization is suppression of the signaling output from the Ras pathway (I). 13 â€“ 15  A fraction of the GTP-bound and ubiquitylated Ras can also stimulate ESCRT-III components CHMP6 and VPS4A to enable sorting and recycling of components from the Ras pathway, such as EGFR (and possibly Ras itself) back to the plasma membrane. This pathway apparently enhances Ras signaling (II). 28  Ubiquitylation of Ras in Pathway I forms a negative feedback loop to more efficiently attenuate Ras signaling, while Pathway II acts in a positive feedback loop for sustained and prolonged Ras signaling. Proper balancing of these two pathways can serve to fine tune Ras signaling outputs. Question marks denote many important questions that hopefully will be addressed in the future (see text).</div></div>
