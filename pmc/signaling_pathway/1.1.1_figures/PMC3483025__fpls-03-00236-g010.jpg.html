From: Evidence for a Contribution of ALA Synthesis to Plastid-To-Nucleus <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Model summarizing control mechanisms that act on and are emitted from ALA biosynthesis</b>. The contribution to plastid-derived retrograde signaling is highlighted. ALA formation is posttranslationally controlled by several known feedback mechanisms of the Chl and Mg branch of the pathway (e.g., heme, Mg chelatase assembly, GUN4) also reflecting the impact of the gun2-gun5 mutations on ALA synthesis. Intermediates of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway (e.g., Mg Protoporphyrin IX) were discussed to be involved in signaling pathways and likely act via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated changes in nuclear gene expression (NGE). Gabaculine (GAB) directly inhibits ALA formation resulting in changes of NGE at very early stages of chloroplast development. Norflurazon (NF) inhibits tetrapyrrole biosynthesis indirectly.</div></div>
