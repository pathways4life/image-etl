There are many biological ways to activate or repress the Wnt signaling pathway; these may be therapeutic options for increasing a healing response or reducing uncontrolled proliferation. The use of small molecules, microRNAs, genetically modified cells, as well as ligands and inhibitors, are all potential future therapeutics for both activating and repressing the Wnt signaling pathway.</div></div>
