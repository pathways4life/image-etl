Proposed working model for the CHS3-mediated defense <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>..  From: Autoimmunity conferred by chs3-2D relies on CSA1, its adjacent TNL-encoding neighbour. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The LIM domain was proposed to repress CHS3 activities in the absence of pathogens. SGT1b, which can form a chaperone complex with HSP90 and RAR1, is probably required for the proper assembly of CHS3 activation complex. CHS3 activation relies on its TNL neighbour CSA1, and this signaling pathway appears to primarily rely on SAG101 and EDS1-90.</div></div>
