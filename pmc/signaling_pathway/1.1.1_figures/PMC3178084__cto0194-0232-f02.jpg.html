Proteins at different stages of the pathway from the receptor, transducer, nuclear effecter, and target gene are shown. Expressions of respective genes are downregulated upon addition of insulin to Runx2-null cells (indicated by red arrows), while insulin robustly induces these genes in 3T3-L1 cells (indicated by green arrows).</div></div>
