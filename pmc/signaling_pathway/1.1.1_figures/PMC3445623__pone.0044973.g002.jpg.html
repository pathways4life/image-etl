From: Gene Expression and Functional Annotation of the Human Ciliary Body Epithelia. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">This is one of the canonical pathways that contained statistically significantly more genes than expected by chance in the group of genes that are highly expressed in the non-pigmented epithelium (NPE) of the ciliary body. Gray fields indicate their presence among the highest expressed genes of the NPE; uncolored genes are added by the Ingenuity software to form the pathway. Solid lines between molecules indicate direct physical relationships between molecules (such as regulating and interacting protein dom;ains). Abbreviations of gene names are according to standard abbreviations used in Genbank. This pathway is an example of the endocrine signaling pathways found in the NPE.</div></div>
