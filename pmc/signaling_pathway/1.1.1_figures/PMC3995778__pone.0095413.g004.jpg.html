Structure and relationships between glutamate <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> SNs overrepresented in AD..  From: Overrepresentation of Glutamate <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Alzheimer's Disease: Network-Based <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Enrichment Using Meta-Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">SN gene composition (nodes) and interactions (edges) are shown for: Meta-SN1 in the upper left corner with green edges (which includes GW and GATES modules, GNAZ* gene only present in GW); ADNI-GW SN3 in the bottom left corner with dark blue edges; ADNI-GW SN4 in the bottom right corner with blue edges and ADNI-GW SN7 in the upper right corner with light blue edges. Genes shared by at least 2 SNs are located at the center in bold font and cross interactions between genes inside each module are denoted by light grey edges. Node color represents the OR behavior in a gradient from green to red values (i.e. green: OR&lt;1; red OR&gt;1; white: OR = 1), denoting protection and risk, respectively. Similarly, node size is proportional to the –log10 p-value obtained from the meta-analysis (if absent, node size is the minimum). Triangle shaped nodes marks genes belonging to the glutamate signaling pathway GO term (GO:0007215); Diamond shaped nodes denotes genes belonging to KEGG Glutamatergic synapse pathway (hsa04724); Squares Square shaped nodes denotes genes belonging to both gene ontology term GO:0007215 and KEGG hsa04724 pathway.</div></div>
