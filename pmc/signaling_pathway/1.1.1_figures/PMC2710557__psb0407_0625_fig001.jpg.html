(A) Phenotypes of wild type and FDH:FAE1 before and after spraying with chemical inhibitors. (B) One possible pathway, leading to a lipoapoptosis-like cell death, involves PLA2 that is required for the acyl remodeling of phospholipids, e.g., with VLCFAs. This stimulates the production of a lysosphingophospholipid by a secretory lipase and cell death signaling through the canonical 7TMR-mediated pathway. The involvement of the G-protein signaling in the trichome death could now be tested by crossing knock-out Gα and Gβ mutants with the FDH:FAE1 plants. The non-canonical 7TMR-mediated signaling pathway can be probed, e.g., with chemical inhibitors of calmodulin or protein kinases.</div></div>
