Biological roles of canonical RTK-Ras-ERK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and alternative pathways.  From: Canonical RTK-Ras-ERK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and related alternative pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A) Cell types in the hermaphrodite that require LET-23/EGFR, EGL-15/FGFR and/or LET-60/Ras-dependent signaling are colored according to the type of pathway involved. Not all biological roles are included here due to limited information about the relevant pathway or site of action. Note that many signaling events actually occur during embryogenesis or during larval development, but the locations of relevant cells (or their descendants) in the adult are shown here. B) Photomicrographs of selected mutant phenotypes observed in Ras pathway mutants. Left column, wild type; Right column, mutants. See text for details and references. Scale bar, 10 microns.</div></div>
