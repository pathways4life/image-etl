From: TNF superfamily: costimulation and clinical applications. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">HVEM was originally identified as entry mediator of herpes virus. HVEM signaling is complex as it binds KIGHt as well as LTα3 and is further complicated as LIGHT besides binding HVEM also binds LTRβ. This complex receptor-ligand interactions as well as HSV-HVEM interplay culminate in the expression of of array of signaling molecules, type I IFNs etc.</div></div>
