In each panel, nodes in the upper row represent ligands that significantly regulate respective cytokines (ANOVA). Nodes in the middle row represent significant pathways identified by PCR minimal models. Edges between top and middle rows represent significant signaling pathway regulation by the given ligands (ANOVA). Edges between top and bottom rows, or middle and bottom rows, represent significant participation identified by PCR minimal models. Weak activation of signaling pathways is indicated by dashed edges. Light gray: pathways demonstrated in the literature to not play any role (false positives).</div></div>
