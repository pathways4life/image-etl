Serum starved cells were treated with ACS-1 for 2 hours and stimulated with EGF. (A) Western blot analysis of EGF signaling pathway activation in response to EGF and/or ACS-1. (B) Graphical representation of Akt activation in MB231 cells; ratios of P-Akt-(ser 473):total Akt are presented as percent of EGF control (mean ± SD). (C) Western blot analysis of ACS-1 effects on EGF signaling in A549 cells. (D) Graphical representation of Akt activation in A549 cells; ratios of P-Akt-(ser 473):total Akt are presented as percent of EGF control (mean ± SD). (E) Representative western blot analysis of P-mTOR-(ser 2448) in MB231 cells treated with ACS-1 and stimulated with EGF.</div></div>
