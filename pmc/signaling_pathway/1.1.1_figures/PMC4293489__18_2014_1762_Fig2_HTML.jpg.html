At low concentrations, sLPS or rLPS are unable to activate TLR4 without the involvement of CD14 (<b>d</b>). At higher doses of sLPS, CD14 is dispensable for initiation of MyD88-dependent pathway of TLR4, although the production of TNF-α is submaximal in these conditions (<b>e</b>). When present in relatively high concentrations, rLPS can induce submaximal activation of both signaling pathways of TLR4 without binding to CD14 (<b>f</b>)</div></div>
