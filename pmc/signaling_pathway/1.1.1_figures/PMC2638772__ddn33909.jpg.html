From: FGFR3 promotes synchondrosis closure and fusion of ossification centers through the MAPK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model whereby increased Fgfr3 signaling in chondrocytes causes premature synchondrosis closure and unification of ossification centers. Increased Fgfr3 signaling induces premature exit from the cell cycle and accelerates the transition into hypertrophic chondrocytes. Increased Fgfr3 signaling also causes upregulation of Vegf in chondrocytes, promoting vascular invasion. Increased secretion of Bmp ligands and decreased secretion of Bmp antagonists result in enhanced osteoblast differentiation of osteoprogenitors in the periosteum, promoting bone formation and fusion of ossification centers. The upregulation of Vegf and Bmps and downregulation of Bmp antagonists are at least partially mediated by the MAPK pathway.</div></div>
