From: CD83 increases MHC II and CD86 on dendritic cells by opposing IL-10-driven MARCH1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Summary of CD83 pathway regulating display of MHC II and CD86 on DCs.</b> CD83 mRNA is induced by TLR signaling, whereas MARCH1 mRNA is induced by IL-10 and diminished by TLR signaling. The CD83 TM binds to MARCH1, decreasing MARCH1 association with the TM segments of MHC II or CD86 and preventing ubiquitination of lysines in their cytoplasmic tails by the MARCH1 RING-CH domain, thereby promoting MHC II or CD86 surface display.</div></div>
