Correlations between Jak/Stat and PI3K <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> activity with apoptotic responses..  From: Distinct Patterns of DNA Damage Response and Apoptosis Correlate with Jak/Stat and PI3Kinase Response Profiles in Human Acute Myelogenous Leukemia. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Scatter plots were generated to determine the correlations between pathway activity (PCA analysis of modulated Jak/Stat and PI3K signaling) with apoptosis responses to etoposide and staurosporine. Filled blue circles denote samples from CR patients and unfilled red squares denote samples from NR patients. (A) Scatter plot to show correlations between response to etoposide and staurosporine with exemplary 2D flow plots (B) showing Jak/Stat pathway responses after treatment with a specific modulator. (C) Scatter plots showing correlations between PCA of Jak/Stat pathway activity with either etoposide or staurosporine. (D) Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients and probabilities show a general inverse correlation between Jak/Stat pathway activity with apoptotic responsiveness to staurosporine but not to etoposide with outliers shown in the plot. (E) Scatter plot to show correlations between response to etoposide and staurosporine with exemplary 2D flow plots (F) showing PI3K pathway responses after treatment with a specific modulator. (G) Scatter plots showing correlations between PCA of PI3K pathway activity with either etoposide or staurosporine. (H) Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients and probabilities show a general inverse correlation between PI3K pathway activity with apoptotic responsiveness to etoposide and staurosporine with outliers shown in the plot.</div></div>
