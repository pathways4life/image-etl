From: mTOR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in protein homeostasis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">mTOR signaling pathway. mTORC1 and mTORC2 receive distinct upstream signals from both extracellular and intracellular stimuli and have different downstream targets. Notably, interconnection between mTORC1 and mTORC2 occurs at several levels. For example, one of the mTORC2 downstream targets, Akt, serves as an upstream regulator of mTORC1, whereas one important mTORC1 target ribosome acts as an activator of mTORC2. Most of the signaling components are involved in growth and aging, and lots of mutations have been found in human diseases such as cancer. For simplicity, only typical mTOR components are shown.
