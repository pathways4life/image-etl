From: Inborn Errors of Human JAKs and STATs. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The signaling and inhibitions of STAT3 are shown, with areas of special emphasis for the dominant negative mutants shown. Crosshatched STAT3 depicts the AD-mutant form of the molecule, with each heterodimer in which it participates being inhibited from function. The thunderbolts are to indicate where a normal function is being inhibited. STAT3 is both involved in IL-10 signal transduction and in IL-10 expression, both of which are affected in Jobâ€™s syndrome.</div></div>
