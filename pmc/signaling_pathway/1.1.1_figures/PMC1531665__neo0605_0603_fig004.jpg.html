From: Activation of the Erk <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Is Required for TGF-?1-Induced EMT In Vitro. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of TGF-β1-induced Erk activation and EMT being blocked by U0126. TGF-β1 may activate the Erk pathway through upstream factors, such as Ras/Raf, or directly through more downstream factors, such as MEK or Erk. To investigate the role of Erk signaling in TGF-β1-mediated EMT, the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, was used to block Erk phosphorylation in NMuMG and MCT cells. In these cells, TGF-β1 induction of Erk activity and EMT was blocked by U0126. However, TGF-β1 may activate other pathways, such as p38, JNK, PI3-kinase, and RhoA, to induce EMT in other cell types.</div></div>
