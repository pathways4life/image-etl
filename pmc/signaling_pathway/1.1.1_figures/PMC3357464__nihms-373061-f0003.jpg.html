(A) Filamin interacts with TRAF2, MEKK4, and JNK to allow for JNK activation upon TNFR1 engagement. ERK1/2 and p38 might similarly be organized into stimulus-specific modules through yet unidentified scaffolding proteins. (B) Binding of NEMO to IKK2 allows for its activation but is also required for proper signaling propagation to IκBα in response to inflammatory signals. (C) NIK is not only the activating kinase of IKK1 but also channels IKK1 activity to p100.</div></div>
