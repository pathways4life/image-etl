Enrichment of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and chemokine signaling pathways leads to activation of various pro-survival pathways like Jak-STAT pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and NFkB pathway with the resultant pro-tumorigenic environment. <b>B</b>) TCGA patients (n = 108) were divided into gene expression sub types – proneural, neural, mesenchymal and classical among low risk and high risk groups. Mann Whitney test was carried out to find out significance of distribution of a given expression subtype within a risk group.</div></div>
