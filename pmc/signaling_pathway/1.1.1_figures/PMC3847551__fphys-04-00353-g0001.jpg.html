The IPCs modulate feeding and locomotor (shaded) behavior through the insulin pathway. Decreased insulin production/release from the brain IPCs results in decreased downstream insulin signaling and leads to increased ethanol (EtOH) sensitivity and motivated foraging. Decreased insulin signaling in sNPFR (short Neuropeptide F Receptor) expressing odor receptor neurons (ORNs) and in NPFR (Neuropeptide F Receptor) expressing neurons, increases the sensitivity of ORNs to odors and increases the attraction of flies towards normally aversive or noxious food sources, respectively. With respect to locomotion, octopaminergic neurons signal through the IPCs to promote wake; however, this effect is independent of insulin signaling. Insulin signaling in the corpus allatum (CA), a non-neuronal endocrine gland (indicated by square), drives sexual dimorphism of locomotor patterns. Lastly, insulin signaling in the circadian small ventrolateral neurons (sLNVs) modifies the sensitivity of rest: Lactivity rhythms to oxidative stress.</div></div>
