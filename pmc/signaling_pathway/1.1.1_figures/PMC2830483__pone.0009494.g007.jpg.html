Schematic illustrating relationship between WWP-1 and DAF-2 insulin-like signal network..  From: WWP-1 Is a Novel Modulator of the DAF-2 Insulin-Like <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Network Involved in Pore-Forming Toxin Cellular Defenses in Caenorhabditis elegans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In the canonical DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway in C. elegans, DAF-2 regulates DAF-16 through the activation of PI3K, composed of AGE-1 and AAP-1 for the catalytic subunit and the regulatory subunit respectively. PI3K activates the activity of PDK-1, which eventually inhibits the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of DAF-16. Here we demonstrate that the attenuated DAF-2 signal can also regulate an additional DAF-16-independent signal arm that diverges form PDK-1 to WWP-1 to defense against Cry5B PFT.</div></div>
