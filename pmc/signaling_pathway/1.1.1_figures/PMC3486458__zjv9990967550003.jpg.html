(A) PK-15 cells were treated as described in Fig. 2C, and whole-cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis for LC3-II, p-mTOR, total mTOR, p-ERK1/2, and total ERK1/2. (B) Ratios of p-mTOR, p-ERK1/2, and LC3-II to β-actin were normalized to mock infection, set at 1.0. (C and D) PK-15 cells were treated as in Fig. 2G, and their ratios to β-actin were normalized to mock infection, set at 1.0.</div></div>
