Notch signaling pathway activation results in cleavage of Notch by γ-secretase into Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that translocates to nucleus, a process that is known to be inhibited by multiple phytochemicals. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as PDGFR, IGFR, EGFR etc., activate PI3K–Akt–mTOR signaling pathway, and this pathway is also known to be regulated by phytochemicals at different steps. Binding of wnt ligand to its receptor Frizzled activates Dishevelled (DSH) leading to attenuation of GSK-3β-mediated repression of β-catenin. β-Catenin also translocates to nucleus resulting in induction of downstream signaling molecules, and this pathway is modulated by phytochemicals as well. Inhibition of these multiple signaling pathways represents a mechanism by which phytochemicals influence the phenotype of CSCs</div></div>
