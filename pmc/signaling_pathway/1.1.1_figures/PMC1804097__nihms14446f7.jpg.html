From: Bad as a converging <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> molecule between survival PI3-K/Akt and death JNK in neurons after transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic depicting the effect of the PI3-K/Akt pathway and the JNK pathway on Bad activation in the peripheral area after brain ischemia/reperfusion injury and pharmacological manipulation. The PI3-K/Akt pathway promotes phosphorylation of Bad and the association of Bad with 14-3-3, which mediates cell survival. In contrast, the JNK pathway encourages the dissociation of Bad from 14-3-3, the dephosphorylation of Bad, and the dimerization of Bad with Bcl-XL or Bcl-2, followed by cell death. After ischemia/reperfusion injury, the signal balance between the PI3-K/Akt pathway and the JNK pathway regulates Bad activation. Bad might play a crucial role as a determinant of cell fate after cerebral ischemia.
