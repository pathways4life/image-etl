(A) Application of a slowly increasing stimulus (Left, gray line) to pathway A and a square pulse lasting 45 min (Left, dashed gray line) to pathway B. Temporal profiles of the shared component C (Left, black line) and the terminal kinases KA (Right, solid line) and KB (Right, dashed line) are shown. (B) The same as in A, except the square pulse is applied to pathway B after a 1-h delay. (C) The same as in A, except the square pulse is applied after a 4-h delay. In this case, saturation of the common component C prevents signaling through pathway B.</div></div>
