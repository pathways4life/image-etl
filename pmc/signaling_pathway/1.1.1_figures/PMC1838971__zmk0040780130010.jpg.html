From: Nerve Growth Factor-mediated Neurite Outgrowth via Regulation of Rab5. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of NGF/TrkA-mediated Rab5 inactivation and establishment of signaling endosomes. NGF binds TrkA and induces its endocytosis. TrkA-associated RabGAP5 inactivates Rab5 by promoting its GTP hydrolysis. As a result, the TrkA-containing endocytic vesicles cannot fuse with early endosomes and enter the endocytic pathway. This population of TrkA-containing endocytic vesicles is thus diverted from the conventional endocytic pathway and specializes to become the signaling endosomes.</div></div>
