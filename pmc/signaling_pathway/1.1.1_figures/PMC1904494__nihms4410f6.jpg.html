(<b>d</b>) HCMV induced stress fiber disassembly, which correlated with UL94 nuclear translocation. (<b>e</b>) Stress fiber disassembly and UL94 nuclear translocation were inhibited by blocking PI3-K or Src signaling. The inhibition was relieved by Y-27632. Cytochalasin B (Cyto B) facilitated HCMV nuclear translocation.</div></div>
