Pink links represent interactions found in this study, and gray links are manually curated interactions from the literature. The molecular function of each protein is described by a color code, and interactors are grouped according to their belonging to specific signaling pathways. GAP, GTPase-activating protein; TGF, transforming growth factor; PKC, protein kinase C; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; NFKB, nuclear factor ÎºB; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; CaM, calmodulin.</div></div>
