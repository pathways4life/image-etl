Activation and downregulation of NOD2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>.

RIP2 undergoes tyrosine autophosphorylation and is ubiquitinated by a number of E3 ligases. RIP2 also promotes ubiquitination of NEMO/IKK γand by doing so links together proximal and distal signaling components of the pathway. The TAB proteins of the TAK1/TAB2/TAB3 complex bind these ubiquitin chains allowing TAK1 to phosphorylate and activate the IKK complex. IKK activation leads to IκBα phosphorylation, marking IκB for degradation and liberating NF-κB for translocation to the nucleus. B) TRAF4 inhibits NOD2 signaling in a manner dependent on NOD2 binding and IKKα-mediated phosphorylation. The downstream events mediating such inhibition are unknown. A20 is phosphorylated and activated by IKKβ and together with ITCH, targets activated, tyrosine phosphorylated RIP2 for degradation. In a manner independent of its ubiquitin editing function, A20 also inhibits TAK1-mediated phosphorylation of IKK.</div></div>
