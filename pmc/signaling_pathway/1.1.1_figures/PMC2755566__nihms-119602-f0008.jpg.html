Proposed mechanism of intracrine PTHrP regulation of apoptosis, involving integrin α6β4 and the PI3-K/Akt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>.  From: Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein Regulates Cell Survival Pathways via Integrin ?6?4-mediated Activation of PI3-K/Akt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PTHrP increases cell surface levels of integrin α6β4, which signals synergistically with growth factor receptors to activate the PI3-K/Akt pathway. This results in phosphorylation, and therefore inactivation of GSK-3. Since GSK-3 is known to phosphorylate c-myc, thereby targeting it to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, inactivation of GSK-3 results in increased c-myc levels and therefore decreased apoptosis. The PI3-K/Akt pathway also regulates the Bcl-2 family of proteins, resulting in decreased apoptosis. Thus, the net effect of intracrine PTHrP signaling in C4-2 cells is increased cell survival.</div></div>
