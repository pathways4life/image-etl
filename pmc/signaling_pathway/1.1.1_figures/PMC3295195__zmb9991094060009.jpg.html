(A) At 48 h after transfection with different Cav siRNAs or scrambled control siRNA, quiescent cells lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with indicated antibodies following exposure to indicated stimuli for 10 min. (B to D) At 48 h after siRNA transfection as indicated, quiescent AT1R/Cl4 cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting analysis with indicated antibodies (B) or the cells were subjected to induction of EMT with Ang II as indicated in Fig. 1, cell photographs were taken at Ã—400 magnification following FITC-conjugated phalloidin staining (C), and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting analysis with the indicated antibodies (D).</div></div>
