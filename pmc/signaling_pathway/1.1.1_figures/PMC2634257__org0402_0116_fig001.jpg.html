(A) Canonical Pathway. A Wnt ligand binds to a Frizzled receptor and a co-receptor of low density lipoprotein (Lrp) family. Dishevelled (Dvl) and β-catenin are required to transduce the Wnt signal, leading to a transcriptional response mediated by transcription factors of the Tcf/Lef1 family. (B) Planar cell Polarity pathway. In this pathway, Dvl also transduces signals although independent of β-catenin activating JNK and Rho kinase cascades. (C) The Wnt/Ca2+ pathway signals via heterotrimeric G-proteins to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and stimulate protein kinase C (PKC). The requirement for Dvl is controversial. In vertebrates this pathway is activated by the same ligands as (B). Dapper, a Dvl-associated antogonist, antagonizes both (A and B) pathways.</div></div>
