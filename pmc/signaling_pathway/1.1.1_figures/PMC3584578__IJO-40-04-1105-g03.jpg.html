(A) U251, LN229, A172 and U87 cells were treated with the miR-451 mimics and LKB1, AMPK, p-AMPK, PI3K, p-AKT and GAPDH expressions were determined by Western blotting 48 h after treatment. (B) Schematic diagram of how miR-451 downregulation could lead to activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.</div></div>
