Nitric oxide, generated by nitric oxide synthase, diffuses across the plasma membrane and through the cytoplasm. In leukocytes NO reacts with the active site of guanylyl cyclase (guanylate GC), and stimulates the production of the intracellular mediator cyclic GMP (cGMP). Next, cGMP interacts with the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), which phosphorylates multiple substrates, and participates in signal propagation. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs, not shown) can rapidly hydrolyze cGMP and terminate signal propagation. The NO/cGMP signaling pathway can be specifically targeted using small molecules. The nitric oxide donor provides an exogenous source of NO. The activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase binds to GC, and induces enzyme activation in the absence of NO. The cell permeable analog of cGMP diffuses across the plasma membrane, and thus, activates cGMP-dependent signaling.</div></div>
