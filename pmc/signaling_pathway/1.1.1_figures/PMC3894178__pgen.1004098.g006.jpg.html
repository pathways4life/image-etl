Nutrition information is mediated by JH signaling and promote mandible enlargement in males. DsxM (CmDsxA and CmDsxB) might play a promoting role for JH-dependent mandible enlargement or recruiting other signaling pathway such as insulin signaling pathway (ISS). In females, DsxF (CmDsxC and CmDsxD) inhibit JH effect by reducing the JH sensitivity of mandible cell.</div></div>
