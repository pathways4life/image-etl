Fat <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and Dachs polarity in the wing disc.  From: Propagation of Dachsous-Fat Planar Cell Polarity. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A) Simplified schematic of the Fat signaling pathway. Fat is regulated by Dachsous and Four-jointed. Fat regulates Hippo signaling (red arrows) through Dachs, and regulates PCP signaling (green arrows) partly through Dachs and partly independently of Dachs. B) Schematic of wing disc with the Ds gradient indicated in magenta, and the direction of Dachs polarization indicated by green arrows. The A-P and D-V compartment boundaries are indicated by thin black lines, and Wg expression is indicated in red. C) Dachs:Cit polarization in a wing disc with wild-type Ds and Fj expression, stained for Wg (red), hh-Gal4 (yellow, revealed by Dcr2 staining from a UAS-Dcr2 transgene), and E-cadherin (E-cad, blue, outlines all cells). The polarity of Dachs localization is indicated by small white arrows pointing in the direction of Dachs:Cit membrane localization. Large Red arrow points to the D-V Wg stripe. D) Ds protein staining in a wild-type wing disc. E) Fj expression in a wild-type wing disc, revealed by a fj-lacZ transgene.</div></div>
