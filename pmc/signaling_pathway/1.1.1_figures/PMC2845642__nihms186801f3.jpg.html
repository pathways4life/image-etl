Ligation of the TCR by peptide–MHC on an APC triggers the recruitment of the TCR and signaling elements, e.g. phospholipase C-1 (PLC-1) for the Ca2+ influx–nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway and PKC- for the NF- B and AP-1 pathway, which control nuclear transcriptional and gene activation to lipid rafts. To induce differentiation to an IFN-γ producing Th1 cell, STAT4 activation coupled with NFAT activated by the TCR induces the expression of T-bet. In turn T-bet and NFAT induce the expression of IFN-γ. Current findings suggest that inhibition of PI3K, PKC, and PLC (in red) block CD80 induced increase in IFN-γ production. This supports the hypothesis that stimulation via CD80 on CD4+ T cells positively regulates effector Th1 function. Cross-linking CD80 on T cells induces an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple intracellular proteins, and increases the level of IFN-γ and T-bet transcription. Findings indicate that cross-linking CD80 on CD4+ T cells activated in Th1-promoting conditions increases the level of IFN-γ produced by increasing the rate of IFN-γ transcription via the activation of a Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway.</div></div>
