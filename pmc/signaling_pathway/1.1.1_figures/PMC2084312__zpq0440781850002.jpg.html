From: Functional screening identifies miR-315 as a potent activator of Wingless <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Placement and specificity of miR-315 activity relative to the Wg pathway. (A) Epistasis test. The effect of ectopic miR-315 on TCF-luc was determined in the presence of dsRNAs against various positive components of the canonical Wg signaling pathway. In clone 8 cells, miR-315 acts downstream of the Wg ligand and its receptors (Fz and Arr) but upstream of the nuclear components legless, Arm, and dTCF. (B) Specificity test. miR-315 had no effect on a reporter for transcriptional output of the JAK/STAT pathway (10X-STAT92-luc) and no effect on a reporter for transcriptional output of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway (ptcÎ”136-luc) under either Hh-stimulated or unstimulated conditions.
