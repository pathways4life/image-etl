The classic reelin pathway involves VLDL and ApoER2 receptors and Dab1 as shown on the left in shades of pink; PI3K is also an integral part of reelin signaling. Neuregulin (NRG1) signaling progresses primarily through erbB receptors and pathways leading to PI3K activation (shades of green) or involvement of the Notch signaling pathway (indicated in shades of purple). Activation of Notch results in upregulation of BLBP production. In certain radial glial cells, blockade of PI3K can be compensated by NRG1 signaling through erbB receptors that coordinate with Notch.</div></div>
