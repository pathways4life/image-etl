From: FAK and paxillin. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Regulation of Rac activity by FAK paxillin.</b> (A) FAK/p130cas stimulates Rac activation, whereas FAK/paxillin may inhibit Rac activity. This may occur via direct targeting of Rac by FAK/paxillin-associated regulators of Rac (1). Alternatively, FAK/paxillin signaling may interfere via crosstalk with a distinct signaling pathway (X) that promotes Rac activation (2). (B) In this schematic of the edge of a cell, peripheral Rac activity is low (red), whereas nonperipheral Rac activity is high (green). At the periphery, FAK/paxillin may function to reduce Rac activity. This could be achieved by discrete relocalization of FAK/paxillin or spatially dependent modulation of the Rac-inhibiting activity of FAK/paxillin. (C) In this schematic of two cells in contact, FAK/paxillin signaling and N-cadherin signaling may both contribute to the reduced levels of active Rac near cellâ€“cell junctions.</div></div>
