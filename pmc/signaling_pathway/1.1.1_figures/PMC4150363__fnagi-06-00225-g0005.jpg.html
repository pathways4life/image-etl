Cortical and hippocampal proteins exhibiting differential regulation between BTBR and control mice were analyzed for potential functional pathway interactions using KEGG (<b>A</b>-cortex, <b>B</b>-hippocampus) and Ingenuity Canonical Signaling pathway analysis (<b>C</b>-cortex, <b>D</b>-hippocampus). For <b>(A,B)</b>, the top 10 most significantly-populated (calculated with Hybrid scores: enrichment factor (R) * (âˆ’log10 enrichment probability, P) neuronally-specific KEGG or Canonical signaling pathways are shown.</div></div>
