The presence of proteins in the TLR9-signaling pathway and phosphorylated forms of PKD in the resulting immunoprecipitates were detected by Western blot. <b>B,</b> The indicated endogenous proteins in the TLR9-signaling pathway in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated. The presence of FLAG-tagged PKD family proteins and proteins in the TLR9-signaling pathway in the resulting immunoprecipitates were detected by Western blot.</div></div>
