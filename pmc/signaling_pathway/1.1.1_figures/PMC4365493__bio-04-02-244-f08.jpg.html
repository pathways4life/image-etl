CD74 interacts with CD44, which mediates signal transduction through MAPK/ERK. ERK has been reported to repress the mTOR complex via the PI3K/Akt pathway to induce the formation of autophagosomes, which later fuse with lysosomes to become autophagolysosomes and degrade proteins. Both MIF-induced junction protein translocation and degradation could increase vascular permeability.</div></div>
