Binding of neurotrophins (BDNF or NGF) to Trk receptors activates multiple signaling pathways, including Ras/MAPK cascade, PKC, PI3K/AKT, and IP3/calcium signaling [72,73]. Stimulation of NRG1 activates MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways [74]. These signal transductions trigger activation of several TFs such as CREB, CBP, EGR1 and EGR3, which subsequently activate their target genes (e.g., EGR3, BCL2 and NPY). Calcium influx through NMDARs activates calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway, then activates target genes such as EGR3 [46,49]. EGR3 regulates its target genes (e.g., GABRA4, ARC and NGFR) and miRNAs (e.g., hsa-miR-195 and hsa-miR-20b).</div></div>
