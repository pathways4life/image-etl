EDA-A1 or EDA-A5 (ref. 43) activate the canonical NF-κB pathway via EDAR and p65/p50, which then signal to Wnt and BMP pathways and their antagonists for hair follicle induction, to Shh and its inhibitors for hair follicle growth, and to the alternative NF-κB pathway, involving LTβ and RelB, for hair-type differentiation. +, positive up-regulation; −, negative regulation (suppression).</div></div>
