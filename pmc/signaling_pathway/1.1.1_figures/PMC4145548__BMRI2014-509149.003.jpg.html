The Entrez gene ID is shown for each gene in the p53 pathway. The pathway genes are clustered based on the functional similarity distances between each two genes, as calculated by FSim. A subcluster of 13 genes were highlighted in red rectangle. Eleven of these 13 genes were in the same apoptosis pathway except for TSC2 (Entrez ID 7249) and GADD45A (Entrez ID 1647).</div></div>
