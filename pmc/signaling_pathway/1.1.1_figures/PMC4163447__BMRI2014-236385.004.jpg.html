(a) RT-qPCR analysis was performed using randomly selected genes (Mapk3, Raf1, and Ccnd2), which involved the insulin/PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Expression of mRNAs in livers (left) and pancreas (right) of control and Cmah-null mice were downregulated (*P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01). (b) Dysregulated miRNAs and their target genes which involved in insulin/PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in liver and pancreas of Cmah-null mouse. Red and blue present the refined pathways and putative miRNAs, respectively. Black indicates putative target genes for their pathway.</div></div>
