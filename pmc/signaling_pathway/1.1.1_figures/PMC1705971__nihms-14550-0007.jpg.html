The schematic shows a number of the steps involved in the autophagy process and the relative position of the event most likely to be controlled by Ras/PKA signaling activity. B, schematic depicting the relative order of action of the Ras/PKA and Tor signaling pathways on the autophagy process. The data presented here, and in other recent studies, are consistent with the Ras/PKA pathway acting either (i) independently or (ii) downstream of the Tor signaling pathway.
