As with any signaling cascade, there must be a mechanism in place to down-regulate the cascade after a prolonged period of activation. O-GlcNAcylation of key molecules can achieve this via the translocation of OGT in response to insulin.A) During normal cellular conditions and early insulin mediated signaling, OGT (blue) is localized within the nucleus. Upon insulin stimulation, insulin (light green) binds the insulin receptor (IR, light blue) causing its autophosphorylation at tyrosine residues (PY, red circles). Phosphorylation of the IR recruits IRS-1 (light red) to the membrane. IRS-1 is phosphorylated at multiple tyrosine residues, resulting in its binding to the p85 regulatory subunit (brown) of PI3K. PI3K then catalyzes the production of PIP3 (light blue) at the plasma membrane. PIP3 recruits PDK-1which increases the phosphorylation of AKT at threonine-308 (PT, red circle) causing its activation. Activated AKT then phosphorylates various substrates. Phosphorylation of GSK3β results in an increase in glycogen production. Phosphorylation of FOXO results in a decrease in transcription of gluconeogenic genes. Phosphorylation of AS160 results in increased GLUT4 translocation.B) As a response to prolonged insulin signaling, a subset of OGT translocates from the nucleus to the plasma membrane and binds PIP3 through a PIP3 binding domain at its C-terminus. At the membrane, OGT is tyrosine phosphorylated by the IR leading to an increase in OGT’s activity. Active OGT can O-GlcNAcylate key molecules namely p85/p110, PDK1, AKT, and FOXO to alter insulin signaling. O-GlcNAcylation (green circles) of IRS-1 can decrease its interaction with p85, decrease its activating phosphorylation at tyrosine-608 (thereby reducing its activity), while increasing its phosphorylation at serines-632 and 635. O-GlcNAcylation of AKT, results in a decrease in its activating phosphorylation of threonine-308. This causes a decrease in phosphorylation of GSK3β, FOXO, and AS160. Decreasing phosphorylation of GSK3β results in decreased glycogen production. Decreasing phosphorylation of FOXO (along with increasing its O-GlcNAcylation) results in an increase in gluconeogenic genes. Decreasing phosphorylation of AS160 results in a decrease in GLUT4 translocation. Taken together O-GlcNAcylation of specific proteins within the insulin signaling pathway can result in a “dampening” effect of the insulin mediated signal.</div></div>
