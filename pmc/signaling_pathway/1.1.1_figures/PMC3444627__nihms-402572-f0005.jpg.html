Below subfigure shows that the expression of Osx is more sensitivity to V8, K8 and d8, as well as to V1, K1, d1 and V7, K7. These results show us which kinetic parameters and molecules are more important in the system and also demonstrate that the developed intracellular pathway system is robust.</div></div>
