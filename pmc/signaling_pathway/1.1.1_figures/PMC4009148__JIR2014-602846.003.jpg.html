From: Potential Involvement of IL-17F in Asthma. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Signaling mechanism of IL-17F expression in bronchial epithelial cells. Bronchial epithelial cells are a novel cell source of IL-17F. The expression of IL-17F is induced by IL-33. IL-33 binds to its receptor, ST2, and then the ERK1/2-MSK1 signaling pathway is activated. However, other stimuli inducing IL-17F and their signaling pathways are largely unknown.</div></div>
