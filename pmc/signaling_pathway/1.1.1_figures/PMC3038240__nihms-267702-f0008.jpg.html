Jnk activates apoptosis, but also cell proliferation. Activation of proliferation is mediated through Hippo signaling. The ultimate target of Jnk signaling within the Hippo pathway is not known, it could act upstream of Wts and Hpo, but might act in parallel to them (dashed lines and question mark). Yki both promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis through transcriptional regulation of downstream target genes.</div></div>
