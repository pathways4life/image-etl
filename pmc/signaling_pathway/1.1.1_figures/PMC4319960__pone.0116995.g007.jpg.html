Activation of the SMAD pathway is required for the induction of a cellular program of growth-arrest and myofibroblast differentiation. In contrast, activation of the p38 MAPK pathway, independently of SMAD2/3, is required the down-regulation of Cav-1 by TGF-β1. Down-regulation of Cav-1 by TGF-β1 “primes” differentiated myofibroblasts for enhanced proliferative responses to mitogens and resistance to apoptosis. These divergent TGF-β signaling pathways may explain, in part, the contextual effects of TGF-β1 as both a growth-inhibitor and –promoter on the same target (mesenchymal) cells.</div></div>
