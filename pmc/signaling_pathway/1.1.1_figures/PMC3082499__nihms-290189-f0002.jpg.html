(a) The protein domain structures of Fas and TNFR-1. Each receptor has cysteine-rich domains (CRD) in the ligand binding region, characteristic of members of the TNF superfamily of receptors. There is a death domain in the intracellular portion of each receptor. (b) Fas death signaling patheways. (c) TNFR-1 signaling pathways. See text for details.</div></div>
