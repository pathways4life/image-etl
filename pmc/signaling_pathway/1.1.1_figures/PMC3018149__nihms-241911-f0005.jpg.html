From: Up Regulation of DLX5 Promotes Ovarian Cancer Cell Proliferation by Enhancing IRS-2-AKT <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A wobbled DLX5 cDNA prevents DLX5 knockdown-induced cell cycle arrest. (A) WST-1 assays were performed to determine cell viability/proliferation after transduction of DLX5 shRNA2 and a Flag-DLX5 cDNA containing three wobbled codons at the shRNA2 targeted sites. (B) The wobbled DLX5 cDNA restores cyclin levels as well as AKT signaling. Immunoblotting was performed to analyze expression levels of DLX5, cyclins A, B1 and D2, various AKT pathway members, as well as IRS-2 and MET.</div></div>
