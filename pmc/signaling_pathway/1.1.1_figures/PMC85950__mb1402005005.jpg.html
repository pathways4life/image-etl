Primary rat hepatocytes were transiently transfected with the following DNAs: A, 5.5 μg of p−4500/+66hTBP-luc together with 1.7 μg of RasV12 or RasV12-C40; B, 5.5 μg of c-fos promoter-luc together with 1.7 μg of RasV12 or RasV12-C40. Wortmannin (0.5 μM) was added where indicated to cells 14 h prior to harvesting of the transfected cells.</div></div>
