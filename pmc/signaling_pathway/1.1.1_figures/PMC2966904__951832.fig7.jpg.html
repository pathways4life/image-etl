From: Transferrin receptor 2 and HFE regulate furin expression via mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/Erk) <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>. Implications for transferrin-dependent hepcidin regulation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed scheme of the signaling pathway by TfR2 and HFE. Holotransferrin by binding to TfR2 in a complex with HFE, induces Erk1/2 phosphorylation. This, in turn, induces furin expression possibly acting also on the SMAD1/5/8 pathway. Furin participates in the maturation of hepcidin, and of the BMP, which induce hepcidin expression. It also produces the soluble form of HJV, which has an inhibitory effect on hepcidin expression.</div></div>
