The pre-osteoblast pro-proliferating signal induced by MOS-J/POS-1 CMs was transmitted via JAKs/PI3-K/Akt/mTOR pathway. “Soluble factor(s)”: Pro-proliferating factor(s) of pre-osteoblast cell produced by osteosarcoma cells. Solid line arrow: The responsible signaling pathway for pre-osteoblast proliferation induced by MOS-J/POS-1 CMs. Dotted line arrow: MOS-J/POS-1 CMs-induced but non-responsible signaling pathway for pre-osteoblast proliferation.</div></div>
