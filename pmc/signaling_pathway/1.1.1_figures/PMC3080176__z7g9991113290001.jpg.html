(<b>A</b>) Top ten biological functions associated with gene expression changes between wild-type and XOPS-mCFP retinas. The y-axis represents the negative log of the p-value associated with the probability that each biological function was identified due to chance alone. (<b>B</b>) Top eleven canonical signaling pathways associated with differentially expressed genes. The blue bars represent the negative log of the p-value associated with the probability that each pathway was identified due to chance alone. The orange squares represent a ratio of the number of molecules from the microarray dataset that were associated with a given canonical pathway divided by the total number of molecules that map to that pathway.</div></div>
