Activation of these stress-sensitive kinases, which can also be triggered by endoplasmic reticulum stress (36), results in serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, blocking downstream insulin signaling. (<b>B</b>) Stimulation of insulin and GLP1 receptors blocks AβO-induced defects in insulin signaling. Binding of exendin-4 to GLP1 receptors and of insulin to IRs prevented activation of JNK, allowing physiological tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and stimulating downstream insulin signaling. In both panels, red arrows indicate inhibitory pathways and green arrows indicate stimulatory pathways of insulin signaling. I, insulin. </div></div>
