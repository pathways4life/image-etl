A, C3H 10T1/2 cells were treated with (+T) or without 100 nm testosterone (Con) for 3 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated, and mouse TGF-β signaling pathway genes were analyzed by SuperArray. Open circular spots represent some of the TGF-β signaling pathway target genes, which were regulated by testosterone treatment. The experiment was repeated two times, and a representative array is shown. B, Relative changes in some TGF-β signaling pathway target genes after normalization with GAPDH intensity. C, Verification of SuperArray data by RT and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA isolated from C3H 10T1/2 cells treated with medium alone (con, black bars) or 100 nm testosterone (+T, white bars) were analyzed by RT and real-time PCR, using gene-specific primers for FKBP, BMP10, SMAD7, and FST. Three independent experiments were performed, and data shown are mean ± sem. Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t test. **, P ≤ 0.01 compared with control group.</div></div>
