From: Functions of the cytoplasmic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA-5: Key regulators of innate immunity. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Short dsRNA’s or 5’-triphosphate ssRNA’s activate RIG-I which associates with mitochondrial IPS-1 to trigger FADD/RIP1 (innateosome) controlled activation of the type I interferon genes. Longer RNA’s generated from picornaviruses trigger MDA5-mediated activation of type I IFN. The RIG-I/IPS-1 pathway also requires the assistance of STING to activate type I IFN, which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). STING may regulate the translocon composed of the TRAP complex and Sec61, which in turn may regulate exocyst-mediated stimulation of the TBK-1 pathway. STING also appears pivotal in regulating DNA-mediated triggering of type I IFN production.</div></div>
