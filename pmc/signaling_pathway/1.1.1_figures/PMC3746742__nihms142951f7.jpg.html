The PI3K/Akt (solid arrow), but not Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK (dotted arrow) pathway, mediates the EGF-induced DMR signal in UPCI-37B SCCHN cells. Our established cell-based optical signature assay is a novel approach for the discovery of inhibitors targeting the EGFR signaling pathway through HTS.</div></div>
