From: Dynamics of Brassinosteroid Response Modulated by Negative Regulator LIC in Rice. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">BZR1 is a positive transcription factor and represents an activation pathway, whereas LIC functions antagonistically as a negative transcription factor and mediates a “brake” pathway in BR signaling. Both BZR1 and LIC are phosphorylated by BIN2/GSK1 and transported to the cytoplasm in the absence of BR (green represents positive members and the activation pathway, and red represents negative members and repression pathway in BR signaling).</div></div>
