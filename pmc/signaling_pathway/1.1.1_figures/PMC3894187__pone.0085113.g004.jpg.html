(B) The increased protein levels of PI3K/Akt signaling molecules were determined by western blot in K562/ST6GAL1 cells. (C) Decreased expression of P-gp and MRP1 were examined by flow cytometry analysis in K562/ADR-ST6GAL1 shRNA cells. (D) Flow cytometry analysis revealed a higher co-expression of P-gp and MRP1 in K562 cells with ST6GAL1 transfection. The data are means Â± SD of 3 independent assays (*P&lt;0.05).</div></div>
