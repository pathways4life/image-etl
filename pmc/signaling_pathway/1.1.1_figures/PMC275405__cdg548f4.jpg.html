From: scribble mutants cooperate with oncogenic Ras or Notch to cause neoplastic overgrowth in Drosophila. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Fig. 4.</b> Ectopic activation of Ras and Notch signaling pathways, but not Wg, Dpp, Hh or PI3 kinase pathways, in scrib mutant eye clones induces massive cooperative overgrowth. (A–L) The MARCM system was used ectopically to activate the EGFR/Ras pathway (RasACT; <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>); Notch pathway (NACT; <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>); Wg pathway (ArmACT; <b>E</b> and <b>F</b>); Dpp pathway (TkvACT; <b>G</b> and <b>H</b>); Hh pathway (Ci-155; <b>I</b> and <b>J</b>); or PI3 kinase pathway (PI3K; <b>K</b> and <b>L</b>) in either wild-type control eye clones (A, C, E, G, I and K) or scrib1 clones (B, D, F, H, J and L). All clones are marked by the expression of GFP. Developing photoreceptors are shown by Elav staining (A1–L1; merged with GFP in A2–L2). The resulting adult eyes (A3–L3), or pharate adults dissected from the pupal case (C3), are shown where applicable. Expression of RasACT in control clones (A) induces precocious photoreceptor differentiation anterior to the MF (arrowhead). In scrib1 clones (B), RasACT fails to initiate differentiation, and instead, massive three-dimensional tissue overgrowth is induced, resulting in fusion of the eye/antennal discs to each other as well as the brain lobes (arrowheads). The insert (B1) shows wild-type brain lobes (arrowheads) and eye antennal discs (arrows) at the same magnification (magnification is half that of the other panels in this figure) for comparison. Expression of NACT in control clones (C) interferes with photoreceptor differentiation (arrowheads), and adult flies die before eclosure with overgrown eyes. In scrib– clones (D), NACT induces a similar degree of three-dimensional overgrowth, and lack of differentiation, as RasACT (a planar section is shown, but overgrowth is in three dimensions). Ectopic activation of Wg pathway signaling effectively blocks photoreceptor differentiation in control clones (E; arrowhead), and this remains the case in scrib1 clones (F). Ectopic activation of Dpp or Hh signaling induces patterning defects in both control clones (G and I), as well as scrib1 clones (H and J). Ectopic PI3 kinase signaling in scrib1 clones (L) has little effect.</div></div>
