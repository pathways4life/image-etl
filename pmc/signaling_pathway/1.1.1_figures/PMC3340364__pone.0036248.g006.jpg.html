Pathways targeted by deregulated miRNAs in glioblastoma stem cells..  From: Genome-Wide Profiling Identified a Set of miRNAs that Are Differentially Expressed in Glioblastoma Stem Cells and Normal Neural Stem Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Common miRNA targets were subjected to DAVID functional annotation with KEGG pathway analysis. <b>A.</b> The up-regulated miRNAs in glioblastoma stem cells were predicted to target the p53 pathway. The p53-centered pathway has been shown to regulate cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis, and genome stability. <b>B.</b> The down-regulated miRNAs were predicted to target components of the IGF pathway. Various components of the IGF signaling pathways were targeted by down-regulated miRNAs. The IGF pathway has been shown to enhance cell growth, survival, and migration.</div></div>
