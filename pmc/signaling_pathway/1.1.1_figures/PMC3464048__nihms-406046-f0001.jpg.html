Dysregulated survival pathways in large granular lymphocyte leukemia.  From: Large granular lymphocyte leukemia: from dysregulated pathways to therapeutic targets. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The intact Fas–FasL-mediated apoptosis pathway is shown. Elevated levels of the soluble form of Fas or FasL contribute to apoptotic resistance in leukemic LGLs by acting as receptor or ligand decoys. MMP inhibitors are proposed for therapeutic intervention. Other contributing signaling pathways that are essential in LGL leukemia pathogenesis include the signals that are mediated by IL-15, PDGF and NF-κB. IL-15 promotes LGL survival either by activating the JAK–STAT3 signaling pathway to upregulate gene expression of antiapoptotic factor or by targeting Bid to the proteasome for degradation. IL-15 signaling can be inhibited by a Mikβ1 monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-15R. PDGF functions through PI3K–Akt and Ras–MEK1–ERK signaling cascades, leading to cell proliferation and growth. PDGF signaling can be inhibited by RTK inhibitors such as imatinib. PI3K–Akt signaling can be blocked by using pan-PI3K inhibitors. Ras–MEK1–ERK signaling can be targeted using farnesyltransferase inhibitors to prevent farnesylation of Ras or by using MEK1 inhibitors such as PD98059 and U0216. NF-κB complex upregulates the transcription of survival genes resulting in survival of leukemic LGLs. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, can be used to prevent NF-κB signaling. FasL: Fas ligand; IκB: Inhibitor of NF-κB; IKK: IκB kinase; IL-15R: IL-15 receptor; LGL: Large granular lymphocyte; MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase; RTK: Receptor tyrosine kinase.</div></div>
