Expression sites of Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> components in the E14.5 mouse kidney..  From: A High-Resolution Anatomical Atlas of the Transcriptome in the Mouse Embryo. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) The matrix shows the level of expression of all 58 regionally expressed genes in ten different renal structures that are defined in (B). Colors represent expression strength: strong (red), moderate (light red), weak (pink), and not detected (white). The Wnt signaling components are grouped into seven blocks (ligands, receptors, extracellular inhibitors, canonical signaling, Ca2+ signaling, PCP signaling, and GO Wnt receptor signaling pathway). (B) The scheme in the center illustrates the ten main anatomical structures characterizing the developing kidney. The image gallery composed of low- and high-power (inset) images reveals that each of the ten structures characteristically expresses a particular Wnt component. 1: Wnt7b; 2: Wnt11; 3: Dkk1; 4: Sfrp2; 5: Lrp6; 6: Slc9a3r1; 7: Tle4; 8: Tcf4; 9: Wnt5a; 10: Rspo3. (C) Wnt signaling components involved in the mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition. Wnt9b is expressed in the ureteric bud (white arrowhead) and acts upstream of WNT4, which is expressed in condensing mesenchyme (black arrowhead). The Wnt receptors FZD3 (black arrowhead) and FZD4 (black arrowhead) are expressed in a way that allows them to function as candidate transducers for WNT9B/WNT4 signaling and could possibly underlie a shift from canonical to noncanonical signaling.</div></div>
