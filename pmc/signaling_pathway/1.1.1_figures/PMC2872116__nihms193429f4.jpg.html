From: Visual integration of quantitative proteomic data, pathways and protein interactions. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proteins and interactions from HPRD (small fonts) that are connected to the canonical pathway model are: (left) integrated directly into the signaling pathway image with one protein selected and its interactions highlighted; (right) structured around a user-constructed model; different classes of proteins have different appearances: experimental proteins are colored yellow, kinases are drawn as hexagons and receptors as irregular stars; several experimental proteins are not known to be connected to the pathway and are therefore located in the lower right corner. HPRD proteins are placed in a structured manner between the pathway proteins based on their separation from the pathway proteins. (cutout) Disadvantage of simply drawing the network on top of the pathway image: HPRD interactions obscure elements of the canonical pathway; compare to the improved method (left) in which important pathway elements remain in the foreground.</div></div>
