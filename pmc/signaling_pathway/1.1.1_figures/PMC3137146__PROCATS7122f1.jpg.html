From: Autophagy in Innate and Adaptive Immunity. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of LPS-induced signaling pathway for autophagy as predicted from our recent data (6) and from recent studies. LPSs induce autophagy by stimulation of the TLR4-TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-Î² (TRIF)-receptor interacting protein (RIP) 11 pathway. The signaling components directly downstream of RIP still need to be identified. Nevertheless, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is required for LPS-induced autophagy and for survival. This pathway seems to be in contrast to the c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated autophagic pathway previously described (25). Reproduced by permission from Reference 23.</div></div>
