The basic components of the TGF-β signaling pathway shown in Figure 1 are used here as a background to illustrate the phenotypic differences observed from manipulating the specific components in wound-healing studies. See text sections Manipulation of TGF-β signaling in wound healing using exogenously added molecules and Genetic manipulation of TGF-β signaling in wound healing for a detailed account of the signaling components manipulated and the specific effects on the wound-healing outcome.
