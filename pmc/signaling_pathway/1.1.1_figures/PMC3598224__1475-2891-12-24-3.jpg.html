Legend:</b> Gene expression differences (≥ ± 1.2 fold change) in canonical pathways comparing high and low scores for the Prudent dietary pattern <b>(A)</b> For the men <b>(B)</b> For the women. P-values for Functional Analysis of dataset by IPA (Fisher’s Exact Test) are presented. % of genes significantly up-regulated and down-regulated in each canonical pathway are presented (number of genes differently expressed/number of genes in the pathways*100). <b>(A)</b> PDGF Signaling: P = 0.004, 14 genes significantly different; ERK/MAPK Signaling: P = 0.004, 29 genes significantly different; FcyRIIB Signaling in B Lymphocytes: P = 0.003, 10 genes significantly different; B Cell Receptor Signaling: P = 0.002, 24 genes significantly different; CTLA4 Signaling in Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes: P = 0.003, 17 genes significantly different; PI3K Signaling in B Lymphocytes: P = 0.0009, 23 genes significantly different; Leucocyte Extravasation Signaling: P = 0.0002, 32 genes significantly different. <b>(B)</b> Signaling by Rho Family GTPase: P = 0.02, 20 genes significantly different; B Cell Receptor Signaling: P = 0.02, 14 genes significantly different; Role of NFAT in Regulation of the Immune Response: P = 0.01, 16 genes significantly different; RhoGDI Signaling: P = 0.009, 17 genes significantly different; Cyclins and Cell Cycle Regulation: P = 0.007, 10 genes significantly different; Breast Cancer Regulation by Stathmin1: P = 0.0005, 22 genes significantly different; B Cell Development: P = 0.0004, 7 genes significantly different.</div></div>
