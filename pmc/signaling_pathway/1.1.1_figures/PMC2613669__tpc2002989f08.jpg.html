Expression of AM11 is induced early and relies on an intact SYM pathway. Induction of systemically (S; gray arrows) induced genes, AM3 and AM34, and the late (L; black arrows) induced gene, AM14, relies on an intact Ca2+ response and thus requires CASTOR, POLLUX, and CCAMK but is independent of CYCLOPS. Expression of PT11 is dependent on arbuscule formation. The dependence of AM10 and AM15 on SYM pathway signaling or on arbuscule formation is not known (dashed arrows with question marks). AM1 and AM2 are induced early but do not require functional CASTOR, POLLUX, CCAMK, or CYCLOPS, demonstrating the existence of an alternative AM signaling pathway (AP).</div></div>
