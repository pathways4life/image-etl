From: The role of Axin2 in calvarial morphogenesis and craniosynostosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Activation of β -catenin and LEF/TCF signaling in skull development. Mice carrying the TOPGAL transgene, capable of responding to β -catenin and LEF/TCF signaling, were used to monitor activation of this pathway by β -gal staining analyses in cranial skulls at E16.5 (C,E) and P1 (D,F). Whole-mount staining shows activation of the canonical Wnt pathway during early skull formation (C–F). Arrowheads indicate the coronal sutures and arrows indicate the activation of β -catenin and LEF/TCF signaling in medial parts of the nasal bones. The non-transgenic mice, with no background staining, indicate the specificity of the assay (A,B). Scale bars: 2 mm in A–D; 500 μ m in E,F.</div></div>
