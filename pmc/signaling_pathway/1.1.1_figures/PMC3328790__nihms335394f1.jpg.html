The canonical TGFβ pathway involves SMADs. The non-canonical TGFβ pathways include several SMAD-independent signaling cascades such as calcium-calcineurin and MAPK pathways. The Ang II pathway can interact with TGFβ signaling through both SMAD-dependent and SMAD-independent pathways (see text for details).</div></div>
