From: Bile acids as regulatory molecules. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism and cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways by bile acids. Bile acids regulate glucose metabolism in hepatocytes by activating the insulin signaling pathway and by induction of the gene encoding SHP. Conjugated bile acids activate the insulin signaling pathway (pAKT) via surface G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which activates glycogen synthase activity and inhibits gluconeogenesis by phosphorylation of FOX01. SHP is known to interact with FOX01, a transcription factor known to upregulate gluconeogenic genes. Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1), a kinase in the insulin signaling pathway, is known to phosphorylate and activate protein kinase Cζ (PCKζ). PKCζ is proposed to phosphorylate FXR, enhancing the ability of conjugated bile acids to induce the gene encoding SHP. SHP can also downregulate the gene encoding SREBP1-c, which controls the rate of FA synthesis. Bile acids can activate JNK 1/2 in hepatocyte cultures by stimulating ceramide synthesis. In vivo, bile acids can activate the JNK 1/2 pathway by stimulating the synthesis of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 (FGF-15/19) in the intestines. Finally, TNF-α and IL-1 can also activate the JNK 1/2 pathway downregulating CYP7A1. Bold lines indicate pathways activated by bile acids.</div></div>
