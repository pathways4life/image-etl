From: Ameliorating prefrontal cortical dysfunction in mental illness: inhibition of phosphotidyl inositol-protein kinase C <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">High levels of phosphotidyl inositol-protein kinase C signaling in the PFC markedly impair PFC function at the behavioral and cellular levels. Molecules that normally serve as brakes on this pathway and are highly associated with genetic/biochemical alteration in mental illness are indicated in gray. Patients with these genetic changes would have weaker regulation of phosphotidyl inositol-protein kinase C signaling. Many treatments for mental illness inhibit this signaling pathway through either extracellular or intracellular actions; these treatments are indicated in italics. Tamoxifen is a proof of concept (p.o.c.) treatment; prazosin is used to treat PTSD but not schizophrenia or bipolar disorder; chelerythrine is undergoing pre-clinical safety testing</div></div>
