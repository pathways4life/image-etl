From: Rsu1 contributes to regulation of cell adhesion and spreading by PINCH1-dependent and - independent mechanisms. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Rsu1 is a critical component for regulation of p38 Map kinase signaling from the IPP complex. Rsu1 is required for the constitutive and EGF-induced p38 signaling. The elimination of Rsu1 reduces both constitutive and EGF-induced p38 phosphorylation and the expression of N92D-Rsu1 activates constitutive p38 signaling. p38 Map kinase can be activated by detachment and this may occur via the Î±Pix-induced Rac pathway. Dashed and dotted lines represent incompletely characterized pathways</div></div>
