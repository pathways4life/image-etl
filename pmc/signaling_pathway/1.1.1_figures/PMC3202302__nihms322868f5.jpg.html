In the case of BAFF-R, direct binding of TRAF3 initiates a cascade resulting in release of NIK and downstream activation of non-canonical NFκB. In this regard, recruitment of a complex containing TRAF3- TRAF2-cIAP1/2-NIK leads to TRAF3 degradation via TRAF2-activated cIAP1/2. Alternatively, NIK can be released from the TRAF3-TRAF2-cIAP1/2-NIK complex via displacement of cAP1/2 and NIK from TRAF2 and TRAF3 which are then degraded. NIK then functions to activate IKK2 resulting in non-canonical NFκB signaling. Upon CD40L engagement of CD40, TRAF2 activation of cIAP can not only lead to activation of NIK but also of MEKK, promoting downstream MAPK signaling. In addition, TRAF6 recruitment results in the activation of the TAB1-TAK complex, which is also responsible for activation of the canonical NFκB pathway.</div></div>
