Pumping rates increased for first 2 hr in the absence of food. Two mutants defective in muscarinic signaling showed altered pumping rates compared to wild-type. gpb-2 mutants, which have upregulated muscarinic signaling, showed a higher pumping rate, and gar-3 mutants, which have downregulated muscarinic signaling, showed a lower pumping rate than wild-type.<b>B)</b> A suggested pathway for function of the muscarinic receptor â†’ MAPK pathway in starvation.</div></div>
