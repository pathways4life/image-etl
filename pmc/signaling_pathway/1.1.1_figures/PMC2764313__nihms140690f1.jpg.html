The paradox of INS/IGF activity: high activity promotes growth but limits longevity.<b>B</b>. Signaling is regulated by phosphorylation (yellow symbols) through a highly conserved pathway, which is shown here for mammalian IGF-1. Receptor activation by ligand binding generates PIP3 and can be blocked by PTEN. AKT phosphorylation turns on a growth pathway that acts through mTOR and is blocked by 4E-BP (not shown) and turns off FOXO activity in the nucleus, which otherwise causes cell cycle arrest.</div></div>
