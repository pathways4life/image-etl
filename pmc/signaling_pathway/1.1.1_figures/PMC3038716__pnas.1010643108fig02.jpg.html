The Notch pathway was adapted from KEGG (42) by adding Notch interactors from the literature to create an expanded Notch signaling pathway. Genes differentially expressed in larva (expression levels from Zhou et al.) (1) are cyan (up-regulated) or yellow (down-regulated), genes showing no change in expression are gray, and untested genes are white. Genes for which one more SNP and/or indels became fixed are indicated with stars: red for genes located within a hypoxia-selected region and blue for all others.</div></div>
