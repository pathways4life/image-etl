From: Adipokines Mediate Inflammation and Insulin Resistance. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Inflammatory adipokines suppress insulin signaling resulting in insulin resistance</b>. IRS1/2 phosphorylated on specific tyrosine residues activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway and Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. PI3K-AKT signaling pathway regulates metabolic processes such as glucose uptake (muscle and adipocytes), glycogen synthesis (muscle and liver), protein synthesis (muscle and liver), and gluconeogenesis (liver). Inflammatory signals, TNF-Î±, IL-6, LPS, and saturated free fatty acid, activate inhibitory molecules such as SOCS and JNK to suppress insulin signaling resulting in insulin resistance. PI3K dependent PDK1 activation is negatively regulated by phospholipid phosphatases such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) that degrade PIP3.</div></div>
