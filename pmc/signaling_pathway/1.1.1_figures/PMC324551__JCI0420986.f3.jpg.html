From: Central role of the P2Y12 receptor in platelet activation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Intracellular signaling events downstream of the P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors. ADP binds to the P2Y12 receptor and causes a number of intracellular signaling events downstream of the Gi pathway that contribute to fibrinogen receptor activation and platelet aggregation. The P2Y12 receptorâ€“mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase is not directly responsible for fibrinogen receptor activation. Potassium channels and PI3K are also activated by the P2Y12 receptor. Both Rap1b and Akt are signaling mediators that contribute to platelet aggregation and are activated in a PI3K-dependent manner. Other mediators of P2Y12 signaling remain to be elucidated.</div></div>
