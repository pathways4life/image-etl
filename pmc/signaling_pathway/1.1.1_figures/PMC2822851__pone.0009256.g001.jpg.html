Entrez official gene symbols are used for protein names. (B) Example of how a relation between two groups (functional classes) is formed in the Atlas of Signaling. (C) Same pathway as in (A) built with ontological groups: functional classes (orange hexagons) and cell process “actin-based cytoskeleton assembly” (yellow rectangle). The description of relationships between entities on the pathways is provided in the legend to Table 2.</div></div>
