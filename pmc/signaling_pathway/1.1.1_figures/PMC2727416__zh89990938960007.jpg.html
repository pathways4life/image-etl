The alternative survival and proliferation pathway triggered by higher concentrations of GM-CSF is dependent on the dodecamer assembly and involves the Jak/STAT, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and PI-3 kinase pathways (right). The key receptor-proximal events that initiate these signaling pathways are the mutually exclusive phosphorylation of Ser585 and of Tyr577 of Î²c.</div></div>
