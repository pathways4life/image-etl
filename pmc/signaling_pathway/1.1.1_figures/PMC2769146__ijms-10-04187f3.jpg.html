From: Functional Analysis of Familial Asp67Glu and Thr1051Ser BRCA1 Mutations in Breast/Ovarian Carcinogenesis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The role of BRCA1 missense mutation, Asp67Glu and Thr1051Serine, to estrogen receptor signaling pathway. Wt.BRCA1 expression vector and mutant BRCA1 expression vectors were transfected into DU145 cell line for 48 hrs. Cells were stimulated by estrogen and assay for pERE-Elb-Luc reporter activity. The luciferase activity of BRCA1 mutants were different from activity of the wild-type (P &lt; 0.05). These missense mutations failed to promote the estrogen receptor signaling pathway for breast/ovarian carcinogenesis.</div></div>
