B, Hepa1c1c7 cells were transfected with siRNAs against Rictor or scrambled siRNA for 36 h and were then treated with leucine or insulin alone or insulin plus leucine for 30 min, followed by evaluations of phosphorylated Akt (at serine 473), total Akt, total Rictor, and β-actin by using immunoblotting with specific antibodies. C, Hepa1c1c7 cell were transfected with siRNAs against Raptor or scrambled (Scr) siRNA for 36 h and were then treated with leucine (0.6 mm) or insulin (10 nm) alone or insulin plus leucine for 30 min, followed by evaluations of phosphorylated Akt (at serine 473), total Akt, total Raptor, and β-actin by using immunoblotting. Results were presented as the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments, each in duplicate. Bars not sharing a letter are statistically different (p &lt; 0.05).</div></div>
