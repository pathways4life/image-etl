FcεRI engagement results in phosphorylation of receptor ITAMs by Lyn and Fyn, thus generating docking sites for theses proteins as well as for Syk. Binding to ITAMs results in the upregulation of Fyn, Lyn and Syk kinase activity and causes phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules. As a consequence of these events multi-protein complexes containing various signaling molecules are formed that the induce activation of MAPK pathways and the generation of second messenger molecules, leading to the induction of cell activation. Sphks - sphingosine kinases.</div></div>
