From: Role of Caspase 2 in Apoptotic <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Primate and Murine Germ Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Summary of caspase 2-mediated signaling cascades in heat-induced germ cell apoptosis. Activation of caspase 2 after heat stress results in activation of MAPK14 and NOS2 induction. It is likely that activation of such signaling cascade perturbs the BAX/BCL2 rheostat in the mitochondria [8, 10, 11] and triggers the cytochrome c (Cyt.c)-mediated death pathway. Caspase 2-mediated signaling could also activate heat-induced germ cell apoptosis by targeting mitochondria directly, possibly through a decline in cellular metabolism (dotted line).</div></div>
