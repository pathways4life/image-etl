Hypothetical depiction of three GSK pools and their possible involvement in regulation of diverse <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways.  From: GSK3: a multifaceted kinase in Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Three pools of GSK3 are hypothesized to exist. One pool is associated with AXIN and probably regulated by LRP5/6. Another pool is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser9 or Ser-27 by the PI3K-AKT pathway. Additionally, there might be an AXIN-independent pool of GSK3, which is also regulated by Wnt. However, the mechanisms by which this pool would be regulated are not clear.</div></div>
