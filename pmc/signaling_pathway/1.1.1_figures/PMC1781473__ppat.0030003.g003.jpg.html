This simplified representation shows the different levels at which T3SS effectors (black-boxes) thus far have been shown to interfere with the pro-inflammatory host immune response; this interference can be at the signaling node represented by the TAK1 complex (affecting both NF-κB and the MAPK signaling pathways), or downstream of TAK1, only affecting the NF-κB pathway. Numbers in brackets indicate the specific references. Details of the immune signaling are given in the text.</div></div>
