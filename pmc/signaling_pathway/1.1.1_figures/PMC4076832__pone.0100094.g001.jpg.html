Protein-Protein interaction network (PPi) and Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) are compiled using Cytoscape software and its plugins. Also, signaling pathway reconstruction is accomplished in CellDesigner software based on biological knowledge accumulated in related literatures and public databases (e.g. Gene Ontology, Uniprot, and NCBI geneRIFs) and related signaling pathways deposited in the signaling pathway databases such as Biocarta, Reactome, and NCI-PID. The final mustard signaling pathway was drawn manually using CellDesigner.</div></div>
