A separate table summarizes affected pathways. Submitted genes or proteins are marked along metabolic or signaling pathway maps. For example, Lmo1986 and Lmo2006, two enzymes out of seventeen that are annotated within the ‘Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis’ pathway were found to be co-regulated and mediate the first steps of this synthesis (see partial view of the corresponding map).</div></div>
