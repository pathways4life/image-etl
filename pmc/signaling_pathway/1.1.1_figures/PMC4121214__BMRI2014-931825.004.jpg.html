From: Integrated Analysis Identifies Interaction Patterns between Small Molecules and Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Hierarchical clustering in the M-P link map for breast cancer from GSE5364. (a) Hierarchical clustering between 571 small molecules and 47 metabolic pathways. The corresponding cells are coloured red, where small molecules link to the pathways in the M-P link map. The labels for the corresponding pathways are shown on the right of the figure. (b) Zoomed-in plot of an sM-sP link between LY-294002 and the VEGF signaling pathway. The gene indicated by the arrow is the drug target of LY-294002. Differentially expressed genes in this pathway are coloured pink, while other genes in green are human disease-related genes. (c) Zoomed-in plot of mM-sP links between eight small molecules and the Wnt signaling pathway. These eight small molecules target only the Wnt signaling pathway. The differentially expressed genes in this pathway are coloured pink, while other genes in green are human disease-related genes.</div></div>
