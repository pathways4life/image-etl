The pathway reaction map contains 37 proteins involved in 9 molecular associations, 21 enzyme catalysis reactions and 7 translocation events. Apart from the reactions selected based on NetSlim criteria, we have also included 2 enzyme complexes namely MTORC1 and PI3-kinase complex based on the inhibitor assays that confirmed their role in TSLP signaling and our phosphoproteomics study (the nodes highlighted in green). The edges representing the relationships between nodes are explained in the legend.</div></div>
