The TCR-antigen•MHC complex interaction and the co-stimulatory signal results in an immediate early pro-oxidant response in DCs with ROS production e.g. by lipoxygenase and NADPH oxidase. Low levels of ROS act as signaling molecules to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and activate protein kinases. ROS also activates the NF-κB pathway, which stimulates the expression of γ-glutamylcysteine ligase, thus increasing GSH synthesis. GSH activates the AP1 signaling pathway and initiates an antioxidant response. We postulate that system xc--dependent cystine uptake, GSH export and degradation into extracellular cysteine are stimulated as part of this response. (B) TCR signaling in T cells. Stimulation of T cells by DCs via the TCR results in phosphorylation and activation of ZAP-70 by leukocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK). ZAP-70 directly phosphorylates the adaptor protein LAT and causes the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes. Recruitment of the growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (GRB2) and phospholipase C γ1 (PLCγ1) to LAT leads to activation of downstream Ras and calcium signaling pathways.</div></div>
