Activated ERN1/IRE1 induces the TRAF2-MAPK8 pathway, inducing autophagy independent of XBP1. PERK activation and phosphorylation of EIF2S1/eIF2Î±, leads to upregulation of ATG12 possibly through the transcriptional activity of ATF4. XBP1 negatively regulates the levels of FOXO1, inducing its degradation by the proteasome. Then, inactivation of XBP1 protects against HD due to increased accumulation of FOXO1 and the upregulation of its target genes, which include many autophagy regulators. Signaling events related with aging (i.e., insulin and IGF1 signaling) may intersect in FOXO1 and XBP1 to modulate autophagy levels in HD.</div></div>
