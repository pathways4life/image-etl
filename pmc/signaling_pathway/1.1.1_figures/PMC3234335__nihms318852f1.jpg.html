Model for the stimulation of hepcidin expression in hepatocytes by inflammation and by iron levels in the body.  From: Hereditary Hemochromatosis and Transferrin Receptor 2. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Elevation of interleukin 6 (IL6) during inflammation stimulates hepcidin transcription through binding to the IL6-receptor (IL6R)-gp130 complex, which stimulates signaling through the phosphorylation of JAK leading to the phosphorylation of STAT3. The phosphorylated STAT3 dimer binds to two identified BMP responsive elements in the promoter region of hepcidin stimulating transcription. Elevation of iron levels in the body leads to the upregulation of BMP6 and Tf-saturation. BMP6 signals through binding to hemojuvelin (HJV), BMP receptors and neogenin (Neo) and signals through the SMAD4/SMAD1/5/8 pathway to stimulate hepcidin expression. Two BMP responsive elements in the promoter region of hepcidin have been identified. Less is known about the Tf-TfR2-HFE signaling pathway (see text). Mutations in HFE result in a blunted pSMAD response. The p38 MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway is proposed to mediate this response.</div></div>
