Without its normal binding partner p52, RelB will bind p50 to form RelB:p50 dimers, which accumulate in the nucleus. As a result, constitutive RelB:p50 activity compensates for the loss of inducible RelB:p52 activity. <b>(B)</b> The NFκB signaling system in nfκb1−/− cells. Without its normal binding partner p50, RelA will bind p52 causing an increase in constitutive p100 processing and thus a depletion of the IκBδ and p100 pool, which is required for RelB:p52 activation. Though the canonical pathway is largely preserved in nfκb1−/− cells, compensation by p52 weakens the non-canonical pathway.</div></div>
