From: Kinase/phosphatase overexpression reveals pathways regulating hippocampal neuron morphology. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Neural process development is affected by known pathways, including cancer pathways. Pathway annotations from the KEGG grouped genes into 79 pathways. (<b>A</b>) KEGG categories. (<b>B</b>) KEGG pathway names. (<b>C</b>) Heat map for pathway's effect on neurite average length as indicated by color (red, decrease; white, no change from control; green, increase). (<b>D</b>) The 24 pathway subcategories, with heat map representing average effects of all genes in the category. (<b>E</b>) Names of pathway subcategories. (<b>F</b>) Legend for heat map. Symbols atop the heat map indicated significance from non-parametric statistics, where diamond is P⩽0.05 by spiked bootstrap, and square is P⩽0.05 by bootstrap. (<b>G</b>) After the analysis was repeated for four of the other parameters, the most significant pathways were compiled. They included three cancer pathways, the closely related ErbB signaling pathway, and dorsal-ventral axis formation pathway. Source data are available for this figure at www.nature.com/msb.</div></div>
