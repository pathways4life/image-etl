UNC-6/Netrin signaling from the ventral nerve cord polarizes UNC-40/DCC ventrally (white arrowheads) towards the basement membrane and vulval tissue. In turn the Netrin signaling recruits cytoplasmic signaling effectors such as the MIG-2/Mtl Rac. Through this signaling pathway, the actin cytoskeleton is oriented towards the basement membrane for invasion. In unc-6 mutants, polarity of UNC-40/DCC is lost and F-actin and MIG-2/Mtl Rac can accumulate on apical and lateral membranes (yellow arrowheads). Scale bar at bottom left is 5Î¼m. <b>(b)</b> In one possible model for UNC-6/Netrin signaling through UNC-40/DCC receptors to polarize a cell, binding of the UNC-40/DCC to UNC-6/Netrin on neighboring cells or basement membranes concentrates the receptor. This leads to local recruitment and activation of the Rac-like proteins MIG-2/Mtl Rac and/or CED-10/Rac, perhaps by UNC-73/Trio, which can bind to the intracellular domains of UNC-40/DCC, Frazzled/DCC and Human DCC. Downstream of Rac activation the pathway may diverge, utilizing context specific regulators and effectors such as MIG-10/Lamellipodin, a known Rac effector and cytoskeletal regulator.</div></div>
