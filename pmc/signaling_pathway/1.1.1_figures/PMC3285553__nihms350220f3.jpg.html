From: Dysregulation of Wnt/?-catenin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Gastrointestinal Cancers. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Additional mechanisms by which Wnt/β-catenin signaling can be modulated in cancer. (A) In hepatocytes, β-catenin can be released from an additional membrane bound pool associated with the receptor C-MET. When engaged by HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), C-MET releases β-catenin into the cytoplasm with its eventual translocation into the nucleus. (B) Membrane-bound NOTCH1 can bind activated β-catenin and cause its lysosomal destruction, thereby inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. A decrease in NOTCH1 expression may therefore potentiate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in certain types of cancer. (C) Interactions with numerous proteins can modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling at various levels in the pathway. SULF-1 (Sulfatase-1) can increase the efficiency of Wnt ligands by modulating their interactions with heparin sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular environment. ATDC (Ataxia telangiectasia group D-complementing) protein can potentiate pathway activation through its interaction with DVL (Dishevelled). SMO (Smoothened) can increase Wnt/β-catenin signaling by an unknown mechanism. Undoubtedly, novel mechanisms will be uncovered to explain the complex context dependency of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</div></div>
