The core kinase module of the Hpo pathway regulates multiple outputs, including tissue growth, neuronal homeostasis and autophagy. Hpo-dependent tissue growth is mediated through inhibition of Yki by a phosphorylation-dependent and independent mechanisms. The neuroprotective effect of Hpo signaling also required Yki inhibition, independent of its phosphorylation by Wts. In contrast, Yki is not involved in Hpo-dependent autophagy. The core kinase complex is regulated by multiple inputs, including Fat and Ex. The interplay between Hpo signaling activity and F-actin dynamics may be a general requirement in Hpo signaling.</div></div>
