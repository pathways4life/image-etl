Cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% serum without leucine for 2 h before addition of LPA and/or PA. A: ERK1/2 phosphorylation on Thr202/Tyr204 was measured by Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of the protein. B: S6K1 phosphorylation was assessed as described in Fig. 3 legend. Values are means ± SE of 3 experiments; in each experiment, 3 samples per condition were independently analyzed. Representative blots are shown. *P &lt; 0.0005 vs. cells incubated in medium containing 0.5% serum without leucine. †P &lt; 0.02; #P &lt; 0.04 vs. PA alone.</div></div>
