The number of genes mapping to each significant region are included in brackets and regions enriched in SHH are shaded red. <b>b, c,</b> Recurrent amplifications of PPM1D (<b>b</b>) and PIK3C2B/MDM4 (<b>c</b>) are restricted to SHH. <b>d,</b> FISH validation of MDM4 amplification. <b>e,</b> SHH signaling, TP53 signaling, and RTK/PI3K signaling represent the core pathways genomically targeted in SHH. P-values indicate the prevalence with which the respective pathway is targeted in SHH vs. non-SHH cases (Fisherâ€™s exact test). Frequencies of focal and broad (parentheses) SCNAs are listed. <b>f,</b> Mutual exclusivity analysis of focal SCNAs in SHH. <b>g,</b> Clinical implications of SCNAs affecting MYCN, GLI2, or PTCH1 in SHH (log-rank tests).</div></div>
