(A) Western blot analysis revealed that Kremen1 was down-regulated in Cardiogenol C-treated HBPCs. Tubulin served as an internal control. (B) Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed Dkk1 and Kremen1, which are normally involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, were down-regulated in Cardiogenol C-treated HBPCs while Lef1 and Wnt11 expression were up-regulated.</div></div>
