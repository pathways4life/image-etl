From: Simvastatin Inhibits Airway Hyperreactivity. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The mevalonate (MA) pathway: sterol and nonsterol products. Simvastatin and other statins directly inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase to prevent conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. The MA pathway leads to sterol and nonsterol products, that is, cholesterol and the isoprenoids farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), respectively. Isoprenylation describes the formation of covalent bonds between FPP and Ras, and/or between GGPP and RhoA via enzymes farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase, respectively. This then allows inactive cytosolic small G proteins Ras and RhoA to attach to the cell membrane as the active form, to transduce signaling cascades. Adapted from Takeda and colleagues (38). FTase = farnesyltransferase; GGTase = geranylgeranyltransferase.</div></div>
