Signal pathways of the SMAD3-bound target genes..  From: High Throughput Determination of TGF?1/SMAD3 Targets in A549 Lung Epithelial Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A: ChIP SMAD3-bound target genes grouped by signaling pathway and ranked in order of statistical significance. The ratio of genes (orange line) refers to number of genes involved in pathway divided by total genes; approximately 10% of bound genes are identified as belonging to the known TGFβ1 signaling pathway. Other prominent signaling pathways include ERK/MAPK and integrin signaling, which is consistent with known interactions of TGFβ1. Data and image generated using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. B: Combined gene expression microarray and ChIP-on-chip data grouped by biological process using MetaCore GeneGo systems biology analysis tools [46], [47]. The top 10 identified pathways are shown. The solid blue and orange bars represent the -log (p-value) for unique genes identified by the TGFβ1-induced gene expression and the ChIP SMAD3-bound genes, respectively. The stripped blue bars represent the -log (p-value) for common genes identified by both TGFβ1-induced gene expression and ChIP SMAD3-bound genes. The black bars represent the -log (p-value) for similar genes identified by both TGFβ1-induced gene expression and ChIP SMAD3-bound genes.</div></div>
