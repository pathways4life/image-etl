From: The Caenorhabditis elegans SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-2 participates in signal transduction during oogenesis  and vulval development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">â€ƒGenetic models for ptp-2 signaling during (A) oogenesis and (B) vulval development. C. elegans genes are in italics, and their mammalian homologs are listed to the right. During oogenesis, PTP-2 likely functions to regulate positively signaling downstream from a yet uncharacterized PTK or R-PTK. PTP-2 may lead directly to the activation of the Ras, MEK, and MAPK cascade, or to the activation of an uncharacterized signaling pathway that is required for proper oogenesis. During vulval development, PTP-2 appears to be acting as a positive regulator of LET-23 signaling, functioning downstream of or in parallel to LET-60 Ras, and in a pathway that cooperates with SEM-5. All genes known to participate in the regulation of vulval induction are not shown, and this model does not intend to imply that ptp-2 does not interact with these genes, but rather that such putative relationships are yet to be defined.</div></div>
