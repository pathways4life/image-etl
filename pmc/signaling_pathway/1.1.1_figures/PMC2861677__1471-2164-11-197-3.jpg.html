There is a positive correlation between OXPHOS and TCA ('citrate') cycle <b>(A) </b>and between the KEGG pathways of OXPHOS and proteasome <b>(B)</b>. OXPHOS and MAPK signaling pathways are negatively correlated <b>(C)</b>, while signaling pathways (e.g. JAK-STAT and MAPK) are positively correlated to each other <b>(D)</b>. Plots represent net direction of regulation of a KEGG pathway, i.e. number of up- minus down-regulated genes in relation to the total number of regulated genes within a study. Correlation plots include all 64 animal and human myocardial microarray studies listed in Additional File 2.</div></div>
