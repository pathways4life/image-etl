(A) Full-length (CR-1 WT) and GPI-anchor signal sequence deletion mutant (CR-1 ΔC) of human Cripto-1 in a 3×FLAG expression vector. (B) SuperTOPFLASH luciferase assay in 293T cells transiently transfected with different concentrations of 3×FLAG-CR-1 WT or 3×FLAG-CR-1 ΔC (10 and 100 ng) together with 50 ng of SuperTOPFLASH luciferase vector. Cells were subsequently treated with 50 ng/ml of rhWnt3a protein for 16-20 hr. These results are the mean ±SD of triplicates from one of three separate experiments.</div></div>
