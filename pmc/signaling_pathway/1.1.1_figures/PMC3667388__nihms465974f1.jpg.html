Regulation of TLR7/9 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> by pDC surface receptors.  From: Regulation of TLR7/9 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PDCs express ITAM-associating or ITIM-containing receptors that play an important role in the TLR7/9-induced responses. Upon ligands engagement, TLR7/9 are activated and lead to IFNα secretion. Activation of the ITAM-associating receptors including FcεR1α, ILT7, BDCA2, NKp44 and Siglec-H negatively regulates TLR7/9 signaling pathway, except pDC-TREM that is induced by IFNα and enhances TLR7/9 signaling. CD2AP and SHIP1 are essential components and are required for ITAM signaling pathways. In contrast, activation of ITIM-containing receptors like Ly49Q and CD300a positively regulate TLR7/9 signaling pathway.</div></div>
