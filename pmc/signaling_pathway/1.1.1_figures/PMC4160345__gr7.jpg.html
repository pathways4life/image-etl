From: Differential Apicobasal VEGF <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> at Vascular Blood-Neural Barriers. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of VEGF Action on MVECs of Blood-Neural BarriersThe majority of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 is found on the apical (luminal) and basal (abluminal) side, respectively, of brain or retinal MVECs. Based on computer simulation (Mac Gabhann and Popel, 2007), such a receptor distribution is predicted to result primarily in VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 homodimers at the apical and basal surface, respectively. Residual apical VEGFR2 or basal VEGFR1 would not be found in homodimers but rather in heterodimers with the more abundant receptor. Signaling from VEGFR1, mainly triggered by circulating VEGF, activates a PI3K/Akt pathway, which plays a role in endothelial cytoprotection. Signaling from VEGFR2, triggered by tissue-borne VEGF, activates p38 and mediates paracellular permeability, hallmarked by macromolecular flux, electrical conductance, and a loss of Cldn5.</div></div>
