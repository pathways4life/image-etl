From: The Drosophila melanogaster host model. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Drosophila signaling pathways that regulate humoral responses. The Toll pathway regulates the expression of genes in response to the detection of Gram-positive type PPG or fungal Î²-1-3-glucans or activation by some fungal and bacterial proteases. The Imd pathway regulates the expression of genes in response to the detection of Gram-negative type PPG. The JAK/STAT pathway regulates the expression of genes in response to Upd3 signaling by plasmatocytes. Mammalian homologs of pathway components are shown in blue. Negative regulators of the pathways are not shown.</div></div>
