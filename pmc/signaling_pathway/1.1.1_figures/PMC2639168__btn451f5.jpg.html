(<b>A</b>) The core TGF-β pathway members, as rendered from KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), that were significantly regulated by PNF1 over at least one timepoint (1–48 h). Shaded gene products represent PNF1-stimulated genes; gene products not shaded (white) were not significantly regulated by the drug but are required for signaling between PNF1-regulated genes. (<b>B</b>) Plots of the fold changes over time for the individual gene products in the TGF-β pathway that were significantly differentially expressed after PNF1 stimulation.</div></div>
