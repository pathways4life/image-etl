Inflammatory stimuli, generally associated with pathogen responses, also boost developmental responses via signaling crosstalk within the NF-κB signaling system (black arrow). <b>(B)</b> A schematic representing a cancer cell with a cell-autonomous defect (red cross) that results in an elevated IKK activity. Such heightened IKK activity degrades theee canonical IκB isoforms, but IκBδ, whose expression is NF-κB inducible but whose degradation is IKK2-insensitive, provides a brake on chronic NF-κB activity. <b>(C)</b> Elevated IκBδ levels result in hyper-responsiveness of such cancerous cells to tonic developmental cues, that may contribute to pathological outcomes. <b>(D)</b> Elevated inflammation that is often associated with cancer may generate similar cellular hyper-responsiveness towards developmental cues via the signaling crosstalk, thus implicating a role of the developmental pathway in pathogenesis.</div></div>
