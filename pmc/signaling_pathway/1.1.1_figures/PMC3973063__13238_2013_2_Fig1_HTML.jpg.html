The binding of insulin or IGF-1 to the membrane receptors leads to the activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway and subsequent downstream events such as phosphorylation of FOXO1 and activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which regulate many important cellular events such as mRNA translation, protein synthesis, cell cycle progression, metabolism, and aging</div></div>
