SHP is then recruited to the miR-34a promoter and inhibits                                                 binding of the key activator p53 to the DNA, resulting in decreased miR-34a                                                 expression.  Inhibition of miR-34a results in increased hepatic SIRT1 levels.                                                  In contrast, under pathophysiological conditions such as fatty livers of                                                 obese mice, the dysregulated FXR/SHP pathway due to highly elevated FXR                                                 acetylation no longer inhibits transcription of miR-34a.  The dysregulated                                                 FXR/SHP pathway, along with acetylation of p53 due to cellular stress under                                                 metabolic disease states, result in elevated miR-34a expression, which                                                 contributes to decreased SIRT1 levels.                                                                  </div></div>
