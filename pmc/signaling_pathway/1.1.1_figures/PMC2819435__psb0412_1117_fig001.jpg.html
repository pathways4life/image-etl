From: Mechanisms of brassinosteroids interacting with multiple hormones. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A proposed network of brassinosteroids interacting with multiple plant hormones. BR signaling pathway is primarily inhibited by ABA signaling through certain unknown components, and BR may also regulate the ABA signaling outputs. BRs regulate auxin signaling via BIN2, while, reciprocally, BR signaling may also be regulated by auxin. BR affects the biosynthesis of ethylene and, in all probability, that of JA. Also, BR co-regulates physiological processes (black boxes), such as solute flow, with GA through primary signaling pathway or the level of phytohormones.</div></div>
