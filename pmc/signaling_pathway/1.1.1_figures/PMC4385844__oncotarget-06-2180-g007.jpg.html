A model for γ-H2AX action in HCC angiogenesis via EGFR/HIF-1α/VEGF <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>.  From: γ-H2AX promotes hepatocellular carcinoma angiogenesis via EGFR/HIF-1α/VEGF pathways under hypoxic condition. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">This signaling pathway was drawn by the Pathway Builder Tool 2.0. Hypoxia can induce the expression of γ-H2AX via cleavage of the DNA double-strand. The induced γ-H2AX could promote EGFR to translocate into the cell nucleus from the cell membrane through regulate COX2 expression. Nuclear localized EGFR was found to induce HIF-1α expression which resulted in VEGF expression and angiogenesis.</div></div>
