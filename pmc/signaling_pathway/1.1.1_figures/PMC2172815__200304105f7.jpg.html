(2003). Evidence presented here reveals that bFGF/αvβ3 and VEGF/αvβ5 differentially activate Ras-Raf-ERK signaling. This, together with our recent work (Alavi et al., 2003), allows us to propose a model whereby each of these signaling pathways accounts for protection of EC from distinct mediators of apoptosis. The αvβ3 pathway promotes an ERK-independent survival mechanism preventing stress-mediated death based on Raf coupling to the mitochondria, whereas the αvβ5 pathway prevents receptor-mediated death in an ERK-dependent manner. In addition, ERK is likely playing a general role in both pathways of angiogenesis because it regulates gene transcription, cell cycle progression, and cell migration, which are critical to the growth and differentiation of new blood vessels.</div></div>
