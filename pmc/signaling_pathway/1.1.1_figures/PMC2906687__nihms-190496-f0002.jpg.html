Adenosine induces synthesis of both, cGMP and cAMP, in corpus cavernosum. cAMP induction is mediated through A2B receptor on smooth muscle cells. Induction of cGMP by adenosine is most possibly mediated by activation of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in endothelial cells through A2B receptor signaling. NO upon diffusing into smooth muscle cells may induce cGMP. Both, cAMP and cGMP, activate their downstream kinases, PKA and PKG, respectively, which in turn phosphorylate their downstream targets resulting in a decrease in intracellular Ca+2 concentration that leads to smooth muscle relaxation. PKG also phosphorylates RhoA and inhibits RhoA-Rho kinase signaling pathway, thereby contributing to smooth muscle relaxation.</div></div>
