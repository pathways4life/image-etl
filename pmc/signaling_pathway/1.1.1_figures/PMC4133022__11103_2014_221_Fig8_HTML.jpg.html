From: WRKY45-dependent priming of diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice and the role of cytokinin in triggering the reaction. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for WRKY45-dependent regulation of DP biosynthesis. BTH acts on the rice SA signaling pathway, which is split into WRKY45- and OsNPR1 subpathways. BTH primes the expression of DP biosynthetic genes via WRKY45. M. oryzae infection triggers early accumulation of CKs, which in turn act synergistically with the WRKY45-mediated SA signaling pathway to activate expression of DP biosynthetic genes, leading to accumulation of DPs. MKK4-dependent pathways are also shown</div></div>
