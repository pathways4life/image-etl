During the very early stages in the primary culture, ROCK action predominates to favor suppression of precocious outgrowth of axons from the cerebellar granule cells. However, as these neurons express a high amount of mDia1 gradual decline in ROCK activity facilitates expression of Rho-dependent mDia1 activity and a subsequent recruitment of a signaling complex, which in concert with the Rac-dependent signaling cascade may help the transition from inhibition to stimulation of axon outgrowth and elongation. Thus, the SDF-1α/Rho/mDia1 pathway may play a critical role in defining and modulating the balance between the Rho- and Rac-based signaling pathways during axon outgrowth.</div></div>
