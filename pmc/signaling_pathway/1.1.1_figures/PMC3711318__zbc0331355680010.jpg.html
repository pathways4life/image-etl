From: 4-Hydroxynonenal Induces G2/M Phase Cell Cycle Arrest by Activation of the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated and Rad3-related Protein (ATR)/Checkpoint Kinase 1 (Chk1) <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Proposed model for activation of the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest induced by HNE.</b> HNE treatment stimulates a DNA damage signaling that is mediated by sensor protein ATR. Upon activation, ATR activates the phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase, Chk1, which phosphorylates/inactivates Cdc25C. Chk1-mediated phosphorylation/inactivation of Cdc25C and p53-independent activation of p21 both partially play a major role in deactivation of CDK1 kinase activity and dissociation of CDK1-cyclin B1 complex, leading to G2/M phase arrest by HNE. Simultaneously, HNE also stimulates the phosphorylation of H2A.X at Ser-139 and initiates the signal for the recruitment of DNA repair machinery.</div></div>
