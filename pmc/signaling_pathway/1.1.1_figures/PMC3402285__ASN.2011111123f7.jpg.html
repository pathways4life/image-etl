From: Tissue Plasminogen Activator Activates NF-?B through a <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Involving Annexin A2/CD11b and Integrin-Linked Kinase. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic illustration of the signaling transduction pathway in tPA-induced NF-κB activation. tPA promotes the interaction and aggregation of annexin A2 and CD11b, inducing the clustering and outside-in signaling of CD11b integrin, which leads to the activation of the downstream ILK, phosphorylation of IκB, and subsequent activation of NF-κB pathway. (A–C) Blockade of any step within this signaling cascade by various strategies eliminates tPA-induced NF-κB activation. (D) Ectopic expression of wild-type ILK mimics tPA effect.</div></div>
