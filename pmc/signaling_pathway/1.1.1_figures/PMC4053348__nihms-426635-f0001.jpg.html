From: A New "Brew" of MALT1 Inhibitors. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Role of MALT1 in signaling to NF-κB in ABC DLBCL. Shown are two prominent pathways leading to NF-κB activation in ABC DLBCL: chronic active BCR signaling and constitutive MYD88 signaling. MALT1 plays a key role in the BCR pathway in two ways. First, as a component of the CBM complex with CARD11 and BCL10, MALT1 helps recruit and activate IκB kinase (IKK). Second, MALT1 protease activity potentiates NF-κB signaling by cleaving and inactivating two negative regulators of IKK, A20 (TNFAIP3) and CYLD. Shown are recurrent mutations in ABC DLBCL tumors that cause or intensify NF-κB activity.</div></div>
