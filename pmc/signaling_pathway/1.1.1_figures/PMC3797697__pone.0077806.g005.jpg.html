(B) Representative western blot results and data summary of p-JNK and JNK in HaCaT cells infected with CD9-shRNA and Ad-CD9 adenovirus (n = 5). (C) Gelatin zymograms were shown for activity of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in the culture supernatants (n = 3). Mock-infected and CD9-silencing HaCaT cells were treated with JNK signaling inhibitor, SP600125 (SP).
