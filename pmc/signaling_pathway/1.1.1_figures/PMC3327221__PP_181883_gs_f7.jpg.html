From: Apoplastic Reactive Oxygen Species Transiently Decrease Auxin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> and Cause Stress-Induced Morphogenic Response in Arabidopsis1[W][OA]. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The auxin signaling pathway is modulated by apoplastic ROS. The binding of auxin to TIR1/AFB receptors leads to the degradation of AUX/IAA repressors via the 26S proteasome, allowing the activation of ARF transcription factors and changes in gene expression. O3 treatment leads to the production of apoplastic ROS, which could suppress the auxin pathway by decreasing the expression of TIR1/AFBs independently of miR393 and SA. O3 may affect the stability of Aux/IAAs (e.g. IAA10 and IAA28), or ARF activity could be directly modulated independently of auxin F-box proteins. ARFs regulate auxin-dependent gene expression, which includes Aux/IAA transcripts. Decreased levels of Aux/IAA transcripts provide a feedback mechanism counteracting the increased Aux/IAA stability. In addition, apoplastic ROS modulated the expression of several genes involved in auxin signaling, polar transport, and biosynthesis. Chronic O3 exposure leads to SIMR, which is under negative regulation of the auxin signaling pathway.</div></div>
