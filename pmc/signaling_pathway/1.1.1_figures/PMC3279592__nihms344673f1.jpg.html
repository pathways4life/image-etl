MN cultures received recombinant (r) TGF-β (10 ng/ml) after 4 hrs. Expression of uPAR, uPA, PA-1 and TGF-β mRNA were assessed in cell lysates after 24 hr. Expression of TNF a, not known to be under Smad3 pathway of TGF-β signaling, was also assessed as control gene (last panel). Inhibition of Smad3 reduced mRNA for all genes under this classical pathway of cell signaling. Induction of uPAR and its inhibition by Smad3 siRNA was most dramatic.</div></div>
