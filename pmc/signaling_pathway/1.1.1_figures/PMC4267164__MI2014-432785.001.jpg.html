TLR signaling is activated in a MyD88-dependent (black arrows) and TRIF-dependent (blue arrows) manner. MyD88 signaling leads to NF-κB activation, while TRIF signaling leads to both IRF3 and NF-κB activation. In the MyD88-dependent ubiquitination of TRAF6 is important to activate MAPKs (JNK, p38 and ERK) or IKK complex to induce the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. The TRIF-dependent signaling pathway can activate NF-κB, IRF3, and IRF7.</div></div>
