Modulation of the PKA <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> identified PKA-2 as a regulator of tubule morphogenesis.  From: A Protein Kinase A and Wnt-dependent network regulating an intermediate stage in epithelial tubulogenesis during kidney development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Spinal cord-induced MM was treated with PKA pathway signaling modulators and observed for defects in tubule morphogenesis. (A) Activation of PKA by stimulation of cAMP production (forskolin) or by adding cAMP analogues (dibutyryl-cAMP) prevented tubular morphogenesis. Activation of PKA-1 (8-PIP-cAMP and 8-HA-cAMPS) and Epac (8-CPT-2-O-Me-cAMP) did not inhibit tubulogenesis while activation of PKA-2 (6-MBC-cAMP and Sp-5,6-DCl-cBIMPS) prevented tubule formation. Inhibition of PKA with the Walsh PKA inhibitory peptide, 14â€“22 stimulated tubulogenesis. (B) Cartoon demonstrating the PKA pathway and the effects of modulation of specific parts on tubulogenesis demonstrates activation of the PKA pathway at different levels prevents tubulogenesis.</div></div>
