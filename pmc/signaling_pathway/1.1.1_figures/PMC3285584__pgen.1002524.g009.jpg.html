Briefly, Tgifs limit Smad2 transcriptional activity, which is required for activation of Fgf8 expression. Tgif regulation of the Nodal-Smad2 pathway is required for the correct balance between Gli3 and Shh activity in the Shh pathway. Dashed lines indicate that the links from the Nodal-Smad2 pathway to Shh signaling components may not be direct, and that the regulation may be of both Shh and Gli3, or may occur primarily via one of them.</div></div>
