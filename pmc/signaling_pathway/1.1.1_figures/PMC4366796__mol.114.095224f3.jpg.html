(A) Significantly populated canonical signaling pathways induced by bPTH(7-34) (red bars) or by hPTH(1-34) (black bars) in murine aorta. Each histogram bar represents the signaling pathway score (number of ligand upregulated pathway-populating transcripts minus the number of ligand downregulated pathway-populating transcripts. Signaling pathways within the yellow block represent the coherently regulated common pathways between the two ligands in the respective tissue. The associated Venn diagram indicates the functional signaling separation between bPTH(7-34) and hPTH(1-34) in the specific tissue experiment. (B) Bone, (C) heart, (D) kidney, (E) liver, and (F) lung all represent analogous data to (A).</div></div>
