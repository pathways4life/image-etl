The antiinflammatory mechanism of EPOR-βcR activation is associated with (a) the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, which leads to the inhibition of the activation of GSK-3β, which subsequently suppresses NF-κB activity leading to reduced expression of the NF-κB–driven gene transcription of proinflammatory mediators; (b) in parallel inhibition of the MAPK-p38 signaling pathway, which subsequently suppresses the production of proinflammatory mediators; and (c) the activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which leads to increased activation of eNOS, resulting in an enhanced formation of NO.</div></div>
