The bottom line shows conserved residues (*), which include the TRPV1 Y200 site (yellow bar). (<b>B</b>) Schematic diagram of the signaling pathways important in sensitization of TRPV1 by TrkA. The functionally most significant pathway is shown at the left (yellow, solid arrows). A smaller component of sensitization following exposure to NGF is mediated by phosphorylation of TRPV1 at residues S502 and S801, probably by the PLCγ/PKCɛ pathway (green, dashed arrows). PKCɛ is a crucial intermediate in sensitization of TRPV1 by bradykinin (pathway shown at the lower right of the diagram).</div></div>
