This model proposes that: (A) a given ratio between p85–p110 and monomeric p85 defines the insulin signaling pathway activity and the state of insulin sensitivity in the wild-type background. (B) In p85α(−/−) and p85β(−/−) mice, free p85 is preferentially decreased and the balance between p85–p110 and free p85 is shifted toward the positive mediator, p85–p110. This causes increased insulin sensitivity in the mutant mice. (C) In contrast, in p110α (+/−) and p110β(+/−) mice, the free p85 pool level is preferentially decreased (over free p85). This shifts the balance toward the higher levels of free p85, negative regulator, which inactivates IRS-1 and IRS-2 (free p85), resulting in decreased insulin signaling and insulin resistance. (D) Over expression of p85 causes an increase in the p85 pool which shifts the balance toward the negative regulator, resulting in decreased insulin sensitivity (This figure is a modification from Brachmann et al., 2005.)</div></div>
