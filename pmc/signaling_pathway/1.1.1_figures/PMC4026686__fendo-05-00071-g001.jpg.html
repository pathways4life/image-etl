NT produces via an antagonistic allosteric NTR1–D2 receptor–receptor interaction a reduction in the D2R agonist-induced activation of Gi/o leading to a marked reduction of activity in the cAMP–pCREB pathway. Instead, β-arrestin-mediated internalization and signaling may be favored due to a biased modulation of the D2R protomer via the allosteric receptor–receptor interaction in the heterodimer (see left part). The coagonist treatment also results in a facilitatory interaction in the activation of the MAPK–SRE pathway, which may take place in this signaling pathway at the level of PKC. Thus, the NTR1 agonist can activate the NTR1 protomer, which activates the MAPK–SRE pathway via Gq/11–PLC–PKC. The D2R agonist can target the D2R protomer and produce its activation of the MAPK–SRE pathway via several mechanisms, including β-arrestin–PI3k–PKC or β-arrestin–Scr–PKC (see left part). It should also be noted that this facilitatory interaction can also involve the D2R receptor homodimers and the NTR1 receptor homodimers (see right part). However, the facilitatory interaction may become stronger in the NTR1–D2R heteromer signaling since the NT protomer-induced antagonism of D2R protomer-mediated Gi/o signaling may favor the switch toward β-arrestin recruitment and signaling.</div></div>
