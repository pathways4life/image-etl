Enrichment hypotheses with multiple enriched pathways show increased support from data..  From: Integrated Enrichment Analysis of Variants and Pathways in Genome-Wide Association Studies Indicates Central Role for IL-2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Genes in Type 1 Diabetes, and Cytokine <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Genes in Crohn's Disease. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Each row gives pathway, or combination of 2 or 3 pathways, with largest BF for enrichment of disease associations. See Figure 1 for legend and abbreviations used. All enrichment hypotheses for RA and T1D shown here also include enrichment of the MHC, allowing for a different level of enrichment within the MHC. Unlike the BFs in Figures 1 and 2, BFs here are all defined relative to null hypothesis of no enrichment, so that they can be easily compared. Counts of genes and SNPs only include those that are not already assigned to other enriched pathways; for example, 37 genes belong to the IL-23 pathway, and of those 15 are already cytokine signaling genes, so inclusion of IL-23 signaling adds 22 more genes.
