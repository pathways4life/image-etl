Light regulates stomatal production via COP1 which is upstream of YODA. In stems or hypocotyls TMM dampens CHALf peptide binding with the ERf receptor. BR signals received by BRI1–BAK1 inhibit BIN2 activity. BIN2 suppresses SPCH by directly phosphorylating or indirectly thorough YODA or MKK4/5.</div></div>
