(a, b, c) The protein expression of fibronectin, collagen IV, and laminin was significantly decreased when exposed to high glucose conditions for 24 h in RPE cells by pretreatment with 20 μM LY294002 for 12 h. *P &lt; 0.01 versus NG or HG + LY. The data shown represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.</div></div>
