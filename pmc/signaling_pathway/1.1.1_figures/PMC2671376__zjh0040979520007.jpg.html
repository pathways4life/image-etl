Proteins shown in red, green, and yellow indicate decreased, increased, and unchanged, expression or activity of these enzymes in GRMD versus healthy muscle, respectively. As PP2A phosphatase activity was not statistically modulated in GRMD muscle, the protein is shown in yellow. The deregulations detected in GRMD skeletal muscle could lead to decreased protein synthesis and block compensatory hypertrophy.</div></div>
