From: Regulation of <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> genes by TGF? during entry into dauer diapause in C. elegans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Model for gene regulatory events under the control of TGFβ signaling. </b>Transcriptional regulatory events suggested by expression data in this paper are indicated in red. The TGFβ pathway is shown in green; DAF-3 and DAF-5 form a transcription factor complex that function in neurons to control dauer entry [9]. DAF-3 and DAF-5 are shown regulating DAF-9 and DAF-12 indirectly because these genes are likely to be regulated in non-neuronal tissues. Insulin genes are shown as directly regulated by DAF-3 and DAF-5, but it is equally likely that these genes are regulated by feedback from the insulin pathway or by DAF-12.</div></div>
