From: Genome-Wide Expression Analysis Reveals Diverse Effects of Acute Nicotine Exposure on Neuronal Function-Related Genes and Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Gene expression pattern of the P38 MAPK signaling pathway</b>. Genes shown in green are down-regulated, whereas those shown in red are induced by acute nicotine treatment. The genes significantly regulated by nicotine are those with closed blue edges. To demonstrate the expression pattern of the pathway, all the genes with expression ratios &gt;â€‰1.1 or &lt;0.90 relative to the controls are also shown. The genes in white with light gray edges are either not regulated by nicotine (expression ratios between 0.9 and 1.1) or were not measured in our analysis. The pathway was drawn by the IPA program.</div></div>
