From: Hematopoietic Stem Cells Need Two Signals to Prevent Apoptosis; Bcl-2 Can Provide One of These, Kitl/C-KIT <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> the Other. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model for apoptosis signaling in HSCs. The middle two arrows in each panel represent the two active apoptosis pathways that need to be blocked. It is currently unclear whether these represent two completely separate pathways, or two actions within one pathway. White arrows and text show the inactive pathway. Black arrows and text show the active signaling pathway. Bcl-2 is meant to represent antiapoptosis Bcl-2 family members. The top panel shows Kitl signaling in the wild-type HSCs. Although the proliferative signal from Kitl is conveyed, apoptosis is blocked only partially at best. In the middle panel, transgene-derived BCL-2, in combination with Kitl/c-Kitâ€“transmitted signals, blocks apoptosis, allowing the Kitl-conveyed proliferation, and possibly differentiation-inducing activities to be seen. In the bottom panel, multifactor stimulation also completely blocks apoptosis and results in specific proliferation/differentiation, depending on the factor combination used.</div></div>
