From: Innate Immunity in the Lungs. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Simplified diagram of some Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. Flagellin binds to TLR5; lipoproteins bind to cooperative clusters of TLR2, -1, and -6; LPS binds to the complex formed by CD14, MD-2, and TLR4; and bacterial DNA binds to TLR9, which is located in the membrane of phagolysosomes. MyD88 has a key role in the proximal signaling by these TLRs. Two LPS signaling pathways diverge from TLR4, LPS-1 and LPS-2. The LPS-1 pathway is mediated by MyD88 and through IRAK-4 and IRAK-1 leads to nuclear factor (NF)-kB activation and cytokine production. The LPS-2 pathway is mediated by TRAM and TRIF and leads to the production of Type I interferons and nitric oxide, and has a role in the adjuvant effect of LPS in adaptive immune responses. A more complete signaling map can be found in Reference 1.</div></div>
