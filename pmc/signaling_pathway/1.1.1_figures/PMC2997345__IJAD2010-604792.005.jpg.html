Subtractive representation of hybrid score generation after clustering of raft proteins from control and 3xTgAD animal rafts into receptor signaling pathways.  The data is presented as a numerical value of the control pathway hybrid score subtracted from the 3xTgAD pathway hybrid score.  Pathways in which the score in 3xTgAD was greater than the control are denoted in red; pathways in which the control hybrid score was greater than the 3xTgAD hybrid score are denoted in blue.</div></div>
