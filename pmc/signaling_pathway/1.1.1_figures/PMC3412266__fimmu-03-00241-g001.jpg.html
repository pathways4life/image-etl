PKCζ is required for the activation of ERK after antigen challenge and necessary for IκB transcription and for the activation and nuclear translocation of c-Fos. The transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes IL-6 and Bcl-XL, and the secretion of T-dependent immunoglobulins depend on PKCζ-mediated signaling. The aPKC inhibitor Par-4 blocks PKCζ activation and B cell proliferation. <b>(B)</b> Signaling pathways in T lymphocytes. After antigen presentation, downstream signaling through T cell receptor (TCR) takes place. Atypical PKCζ and PKCλ/ɩ are important for IKK activation and NF-κB nuclear translocation, together with p62 scaffold protein that links the aPKCs with TCR activation through MALT-1 and TRAF-6 proteins. Moreover PKCλ/ɩ activates JNK and NFATc1 nuclear translocation, required for Th2 differentiation of T cells. Signaling through IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) requires both atypical PKCs to fully activate Jak1/Stat6 pathway and therefore to Th2 differentiation. Par 4 inhibits TCR and IL-4R signaling pathways blocking the activation of aPKCs.</div></div>
