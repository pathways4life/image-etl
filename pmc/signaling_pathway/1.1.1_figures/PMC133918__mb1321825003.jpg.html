From: Dual Roles of Cripto as a Ligand and Coreceptor in the Nodal <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Cripto and Nodal act as secreted signaling factors. (A) Design of a coculture assay to assess the signaling activities of Cripto and Nodal. Two populations of 293T cells were transiently transfected and replated together to assay luciferase activity (panel B). Responding cells are distinguished from signaling cells by transfection with the A3-lux luciferase reporter plasmid. Alternatively (panel C), conditioned media from signaling cells were added without direct coculture. (B) Nodal is active when expressed by either signaling or responding cells. Cripto is active when expressed by responding cells, but also displays detectable activity when expressed by signaling cells. (C) Both Nodal and Cripto proteins expressed in conditioned media of transiently transfected 293T cells are active in this signaling assay; the left and right insets show the expression of Nodal and Cripto protein in conditioned media, respectively. (D) Conditioned media from two independent stable clones (#8 and #9) expressing mouse Nodal display activity; similarly, conditioned media from two independent stable clones (#37 and #44) expressing mouse Cripto are also active. The left and right insets show the expression of Nodal and Cripto protein, respectively, in conditioned media from these stable cell lines or from control stable lines containing the parental vector alone.</div></div>
