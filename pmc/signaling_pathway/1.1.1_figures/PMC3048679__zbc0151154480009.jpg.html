The AKAP-Lbc signaling complex is activated in response to α1-AR stimulation through a Gα12-mediated signaling pathway (17). Activated AKAP-Lbc promotes the formation of RhoA-GTP, which, in turn, induces the activation of a signaling cascade that includes PKNα, MLTK, MKK3, and p38α. The recruitment of 14-3-3 inhibits AKAP-Lbc Rho-GEF activity (19), impairs the interaction between PKNα and AKAP-Lbc, and reduces p38 activation.</div></div>
