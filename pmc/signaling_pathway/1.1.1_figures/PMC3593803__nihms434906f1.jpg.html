From: The Endothelium in Diabetes: its role in insulin access and diabetic complications. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Insulin receptors in endothelial cells co-localize with cavaolae, and insulin signaling in endothelial cells leads to two downstream signaling pathways. Activation of the ERK pathway leads to ET-1 release, causing vasoconstriction in vascular smooth muscle cells, and the PI3K pathway leads to NO release and vasodilation. Studies have also shown that insulin binding to the insulin receptor is required for transcytosis of cavaeloe, possibly for translocation of insulin from the plasma to the interstitial space.
