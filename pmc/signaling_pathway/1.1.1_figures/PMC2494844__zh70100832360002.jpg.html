A: cytokine-induced signaling in the presence of STAT5A/B. The growth hormone receptor (GHR) specifically recruits and preferentially activates STAT5A/B, which in turn induce the expression of specific sets of genes and elicit a STAT5 response. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)2 and SOCS3, 2 negative regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway, are encoded by genes that are controlled by STAT5. Members of the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines activate STAT3 and elicit a STAT3 response in the cell, while interferons (IFNs) activate STAT1. B: cytokine-induced signaling in the absence of STAT5A/B. In the absence of STAT5, both STAT1 and STAT3 can be recruited to the GHR, although with lower affinity than STAT5. Thus GH can aberrantly activate a STAT1 and a STAT3 program in hepatocytes as demonstrated by gene expression profiling. Moreover, impaired expression of negative regulators from the SOCS family will exacerbate STAT3 signaling.</div></div>
