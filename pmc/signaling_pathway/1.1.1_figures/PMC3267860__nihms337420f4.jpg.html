(<b>b</b>) High magnification images of spiny dendritic segments of direct (left) and indirect (right) pathway MSNs in mice that have selectively lost one (top) or both (bottom) copies of plexin-D1 in MSNs of each pathway. Direct pathway MSNs in Drd2-GFP;Drd1a-Cre;plexin-D1f/f mice show decreased spine density compared to their littermate controls. In contrast, indirect pathway MSNs in Drd2-specific plexin-D1 KO mice (Drd2-GFP;Drd2-Cre;plexin-D1f/f) show no difference in spine density compared to their littermate controls (Drd2-GFP;Drd2-Cre;plexin-D1f/+) (<b>c</b>) Summary of spine densities in direct and indirect pathway MSNs of the indicated genotypes. There is a small but significant loss of spines in direct pathway MSNs in Drd1a-Cre plexin-D1 conditional KO mice compared to Creâˆ’ (fl/fl Ctrl) and Cre+ (Het Ctrl) control mice (*P&lt;0.05; Mann-Whitney).
