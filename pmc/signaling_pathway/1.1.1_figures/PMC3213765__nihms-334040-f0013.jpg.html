(A) In the absence of Shh, Ptch resides at the base of the cilium whereas Smo is in the cytoplasm and the pathway is off. (B) In the presence of Shh or in medulloblastoma, Smo becomes located to the cilium. In the absence of Ptch or when Smo or SuFu are mutated, Gli and the levels of targets increase. Asterisk (*) identifies proteins mutated in medulloblastoma.</div></div>
