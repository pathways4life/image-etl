Parts of the pathway in V. fischeri are modeled after those described for V. harveyi and are described further in the text. The colors reflect proteins that are homologous between the two species. The acyl-HSL synthases are depicted as ovals. Although the V. fischeri AinS and LuxS proteins are homologous to LuxM and LuxS of V. harveyi, the acyl-HSL signaling molecules (represented by small circles) produced by the different bacteria are distinct. It is not known whether sRNAs are involved in bioluminescence control in V. fischeri. OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane.</div></div>
