Activation of the JNK MAPK pathway is required for induction of apoptosis of CLL cells. Arsenic trioxide treatment of leukemic cells also results in inhibition of the PI 3â€™K/AKT pathway; and pharmacological targeting of this pathway enhance the antileukemic effects of arsenic trioxide. The potential involvement of other MAPK pathways, such as the p38 MAPK and MEK/ERK pathways which play important roles in control of growth and survival of other types of leukemic cells, in the regulation ATO-dependent responses in CLL cells remains to be defined.</div></div>
