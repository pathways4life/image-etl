(Aâ€“C) Schematic representation of Drosophila LGs (Left) and the interactions among Col, Dpp, and Wg signaling in the PSC (niche, green) (Right). (A) In wt LGs, signals issued from the PSC maintain Jak-Stat signaling in hemocyte progenitors (red) and control the balance between prohemocyte maintenance and hemocyte differentiation (intermediate progenitors and differentiated hemocytes, blue). Col activity in the PSC both controls the expression of Hh, one prohemocyte maintenance signal (7) and the niche size by restricting BMP signaling to PSC cells, via activation of Dlp. A paracrine/autocrine Dpp &gt; dpp autoregulatory loop maintains a high level of BMP signaling and represses Dmyc in the PSC. Conversely, Wg signaling positively regulates Dmyc expression. Wg is epistatic to Dpp signaling in the PSC, but whether Dpp signaling only represses the Wg pathway or also acts in parallel to Wg in controlling dmyc expression remains an open question. *Represents the signaling pathway. The role of Dpp signaling in the PSC and roles of EBF2, BMPR1A, and Wnt in mouse osteoblasts (10, 44) highlight parallels between the Drosophila and mammalian hematopoietic niches. (B) Blocking Dpp activity in PSC cells leads to increased levels of Dmyc expression and increased number of cells. Because each PSC cell expresses normal levels of prohemocyte maintenance signals, the MZ receives more signal and more progenitors are maintained at the expense of differentiation. (C) Reducing Col expression in the larval PSC results in both down-regulation of Dlp expression and Dpp signaling and Hh expression, leading to an increase in the number of PSC cells, with each cell producing less Hh signal. The overall effect is restoring normal homeostasis in the LG.</div></div>
