From: Inhibition of mutant EGFR in lung cancer cells triggers SOX2-FOXO6-dependent survival pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In untreated cells, mutant EGFR drives cell survival by activating downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K and MAPK, which inhibit apoptosis through transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects on BH3-domain proteins, including pro-apoptotic BIM and BMF. In most cells (red lines), erlotinib treatment results in EGFR inhibition, inhibition of downstream signaling and increased pro-apoptotic proteins, leading to apoptosis. The high SOX2 induced by erlotinib through activation of FOXO6 in some cells (blue lines) counteracts the pro-apoptotic effects of EGFR inhibition, sufficiently decreasing the levels of BIM and BMF to delay the apoptotic response.<b>DOI:</b> http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06132.045</div></div>
