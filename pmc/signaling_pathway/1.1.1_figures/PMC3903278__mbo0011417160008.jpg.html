During early infection, the virus induces cofilin inactivation and F-actin polymerization via the EGFR-PI3K-Erk1/2-ROCK-LIMK signaling pathway, which may promote receptor clustering and initiate the entry process. Lipid rafts are clustered and serve as signaling platforms for EGFR-mediated cofilin inactivation. Subsequent viral penetration requires F-actin depolymerization through cofilin activation. Thus, the biphasic activation of cofilin represents specific cellular machinery usurped by HSV-1.</div></div>
