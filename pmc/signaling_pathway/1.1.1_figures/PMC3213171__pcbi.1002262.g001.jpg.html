The pathway assignments are indicated by the color of the reaction vertex in the network. (NA: not assigned; SGTP: small guanosine triphosphatase mediated signaling; PIP: phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate signaling; REC: recycling; ENDO: endocytosis; DEG: degradation; CELLC: cell cycle; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade; TRANS: transcription; CAS: Ca2+ signaling; GPCR: G-protein coupled receptor mediated signaling; ERBB: erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog receptor signaling).</div></div>
