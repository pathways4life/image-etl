Model representing TGF-β receptor complex in healthy (non-HHT) endothelial cells as compared to HHT1 and HHT2 endothelial cells. In healthy endothelial cells (non-HHT), ALK1 and endoglin are cooperating in the TGF-β/Smad pathway, and endoglin levels are maintained to meet the physiological needs of the endothelial cell. However, in HHT1 and HHT2 cells, either endoglin or ALK1 fail in the cooperative signaling. As a result, endoglin expression decreases below a critical threshold leading to impaired TGF-β signaling, and abnormal cytoskeleton and tube formation in HHT endothelial cells. These altered endothelial cell functions may explain the HHT phenotype. Adapted from Fernández-L et al.75</div></div>
