Nodes represent KEGG metabolic and signaling pathways and are connected based on the KEGG database [72]. Node size is reflective of the number of phenotypes associated with the particular pathway based on application of SEPEA (p â‰¤ 0.003) to gene lists annotated from The Genetic Association Database[1]. Intensity of node color is reflective of the number of environmental factors associated with the particular pathway based on enrichment of gene lists annotated from The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database[15].</div></div>
