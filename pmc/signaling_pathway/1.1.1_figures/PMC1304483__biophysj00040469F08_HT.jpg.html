Stochastic and Diffusion Effects on Individual Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Summary of stochastic and diffusive effects as a function of volume. “Severely degraded” indicates that the scatter or distortion in signaling response is so severe as to render the pathway output uninformative for downstream signaling. In the case of diffusive responses, “mixed” indicates that the response includes both washout and recruitment effects.</div></div>
