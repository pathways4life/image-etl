TLR3, TLR7/8 and TLR9 are located in endosome and sense dsRNA, ssRNA and CpG-DNA, respectively. All TLRs expect for TLR3 activate NF-κB and p38/JNK through MyD88. TIRAP and MyD88 are required for TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. TLR3 activate TBK1/IKKε through TRAF, and TLR4 requires both TRAM and TLR4 internalization for activation of TRIF-dependent pathway. Activated TRIF dependent pathways activate IRF-3 leading to IFN-β production. TLR7/8 and TLR9 require the complex of MyD88/IRAK1/IRF7/IKKα for induction of IFN-α.</div></div>
