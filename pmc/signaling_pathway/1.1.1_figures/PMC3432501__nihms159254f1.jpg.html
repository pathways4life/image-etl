The MAPK pathway is activated in vitro by Ras or Raf and the phosphorylation of MAPKinase (P-MAPK) is observed to indicate activation of the pathway. The NFκB pathway is activated byTRAF6, NIK, or MEKK1, and the phosphorylation of IκB (P-IκB) is observed to indicate activation of the pathway.</div></div>
