(A) P6, but not LOS and HMW, induces NF-κB activation. HeLa cells were stimulated with either NTHi or polymyxin B-pretreated NTHi, or HMW (1.0 μg/ml) or P6 (0.005–0.5 μg/ml). PB, polymyxin B. (B) Inhibition of NIK–IKKα/β–IκBα signaling pathway blocks P6-induced NF-κB activation. (C) Inhibition of MKK3/6–p38 MAP kinase pathway abrogates P6-induced NF-κB activation. (D) Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of either TAK1 or TLR2 inhibits P6-induced NF-κB activation, whereas overexpression of a wild type of TLR2 enhances P6-induced NF-κB activation. Values are the means ± SD; n = 3.</div></div>
