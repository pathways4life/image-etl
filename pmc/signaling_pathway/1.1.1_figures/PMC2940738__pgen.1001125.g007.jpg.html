Model for ETS-4 function as a transcriptional regulator..  From: ETS-4 Is a Transcriptional Regulator of Life Span in Caenorhabditis elegans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">ETS-4 functions in parallel to the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway (blue) to modulate a set of downstream targets (red circle). ets-4 may function upstream of (dotted line) or in parallel (solid line) to antagonize daf-16 function in longevity regulation. ETS-4-regulated gene set overlaps with that of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway acting through DAF-16 (blue circle) as well as that of ELT-3 (green circle), which directs the age-regulation of a majority of genes that change expression with age.</div></div>
