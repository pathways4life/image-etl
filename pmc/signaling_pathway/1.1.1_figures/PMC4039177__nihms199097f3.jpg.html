Low density lipoprotein modulate the Hh <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> inhibitory effects of itraconazole.  From: Itraconazole, a commonly used anti-fungal that inhibits Hedgehog <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> activity and cancer growth. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) High density lipoprotein (HDL) 100 µg/ml and (B) very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) 6.5 µg/ml cannot reverse Hh pathway inhibition by itraconazole. (C, D) Titration of low density lipoprotein (LDL) up to 120 µg/ml rescues either induced Hh pathway activity by ShhN ligand in Shh-Light2 cells (C) or constitutively active pathway in Ptch−/− cells (Goodrich et al., 1997; Taipale et al., 2000) (D) from the inhibitory effects of itraconazole. All signaling assays were performed in lipid depleted 10% calf serum media for Shh-Light2 cells (A–C) and 0.5% fetal bovine serum media for Ptch−/− cells. Data are mean of triplicates ± s.d.</div></div>
