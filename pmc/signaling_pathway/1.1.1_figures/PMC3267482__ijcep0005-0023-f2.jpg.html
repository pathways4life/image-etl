(A and B) Schematic illustration of a mechanistic model for c-Ret-mediated congenital deafness with neurodegeneration of SGNs in c-Ret-KI-mice. (A) Wild-type mice (WT) acquire normal hearing with phosphorylation of the c-Ret Y1062-mediated signaling pathway. P in A indicates phosphorylation. (B) Impairments of the c-Ret Y1062-mediated signaling pathway (blue double line and downward dashed arrows in B) cause decreased expression of calbindin D28k (blue arrow in B) via Akt/NF-ÎºB signaling, resulting in auditory nerve degeneration in c-Ret-KIY1062F/Y1062F-mice (c-Ret Y1062F). This figure was drawn on the basis of results of previous studies [1, 18].</div></div>
