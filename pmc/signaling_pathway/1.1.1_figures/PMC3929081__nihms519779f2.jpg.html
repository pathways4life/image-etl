From: Differential Tumorigenic Potential and Matriptase Activation between PDGF B versus PDGF D in Prostate Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PDGF D–specific signaling activates the JNK pathway. PDGF B- and PDGF D–overexpressing mPrEC (A) and BPH-1 (B) cells were serum starved for 48 hours and whole-cell lysate harvested to assess the MAPK signaling cascade, as indicated. BPH-1 (C) and mPrE cells (D) were used to further characterize upstream and downstream components of the JNK pathway as indicated. E, PDGF D mPrEC or BPH-1 cells were transduced with scrambled or β-PDGFR (shβR) shRNA. β-PDGFR knockdown was assessed via RT-PCR and its effects on Erk and JNK activation.</div></div>
