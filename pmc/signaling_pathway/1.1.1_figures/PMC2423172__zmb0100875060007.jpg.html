(A) Cardiomyocytes were infected with Ad-LacZ or Ad-MURC at an MOI of 10. After infection, cells were treated with vehicle or 10 μM Y-27632. Ninety-six hours later, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin. (B) Cardiomyocytes were infected with Ad-Luc shRNA or Ad-rMURC shRNA at an MOI of 20. After 48 h of serum deprivation, cells were treated with vehicle or 100 μM PE. Forty-eight hours later, cells were stained with phalloidin.</div></div>
