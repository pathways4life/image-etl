Interestingly, LOX-1 has the ability to up-regulate transcription of other receptors including itself; a mechanism that has been shown to aid in plaque formation during atherosclerosis. Downstream signaling of CLEC-1 is largely unknown; however, it does contain a tri-acidic motif that may have signaling potential due to similar signaling sequences in Dectin-1 and CLEC-2. Dashed arrows represent a pathway that has yet to be fully defined, and the grey arrow represents potential pathways based on other related receptor functions.</div></div>
