(A) Graphic analysis of quantitative changes in wnt pathway components during liver regeneration is shown. There is an initial 2.5-fold increase in β-catenin protein, followed by an almost 3-fold decrease. There is also a 0.5-fold decrease in wnt-1 protein as the degradation pathway for β-catenin is activated. Following this, there is a 7-fold increase in APC protein apart from elevated serine-phosphorylated β-catenin and axin. TCF-4 levels remain mostly unaltered during these events. This graph also depicts an inverse quantitative relationship between E-cadherin and β-catenin proteins. An initial increase in β-catenin protein coincides with a decrease in E-cadherin levels, followed by an increase in E-cadherin protein as β-catenin decreases. (B) A model of regulated growth is hypothesized. Modulation of wnt pathway by altered β-catenin levels (decrease in the wnt-1 protein levels following an increase in the β-catenin protein) favors a possibility of a feedback-inhibitory loop in this pathway. Excess β-catenin protein [1] may activate this feedback loop, causing a decrease in wnt-1 protein levels [2]. This may lead to activation of the degradation pathway for β-catenin through ubiquitination, thus limiting and regulating availability of residual β-catenin for nuclear translocation [3] to control the target gene expression and cell proliferation. Aberrations in this feedback inhibition or checkpoint may lead to growth deregulation.</div></div>
