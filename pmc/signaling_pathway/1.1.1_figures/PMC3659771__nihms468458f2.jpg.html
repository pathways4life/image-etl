Two main signaling pathways operate downstream of VEGF-A to induce arterial differentiation: the Notch pathway and the Phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) / Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The transcription factors Foxc1 and Foxc2 directly induce Dll4 and Hey2 transcription. VEGF-A signaling, by an unknown mechanism, augments Foxc1/Foxc2 induction of Dll4 and Hey2 gene expression. During venous differentiation, two different mechanisms inhibit artery differentiation. The orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TFII suppresses neuropilin1 expression, thereby suppressing reception of the VEGF-A signal and activation of Notch signaling. In addition, activation of PI3K/Akt signaling antagonizes promotion of arterial cell differentiation by blocking ERK activation.</div></div>
