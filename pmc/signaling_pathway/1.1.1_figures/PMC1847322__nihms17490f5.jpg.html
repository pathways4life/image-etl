(A): Pathways identified by IPA that are associated with the stable transcripts. The number of stable transcripts involved in each pathway is shown above the bars. There were 30 canonical pathways in total being identified to be associated with the degraded transcripts, and only the top 15 is shown here. (B): GenMAPP display of transcripts participating in the MAPK signaling pathway.</div></div>
