B, protein expression of CD38 and RyR2 in GFP-shRNA or CD38-shRNA-infected PC12 cells were determined by immunoblot analysis using either anti-CD38 or anti-Ryr antibody. C, Ca2+ increases in intact PC12 cells induced by a cell-permeant cADPR agonist, cIDPRE (200 μm), in the absence or presence of an antagonist of cADPR, 8-Br-cADPR (200 μm).</div></div>
