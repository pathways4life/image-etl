TCR engagement triggers sequential signals through CD3, ZAP-70 and SLP-76 as shown. Two pathways then diverge distal to SLP-76 that couple to IFN-γ gene transcription in the nucleus. The Late pathway (right side) requires both TCR and CD28 engagement, occurs following sustained activation and is associated with an accumulation of MAP kinase and distal phosphorylation and upregulation of T-bet expression. The Rapid pathway (left side) does not require CD28 costimulation, and is not associated with increased distal phosphorylation or T-bet upregulation. This rapid pathway requires NF[kappa]B transcriptional activity.</div></div>
