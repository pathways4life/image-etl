The integrated cellular network consists of two subnetworks. One is the signaling regulatory pathway (the green part in the figure) in which protein-protein interactions are presented and the other is the gene regulatory network (the yellow part in the figure) in which transcription regulations exist. The transcription factors serve as the interface between the signaling regulatory pathway and the gene regulatory network.</div></div>
