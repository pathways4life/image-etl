(<b>A</b>) sim commits mesectodermal cells to an MP4 fate. (<b>B</b>) wg signaling activates slp1/2 expression in the anterior region, which represses en and commits cells to an MP1 fate (pink). (<b>C</b>) hh signaling directs a group of anterior cells to an MP3 fate (green) by activating expression of gsb/gsb-n. (<b>D</b>) Notch signaling selects one cell in the MP3 cluster to become MP3. (<b>E</b>) H-cell and H-cell sib fates are determined by Notch signaling and asymmetric localization of Numb. gsb/gsb-n activate expression of l(1)sc and tup in the H-cell. (<b>F</b>) l(1)sc and tup control H-cell-specific gene expression and differentiation. Genes expressed in common between the H-cell and H-cell sib are regulated by a different pathway.</div></div>
