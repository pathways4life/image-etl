Model for progesterone regulation of cell proliferation in the mammary epithelium mediated by the RANK-RANKL paracrine <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>.  From: The Biology of Progesterone Receptor in the Normal Mammary gland and in Breast Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The mechanism depicted is based on work with the mouse mammary gland as an experimental model. RANKL is a direct target of PR induced by progesterone (P4) and is then released to interact with the RANK receptor on either PR+ or nearby PR− cells. In PR− cells, RANKL activates the downstream IKK/IkB/NFkB/cyclin D1 signaling pathway to stimulate proliferation. RANKL does not generate a sustained activation of the NFkB/cyclin D1 proliferative pathway in PR+ cells due to the suppressive actions of TGFβ and/or other unknown mechanisms.</div></div>
