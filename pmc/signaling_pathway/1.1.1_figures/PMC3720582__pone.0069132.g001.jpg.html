The green and red arrows are indicating Activation/Production and Inhibition process respectively. The black arrows indicate the nuclear translocation process. All the proteins of this network are allocated into four main regions with different color codes: Extracellular and Membrane (Blue); Cytoplasm (Red); Nucleus (Green); and Output (Yellow). The output proteins are linked with various cellular responses (cross talk with other pathways or phenotypic expressions) with black dotted arrow.</div></div>
