From: Agonizing Hedgehog. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The Hedgehog signaling pathway. <b>(a)</b> In the absence of Hedgehog ligands, Patched protein inhibits the activity of Smoothened, which resembles G-protein-coupled receptors. <b>(b)</b> On activation by a ligand of the Hedgehog family, the inhibition of Smoothened by Patched is relieved and Smoothened is freed to trigger an intracellular signaling cascade; this ultimately leads to transcriptional regulation by transcription factors of the Gli family.</div></div>
