This pathway is preferentially triggered by DAP-type peptidoglycan, common to Gram-negative bacteria and certain Gram-positives, especially Bacillus spp. DAP-type peptidoglycan can be recognized by different receptors, depending on its location and size. Large insoluble peptidoglycan is recognized on the cell surface by PGRP-LCx, while smaller peptidoglycan fragments, like TCT, can be recognized at the cell surface by a ligand-induced dimer of PGRP-LCx and PGRP-LCa. In addition, DAP-type peptidoglycan that reaches the cytosol can trigger another receptor, PGRP-LE. Both PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE trigger a similar intracellular signal transduction pathway, as outlined here, that culminates in the activation of the NF-ÎºB precursor Relish. In addition, recognition of intracellular DAP-type peptidoglycan by PGRP-LE also triggers an autophagic response, which is important in the protection against intracellular bacteria.</div></div>
