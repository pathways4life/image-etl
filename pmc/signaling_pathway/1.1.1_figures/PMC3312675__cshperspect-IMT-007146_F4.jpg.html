From: Central B-Cell Tolerance: Where Selection Begins. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Positive selection of nonautoreactive immature B cells into the peripheral B-cell compartment requires a threshold level of tonic BCR signaling. Differentiation of nonautoreactive immature B cells into transitional and mature B cells and entry into the peripheral B-cell population depends on a certain threshold of BCR expression and tonic BCR signaling, which is translated by the Ras-Mek-Erk signaling pathway. BAFFR expression correlates with BCR surface expression and tonic signaling, and BAFFR signaling contributes to the differentiation of immature into transitional B cells. The scheme is based on data from Rowland et al. 2010a,b.</div></div>
