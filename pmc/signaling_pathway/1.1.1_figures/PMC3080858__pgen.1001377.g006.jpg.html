PDP-1 links TGF-β <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> to the IIS <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> and DAF-16..  From: PDP-1 Links the TGF-? and IIS Pathways to Regulate Longevity, Development, and Metabolism. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Top panel: Under favorable environmental conditions, signaling through the TGF-β pathway activates the R-SMAD proteins DAF-8 and DAF-14, which regulate insulin gene expression while antagonizing DAF-3 and DAF-5 function. These insulins may act as agonists and activate IIS, thereby promoting phosphorylation and suppression of DAF-16 activity. In this feed-forward model, the worm undergoes reproductive growth and has a normal life span. Middle panel: PDP-1 negatively regulates TGF-β signaling through dephosphorylation of DAF-8 and DAF-14. Under these conditions, DAF-3 and DAF-5 repress the transcription of agonistic insulins as well as expression of the daf-7 TGF-β ligand and daf-8, leading to further downregulation of the TGF-β pathway. Alternatively, DAF-3 and DAF-5 may promote transcription of potential antagonistic insulins. This results in reduced signaling through the IIS pathway, enhancing DAF-16 nuclear localization. Lower panel: Under low IIS conditions, DAF-16 localization is predominantly nuclear, where it regulates the transcription of hundreds of target genes that act in combination to regulate longevity, stress resistance, dauer formation and the response to stress. Paradoxically, under low IIS conditions, DAF-3 and DAF-5 play opposite roles. DAF-5 is likely to synergize with DAF-16 and modulate the activity of its target genes. DAF-3 acts to antagonize DAF-16, either directly or through suppression of DAF-16 target genes. Therefore, the role of DAF-3 in modulating IIS depends upon the level of signaling through the pathway.</div></div>
