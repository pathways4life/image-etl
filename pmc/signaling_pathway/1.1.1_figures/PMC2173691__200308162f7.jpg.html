From: Autoregulation of E-cadherin expression by cadherin-cadherin interactions. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Mechanisms of E-cadherin regulation in sparse and dense cultures of colon cancer cells.</b> In sparse cultures, E-cadherin expression is suppressed by two different mechanisms. One involves activation of ERK (P-ERK) by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), such as ErbB-1 and ErbB-2. ERK activation induces Slug that inhibits E-cadherin expression by binding to the E-box of E-cadherin. The other pathway includes Slug induction by the β-catenin–TCF pathway. In dense cultures, the ERK pathway is inactive, the levels of ErbB-1, ErbB-2, and Slug are repressed and E-cadherin expression increases. This leads to recruitment of nuclear β-catenin to adherens junctions together with E-cadherin and the inhibition of β-catenin signaling. This further reduces Slug expression and relieves the inhibition on E-cadherin transcription resulting in elevated E-cadherin expression.</div></div>
