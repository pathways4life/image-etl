(Wang et al., 2007). <b>(B)</b> siRNA knockdown of several players of the Cofilin-1 pathway reduced the migration-promoting activity of ASCs. <b>(C)</b> Pre-treatment of ASCs with the specific Rock inhibitor Y27632 reduced the migration-promoting activity of ASC in a dose-dependent manner. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least 3 times.</div></div>
