(B) The effects of over expression of activated Smurf on [Hh], [Ptc], [Hh_Ptc], [activated Smo/Ci]. On the left, the levels of [Hh], [Ptc], [Hh_Ptc], and [activated Smo/Ci] correspond to the low level of [activated Smurf], and, similarly, on the right, the levels of [Hh], [Ptc], [Hh_Ptc], and [activated Smo/Ci] correspond to the high level of [activated Smurf] (i.e., over expression of activated Smurf). (For the value of each parameter, see Table S1.) (C) The effect of over expression of activated Smurf on the ratio [Hh_Ptc]/[Ptc]. For all three values of βHh_Ptc, the level of ratio [Hh_Ptc]/[Ptc] corresponding to the low activated Smurf is low (on the left). However, when the activated Smurf is over expressed, the level of ratio [Hh_Ptc]/[Ptc] corresponding to βHh_Ptc = 10−4 is significantly high. (For the value of each parameter, see Table S1.) (D) The effects of the inhibition of activated Smurf on [Ptc] and [activated Smo/Ci]. When the expression of activated Smurf is inhibited, the levels of [Ptc] and [activated Smo/Ci] decrease immediately (on the right). (For the value of each parameter, see Table S1.) (E and F–F″) Wild-type control discs were immunostained with anti-Ptc antibody to show Ptc protein expression (E), and wing discs expressing Flag:Smurf driven by ap-gal4 were immunostained to show the expression of Ptc (red) and GFP(green), which shows the area of Smurf expression (F–F″). (G and H–H″) Wild-type control discs were immunostained with anti-Ptc antibody to show Ptc protein expression (G), and wing discs expressing Src:Flag:Smurf driven by ap-gal4 were immunostained to show the expression of Ptc (red) and Flag (green) (H–H″).</div></div>
