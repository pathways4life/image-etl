Type I signaling involves the generation of ROS scavenging enzymes and antioxidant compounds as well as osmolytes. The involvement of a MAPK pathway in the production of osmolytes in plants has not been demonstrated experimentally. Under osmotic stress, altered MAPK signaling may contribute to changed cell cycle regulation and growth retardation. Type II signaling involves the production of stress-responsive proteins mostly of undefined functions. Pathways within Type II signaling are shown in Figure 4. Type III signaling involves the SOS pathway which is specific to ionic stress. Signaling events for homologs of SOS3 (SCaBP) and SO2 (PKS) are tentatively grouped with SOS3 and SOS2, yet these SCaBP-PKS pathways are not necessarily related to ion homeostasis. Connections between different types of signaling events are indicated with dashed lines. Arrows indicate the direction of signal flux. Primary sensors are shown to be localized in the membrane. Receptors for secondary signaling molecules (2ndSM) are not shown.</div></div>
