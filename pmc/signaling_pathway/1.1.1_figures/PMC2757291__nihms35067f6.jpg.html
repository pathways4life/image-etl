Thymocyte-mediated T cell selection pathway select T-CD4 T cells and NKT cells through homotypic interactions between TCR on developing DP thymocytes with MHC class II or CD1d on DP thymocytes, respectively (pathway 2). Our studies indicate that the SAP/Fyn/PKCÎ¸ signaling cascade is a common pathway required for the generation of both T-CD4 T cells and immature NKT cells, while T-bet and IL-15R are selectively involved in the maturation of NKT cells. Whether E-CD4 T cells and T-CD4 T cells share similar molecular requirements for their maturation is currently unknown.</div></div>
