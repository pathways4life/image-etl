TCR activation on recognition of MHC–Ag complexes on APCs leads to the phosphorylation of ZAP70, PLCγ and Lck. PLCγ hydrolyses PIP2 to generate DAG and IP3. DAG binds to and activates PKC, whereas IP3 binds to its receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and releases Ca2+ into cytoplasm. Activated PKC activates NF-κB by degrading I-κB through phosphorylation. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ leads to the activation of calcineurin (CN), which, in turn, activates NF-AT through dephosphorylation. Active NF-κB and NF-AT translocate to the nucleus and induce the gene transcription that is required for the T-cell response. Co-stimulatory signals through CD28 activate the JNK/p38 MAPK pathway, which activates AP-1 (FOS/JUN). CD28 co-stimulatory signals inhibit Cblb, which is a negative regulator of TCR signals. Signaling through CD28 activates AKT, which, in turn, inhibits SMAD2/3 phosphorylation. Co-stimulatory signaling through CTLA-4, which is a negative regulator of TCR signaling, induces Cblb. TGFβ-receptor signaling activates SMAD2/3 through phosphorylation. Activated SMAD2/3 binds to SMAD4 and the complex translocates to the nucleus. FOXP3 inhibits SMAD7, which is an inhibitory SMAD that inhibits TGFβ signaling. CBL-B also mediates TGFβ signaling in Foxp3 induction. CD25 is the α subunit of the high-affinity receptor for the IL-2 complex and IL-2 is essential for TGFβ1-mediated induction of FOXP3. FKBP12, which is associated with the TGFβ receptor, is released on ligand binding. FKBP12 binds to the IP3 receptor and modulates Ca2+ release from ER.</div></div>
