Pistil developmental signals switch on SCI1 expression which is potentially regulated by auxin- and cell cycle-dependent factors at the transcriptional level. SCI1 controls cell proliferation/differentiation in specific tissues, promoting proper pistil development. 1  This control is very probably exerted by SCI1 interaction with cyclins and/or CDKs, which causes the inhibition of the cell cycle. Conversely, SCI1 influences the transcript levels of auxin-responsive genes, probably through a feedback mechanism in the auxin signaling pathway. The SCI1 inhibition on cell proliferation helps to provide the fine-tuning of the auxin response to cell proliferation/differentiation in stigmas/styles.
