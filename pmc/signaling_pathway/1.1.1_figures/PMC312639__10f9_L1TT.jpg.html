From: Regulation of gene expression by the small GTPase Rho through the ERK6 (p38?) MAP kinase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for RhoA signaling to the c-jun promoter. Activated RhoA can initiate a signaling pathway inducing ERK6, which in turn activates MEF2A and ATF2 transcription factors bound to the jAP1 and MEF2 sites on the c-jun promoter, thereby enhancing c-jun expression. Available data suggest that Rho A, PKN, MKK3/MKK6, and ERK6 (p38Î³) are components of a novel signal transduction pathway involved in the regulation of gene expression and cellular transformation. Parallel pathways are depicted and described in the text. Unknown molecules are indicated by question marks.</div></div>
