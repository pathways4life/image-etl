DFCfgfr1 MO embryos exhibited downregulated foxj1a expression in DFCs (B; 17/18) compared with controls (A). Co-injection of wnt8a RNA with fgfr1 MO restored foxj1a expression (C; 16/19). Ectopic expression of wnt8a RNA alone had no apparent effect on foxj1a expression (D). (<b>E-H</b>) Ectopic expression of FGF ligands fails to restore foxj1a expression in embryos with reduced Wnt signaling. Downregulated foxj1a expression in DFCfzd10 MO embryos (F) was not restored by co-injection of fgf8a RNA (G). Ectopic expression of fgf8a RNA alone had no apparent effect on foxj1a expression (H). Shown are ventral views of 90-95% epiboly staged embryos. (<b>I</b>,<b>J</b>) Ectopic expression of Wnt ligands partially rescues cilia length defects in embryos with reduced FGF signaling. Shown are quantification of cilia length (I) and cilia number (J). Approximately 12-20 embryos were analyzed for each group. Data are represented as meanÂ±s.d. *P&lt;0.01.
