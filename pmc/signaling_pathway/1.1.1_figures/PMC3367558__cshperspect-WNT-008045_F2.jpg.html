(A) Mouse Wnt3 and zebrafish Wnt11r function during prepatterning. Wnt11r signaling through Unplugged/MuSK before innervation leads to aneural AChR clustering and also via a parallel signaling pathway to changes in extracellular matrix modifications (EMMs), possibly via chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) that eventually influence incoming motor neuron axonal growth cone guidance. Wnt3 signaling leads to the rapid and transient activation of Rac1 and AChR microcluster formation, which (B) in the presence of neural agrin at the time of innervation are stabilized in exact opposition to the presynaptic terminal.</div></div>
