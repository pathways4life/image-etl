Role of neurotrophins was assessed using gene silencing technique for TrkA and TrkB receptors..  From: Enriched Environment Prevents Hypobaric Hypoxia Induced Memory Impairment and Neurodegeneration: Role of BDNF/PI3K/GSK3? <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Coupled with CREB Activation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Results showed that knockdown of TrkB significantly increased caspase3 activity even in presence of enriched environment whereas blocking of TrkA has diminutive effect on caspase3 activity in comparison to TrkB inhibition. To further explore the signaling cascade, ERK and PI3K pathway was blocked with U0216 and Wortmannin respectively and it has been observed that inhibition of PI3K pathway significantly increases caspase3 activity (B) whereas inhibiting ERK pathway have no significant effect in group exposed to hypobaric hypoxia in enriched cage (C). Data represents Mean ± SEM. In “*” and “#” represents p&lt;0.001 when compared to control and hypoxic group while “?”represents p&lt;0.05 when compared to control group.</div></div>
