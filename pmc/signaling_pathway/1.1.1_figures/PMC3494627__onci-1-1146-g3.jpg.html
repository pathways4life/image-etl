Mature IL-1α and IL-1β mediate their functions by binding to the same IL-1 receptor I (IL-1RI) which is present on the surface of most cells (1a). Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) bind to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (1b). IL-1RI and TLRs share a common intracellular signaling pathway (2), which leads to activation of NFκB and hence to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα (3). Therefore, IL-1α and IL-1β function within positive feedback loops in inflammation. Because of this common signaling pathway, IL-1α and IL-1β operate as natural adjuvants, mimicking the detection of microbial products by TLRs.
