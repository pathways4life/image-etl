Basal, but not Dx, signal depends on Kuz.(C) N signaling in cells exposed to Dl is reduced by cholesterol depletion, but the fold change after ligand-induction is increased. Signaling by the ND505A construct is removed by cholesterol depletion.(D) RNAi knockdown of components of the GSL synthesis pathway preferentially reduces the basal N signal compared to Dx and ligand-induced signal. chol., cholesterol.(E) In cholesterol-depleted cells, ligand-induced N signaling is reduced by RNAi of Kuz, Dyn, and Rab5 but insensitive to Rab7 or Dor RNAi.(F) Rab5DN reduces basal, ligand, and Dx-induced signaling, but only Dx signaling is reduced by Rab7DN.Data are displayed as means Â± SEM (minimum n = 3), p &lt; 0.05 for differences stated in the legend (Student t test).
