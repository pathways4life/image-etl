Many Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> genes are expressed in the developing pituitary.  From: WNT <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> affects gene expression in the ventral diencephalon and pituitary gland growth. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">RT-PCR was used to detect expression of Wnt signaling pathway members and regulators during various times of pituitary gland development. RNA from the specified ages was analyzed using intron-spanning primers specific to each Wnt and Frizzled gene. For positive controls, cDNAs generated from adult and embryonic tissues were chosen that had previously been reported to express each Wnt or Fzd gene. Water was used as a negative control. HPRT PCR products showing +RT and âˆ’RT reactions confirm no genomic contamination in the e12.5, e14.5 or adult pituitary cDNA. PCR products were sequenced to confirm the identity of each gene.</div></div>
