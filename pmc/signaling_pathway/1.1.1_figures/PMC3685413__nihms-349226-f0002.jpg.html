From: SF3B1 and Other Novel Cancer Genes in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The nine genes with significant mutation frequencies fall into five core signaling pathways, in which the genes play well-established roles: DNA damage repair and cell-cycle control (Panel A), Notch signaling (Panel B), inflammatory pathways (Panel C), Wnt signaling (Panel D), and RNA splicing and processing (Panel E). Genes with significant mutation frequencies are shown in red, and genes with mutations that are in a signaling pathway related to chronic lymphocytic leukemia are shown in pink. A list of additional pathway-associated genes with mutations is provided in Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix. Co-A denotes coenzyme A, TLR toll-like receptor, and TNFR tumor necrosis factor receptor.</div></div>
