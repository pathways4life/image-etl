FACS plots demonstrated are representative from three independent experiments and are gated on LK+S+ cells.<b>(B)</b> Stimulation with 10 ng/ml IL-6, SDF, or Ang1 did not reveal measurable phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in LK+S+ cells.<b>(C)</b> Differential activation of MEK upon stimulation with SCF in Caspase-3 KO LK+S+ cells indicate an alteration in ERK signaling upstream of MEK.<b>(D)</b> No difference between the genotypes was observed in the kinetic of AKT- or Stat3-phosphorylation using the same conditions as for ERK detection</div></div>
