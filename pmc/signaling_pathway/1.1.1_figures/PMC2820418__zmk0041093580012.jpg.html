PRG5 induces filopodia and axon growth independent of Cdc42 and impedes RhoA-dependent neurite retraction. (A) Proposed model of PRG5 action on filopodia and axon growth. (B) Summary and proposed model of PRG5 signaling in the context of neurite growth inhibitors. The common neurite growth inhibitors Nogo-A and LPA (underscored light blue) act on their receptors, and their signaling pathway converge at the RhoA-Rho kinase pathway. PRG5 is localized in the plasma membrane and attenuates LPA and Nogo-A—induced neurite retraction and alleviates basal RhoA activation, whereas direct RhoA, ROCK or PIP5Kβ activation overcomes PRG5 induced neurites. Thus, PRG5 may act upstream of RhoA interfering with Nogo-A and LPA receptor signaling or alternatively PRG5 directly balances or impacts RhoA activation.</div></div>
