From: NVP-BKM120, a novel PI3K inhibitor, shows synergism with a STAT3 inhibitor in human gastric cancer cells harboring KRAS mutations. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic representation of RAS/PI3K/mTOR/STAT3 signaling. Constitutively active RAS can regulate the STAT3 pathway in dependent of the canonical PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, RAS can directly activate mTOR via RSK-mediated phosphorylation of Raptor. mTOR as a kinase fully activates STAT3, which is essential for RAS oncogenic transformation. In RAS mutant cancer cells, therefore, despite suppression of PI3K by NVP-BKM120, the RAS signaling still enables to maintain oncogenic transformation through activation of the mTOR/STAT3 signaling. Combination of NVP-BKM120 and AG490 may result in a synergistic effect on gastric cancer harboring KRAS mutation.</div></div>
