From: Antagonistic Interaction between Systemic Acquired Resistance and the Abscisic Acid-Mediated Abiotic Stress Response in Arabidopsis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed Model for the Crosstalk between Biotic and Abiotic Stress Responses.SAR is induced through the SA-mediated signaling pathway, which is activated by the HR to avirulent biotrophic pathogens. The ABA-mediated signaling pathway is activated by environmental stressors, such as salinity, drought, and, to some extent, by cold. Crosstalk between these signaling pathways, shown as broken lines, was shown to antagonistically regulate each other. Arrows indicate positive regulation, and blunt ends denote negative regulation. White arrows indicate the activation site of SAR signaling pathway by the chemicals BIT and BTH. Some genes functioning in the signaling pathways are also shown.</div></div>
