Western blot analysis of MAPK pathway (C) and Cell cycle pathway (D) levels in A549 cells and A549/CDDP cells. P-p44/42 MAPK, phosphor-p44/42 MAPK; P-SAPK/JNK, phosphor-SAPK/JNK; P-cdc2, phosphor-cdc2; P-Rb, phosphor-Rb; P-chk2, phosphor-chk2; P-p53, phosphor-p53. Signaling pathways on the intersection between differently expressed mRNAs and predicted target genes from differently expressed upregulated mRNAs (E) and downregulated mRNAs (F). Pathway analysis was predominantly based on the KEGG database. P-values &lt;0.05 using the two-sided Fisherâ€™s exact test were classed as being statistically significant. The vertical axis represents the pathway category and the horizontal axis represents the -log10 (p value) of these significant pathways.</div></div>
