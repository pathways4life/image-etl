LPS-induced signaling occurs through a common set of signaling molecules. LPS induces the expression of subset-specific TLR4 pathway modulators, which ‘fine tune’ signaling and allow for distinct immune outcomes in closely related cell subsets. These pathway modulators likely integrate both signals derived directly from TLR4 and exogenous signals from the microenviroment that contribute to the subset-specificity of the response.</div></div>
