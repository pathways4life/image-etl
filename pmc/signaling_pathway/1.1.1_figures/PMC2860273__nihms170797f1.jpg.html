From: The Ubiquitin Ligase Siah2 and the Hypoxia Response. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Hypoxic signaling connected to Siah. Under the hypoxia condition, hypoxia-activated p38 and Akt pathways positively regulate Siah2 activity through phosphorylation and induction, respectively. Siah2 is phosphorylated by p38 on its serine and threonine residues, which will enhance its activity. Akt pathway increases the abundance of Siah2 by induction of its mRNA through signaling pathways yet to be clarified. Induced and activated Siah2 modulates the hypoxic signaling through PHD3 degradation and HIF-1α stabilization on one hand. Although, it is not yet identified, other Siah2 substrates would also play roles on hypoxic signaling by both HIF-1α-dependent and -independent mechanism.</div></div>
