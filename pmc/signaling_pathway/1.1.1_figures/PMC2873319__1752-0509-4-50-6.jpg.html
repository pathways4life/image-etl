A. The kinetic model of TNF-α-induced NFκB pathway. The dashed box area indicates the simplified system. B. Biological schematic of TNF-α-induced NFκB pathway. Not all arrows represent direct physical interactions. Drugs used in this study and their key targets are highlighted. C. HUVECs were pretreated with three combinations at the same concentration 100 nM for 2 hours before being stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 6 hours. Cells were lysed and output signaling protein was probed by western blotting. The level of β-actin was used as an internal control for normalization. The gray values are recorded at the bottom. D. Ratio of ICAM-1 to β-actin was determined with densitometry. C, control, T, 10 ng/ml TNF-α, G, Geldanamycin, A, Aldehyde, P, PS-1145.</div></div>
