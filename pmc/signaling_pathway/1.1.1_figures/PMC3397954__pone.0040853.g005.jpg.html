From: Intracellular Retention of ABL Kinase Inhibitors Determines Commitment to Apoptosis in CML Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">K562 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Untreated cells served as a control. For analysis of signaling pathway inhibition cells were either lysed for Western Blot analysis or fixed for FACS. (<b>A</b>): Left panel: Western Blot analysis of signaling pathway inhibition after exposure of Ba/F3-BCR-ABL cells to imatinib for 2 h. Right panel: FACS analysis of STAT5 and CRKL inhibition using phosphorylation-specific antibodies. To assess signaling dynamics, this analysis was performed at three different time-points (0.3, 2, and 12 h). (<b>B</b>) The same analysis was performed using the second-generation BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Experiments were performed at least in triplicate and one representative experiment is shown.</div></div>
