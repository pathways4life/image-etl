Schematic of Fgf8/Wnt4/Lim1 signaling pathway required during nephron formation. (B–G) In situ RNA hybridization in kidney tissue sections generated from E15.5 embryos. Fgf8 (B, C), Wnt4 (D, E) and Lim1 (F, G) are expressed in nephrogenic progenitors in WT mice. Fgf8 expression is barely detectable in Kif3a−/−MM mice (C, C’). Expression of Wnt4 (E) is markedly decreased as is expression of Lim1 (G). (H, I) Histological sections from P0 kidney tissue. There are fewer S-shaped bodies (arrows) in Kif3a−/−MM mice (I) than in control mice (H). Scale bars: 25 micrometer.</div></div>
