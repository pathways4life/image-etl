(<b>B</b>,<b> C</b>) N-1 does not enhance ERα pathway but suppresses TGF-β signaling. MCF-7 cells were cultured in the absence or presence of TGF-β (1 ng/mL), estrogen (E2, 10-8 M), or N-1 (10-6 M). The mRNA levels of pS2 (<b>B</b>) and PAI-1 (<b>C</b>) were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. ** indicates p &lt; 0.01 and n.s. indicates p &gt; 0.05.</div></div>
