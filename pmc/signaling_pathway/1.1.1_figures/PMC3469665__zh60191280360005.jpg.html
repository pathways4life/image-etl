From: Differences in oxidative stress status and expression of MKP-1 in dorsal medulla of transgenic rats with altered brain renin-angiotensin system. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed signaling mechanisms regulating mean arterial pressure (MAP) and baroreflex function (BRS) within the brain dorsal medulla of transgenic rats with long-term alterations in brain renin-angiotensin system. A: oxidative stress but not MAPK signaling may be associated with hypertension and impaired autonomic function in transgenic (mRen2)27 rats with higher ANG II actions in the brain. ANG II produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) through NADPH oxidase and mitochondria. Both ANG II and ROS can activate MAPKs, which can further stimulate ROS production through activation of NADPH oxidase. Increased ROS or MAPK signaling can cause higher MAP and impaired BRS directly or through altered redox signaling and downstream gene expression changes leading to hypertension. ROS pathway is predominant in (mRen2)27 rats in the dorsal medullary region. B: reduced MAPK signaling may contribute to lower resting MAP and enhanced BRS in transgenic ASrAOGEN rats with higher ANG-(1–7) actions in the brain. ANG-(1–7) through upregulation of MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP-1) negatively regulates MAPK signaling. Whether unchanged levels of ROS in ASrAOGEN rats is through direct actions of ANG-(1–7) on NADPH oxidase or mitochondria, or through reduced MAPK signaling is not known (?). Reduced MAPK signaling within the brain dorsal medulla of ASrAOGEN rats may contribute to lower MAP and enhanced BRS through altered redox signaling and downstream gene expression changes.</div></div>
