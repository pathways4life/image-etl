Model depicting the LRP6 turnover pathways..  From: Dkk1 Stabilizes Wnt Co-Receptor LRP6: Implication for Wnt Ligand-Induced LRP6 Down-Regulation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The first pathway is mediated by Kremen. In the presence of Kremen, LRP6 antagonist Dkk1 serves as a bridge between LRP6 and Kremen and induces LRP6 internalization and degradation, terminating Wnt signaling. Furthermore, Kremen might directly bind to LRP6 and induce LRP6 degradation. The second pathway is mediated by Wnt/Frizzled. While Wnt binding to its receptors LRP6 and Frizzled (Fz) induces LRP6-Wnt-Fz complex formation, the endocytosis and Wnt/LRP6 signaling decay of this complex occur after Wnt signaling activation. Dkk1 blocks Wnt binding to LRP6 and then inhibits LRP6 turnover mediated by Wnt/Fz.</div></div>
