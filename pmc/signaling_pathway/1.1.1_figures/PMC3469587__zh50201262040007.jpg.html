Schematic diagram is based on our previous report (26) and current results of how SP-A regulates Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling through multiple mechanisms: early, by dephosphorylating key biochemical signaling molecules such as Akt and MAPKs and, later, by upregulating negative regulators (i.e., IRAK-M) of the TLR signaling pathway.
