(A) Effects of actinomycin-D at 1 μg/ml, cycloheximide at 1 μg/ml, forskolin at 25 μM, and cyclopamine at 240 nM added to the culture medium on NCC spreading on FN in the presence of Shh at 20 μg/ml. Spreading was measured by using NCCs that have been collected from explants previously cultured on FN in the absence of Shh. (B–E) Effects of forskolin at 25 μM (B and C) and cyclopamine at 240 nM (D and E) on NCC migration from neural tube explants cultured on FN without (B and D) or with (C and E) Shh at 20 μg/ml. No reversion of the inhibition of NCC adhesion and migration can be observed when transcription or protein synthesis are blocked or when Smoothened and Gli activities are inhibited.
