From: A TRIF-INDEPENDENT BRANCH OF TLR3 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">SIGNALING</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A new branch of TLR3 signaling. The Src-dependent branch of TLR3 signaling pathway is distinct from the gene induction branch. DsRNA-stimulated dimerization of TLR3 leads to Src recruitment, its auto-phosphorylation leading to transient functional activation, followed by sequestration in the lipid rafts as an inactive pool, causing inhibition of cell migration, proliferation and adhesion.</div></div>
