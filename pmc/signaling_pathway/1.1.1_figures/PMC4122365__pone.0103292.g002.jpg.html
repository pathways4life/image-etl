Down-regulated genes are colored green and are highly enriched for DNA replication, cell cycle and DNA repair. Up-regulated genes are colored red and relate primarily to development and metabolism. In both cases, more intensive color indicates greater fold-enrichment [ranges: (−1.36)–(−4.61); 1.57–4.84] and size reflects the number of genes identified (4–195). (B) DAVID [11], [12]-identified KEGG [14], [15] and Panther [16] signaling pathway enrichment of genes differentially expressed in post-eclosion AF. The number of differentially expressed pathway genes is plotted and the total number of pathway genes is indicated below each pathway name (HH = Hedgehog, Jk-ST = Jak-STAT, PhosIn = Phosphatidylinositol, TGFB = TGF-beta, Cadh = Cadherin, Ins/IGF = Insulin/IGF).</div></div>
