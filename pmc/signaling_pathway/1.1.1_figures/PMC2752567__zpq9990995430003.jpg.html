From: Genetic heterogeneity of Myc-induced mammary tumors reflecting diverse phenotypes including metastatic potential. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Pathway probabilities cluster tumor samples. Probability of pathway activation for MMTV-Myc, MMTV-Myc T58A, and MMTV-Neu tumors was calculated for the genes and conditions listed on the right axis of the heat map. Probability (from 0 to 1) is represented by a color scale with the probability of being like control represented in blue and probability of being like the signaling pathway of interest being red. The probabilities were clustered for pathways and the samples were ordered in the same sequence shown for unsupervised clustering in Fig. 4. The histology, genotype, and kras mutation status are shown for each sample with the color codes being identified in the legend and kras mutations being illustrated with an Ã— (A). The predicted probability of Ras pathway activation was graphed against Myc pathway activation with r2 = 0.5651 with P &lt; 0.0001 (B). The probability of Ras pathway activation was also examined in tumors with wild type and mutant kras sequence. Using a Mann-Whitney test, the significance was illustrated with P &lt; 0.0001 (C).</div></div>
