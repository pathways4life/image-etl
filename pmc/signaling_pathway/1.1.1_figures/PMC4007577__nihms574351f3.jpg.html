Expression was normalized to NT value for each set of experiment (n = 4). *p &lt; 0.05 with t-test. <b>C.</b> A representative Western Blot for Id1, a BMP/Smad1/5/8 signaling target. <b>D.</b> Quantification of Western Blots showing that EGF-induced Id1 expression was blocked significantly by PI3K/AKT inhibition. The Id1/actin ratio of non-treated (NT) explants is normalized to 1 for each set of experiment (n = 3). *p &lt; 0.05 with t-test. Error bars: SEM.</div></div>
