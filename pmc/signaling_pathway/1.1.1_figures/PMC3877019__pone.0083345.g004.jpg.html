Gray fields indicate their presence in the “Mouse High CPE expression sub-dataset (&gt;90th P)”; uncolored genes are added by the Ingenuity software to show the entire standard pathway. Solid lines between molecules indicate direct physical relationships between molecules (such as regulating and interacting protein domains). Abbreviations of gene names are according to standard abbreviations used in GenBank. As shown, the majority of genes of this pathway are highly expressed in the mouse CPE.</div></div>
