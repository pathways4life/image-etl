ExoS is delivered into host cells through type III machinery. Both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic (or proliferation) signaling pathways are implicated. In the proapoptotic pathway, ExoS targets unknown intracellular factor(s) to initiate the apoptotic signal, leading to the activation of JNK1, which results in cytochrome c release and caspase 9 activation. Caspase 3 is then activated and executes the apoptosis program. This pathway is also potentiated by inhibition of an antiapoptotic pathway by the ExoS, which likely occurs through the inhibition of Ras and Ras-associated Raf-MEK-ERK signaling.</div></div>
