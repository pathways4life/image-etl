The Notch pathway is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling mechanism implicated in cell fate determination and differentiation of endothelial cells. Notch signaling begins with receptor–ligand interaction between neighboring cells. This interaction triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages of the Notch receptor. The final one, catalyzed by the γ-secretase complex, releases the active Notch intercellular domain (NICD) from the cell membrane. NICD is translocated to the nucleus, where it interacts directly with the transcription factor CSL. Following binding of NICD to CSL, the repressor complex is converted into an activating complex by displacing corepressors and recruiting coactivators. After the coactivator complex is recruited, the transcription of promoters that contains CSL-binding elements is induced. Hairy/enhancer of split (HES) and HES-related proteins (HEY/HRT/HERP) family genes are included among the target genes of Notch signaling. Dll4 ligand is also a target gene regulated by the Notch signaling pathway.</div></div>
