Differential protein expression was determined by comparing samples that were harvested after radiation treatment to unirradiated samples for each cell type. Canonical pathway enrichment analysis shows a robust oxidative stress response signaling by ATCL8 with an enrichment of proteins in integrin, VEGF and Ephrin receptor signaling (Panel A) in contrast to AT5BIVA (Panel B).</div></div>
