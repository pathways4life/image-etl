Antiviral Innate Immune <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Insects.  From: Innate antiviral immunity in Drosophila. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Four pathways including three classical immune signaling pathways (Toll, Imd, Jak-STAT) are responsive to infection by different viruses (blue text) based on studies in both Drosophila and mosquitoes (italics). The Toll pathway, responsive to fungi and gram-positive bacteria, has been found to be antiviral in response to infection by Drosophila X and Dengue viruses. The Imd pathway, responsive to gram-negative bacteria, is antiviral in response to infection with Sindbis and Cricket Paralysis viruses. The Jak-STAT pathway restricts infection by Drosophila C and Dengue viruses. Some downstream effectors were induced by infection (red text, italicized for studies in mosquitoes). In addition, Drosophila recognize VSV via the glycoprotein VSV-G (the PAMP), through an unidentified PRR which leads to attenuation of nutrient signaling, likely at the level of PI3K. Repression of this pathway results in the induction of antiviral autophagy which attenuates VSV replication.</div></div>
