From: Redox Regulation of Multidrug Resistance in Cancer Chemotherapy: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Opportunities. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>NF-κB signaling and MDR gene expression.</b> Activation of mdr1b expression by the carcinogens 2–AAF and DEN is shown in two different pathways but converges into NF-κB signaling. Induction by 2–AAF is through the activation of PI3K signaling, whereas that by DEN occurs through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway. Membrane TLRs recognize external signals. When activated, the majority of TLRs induce activation of NF-κB and cytokine production in a MyD88–mediated manner. Also shown is the nonconventional transduction pathway induced by CD40 and EBV.</div></div>
