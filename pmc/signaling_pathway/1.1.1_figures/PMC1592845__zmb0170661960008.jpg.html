In wild-type cells, components of the Ras pathway are not found in association with F-actin during stationary phase. A reduction in Ras activity leads to a fall in cAMP, which results in PKA inactivation and the downregulation of signaling (A). (B) In actin-stabilized cells, components of the cAMP generation machinery, adenylyl cyclase (Cyr1p) and Srv2p, are found in association with large aggregates of actin during stationary phase and Ras2p is found to be constitutively active. This hyperactive Ras signaling state gives rise to the elevation of cAMP and the activation of PKA. This cascade of events triggers the elevation of ROS derived from the mitochondria and apoptosis. The PKA subunit Tpk3p is primarily responsible for the induction of apoptosis in response to actin-mediated hyperactivation of the Ras signaling pathway. It is likely that Tpk3p acts directly on both F-actin regulatory proteins and alters the enzymatic content of mitochondria to elicit this response. The combination of aggregated actin and constitutive Ras signaling may act together to establish conditions which lead to apoptotic cell death.</div></div>
