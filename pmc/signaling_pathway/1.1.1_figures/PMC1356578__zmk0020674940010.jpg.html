From: G Protein-coupled Receptor Gpr4 Senses Amino Acids and Activates the cAMP-PKA <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in Cryptococcus neoformans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for the Gpr4, Gpa1-activated cAMP signaling pathway in C. neoformans. Two signal inputs to the cAMP signaling pathway are proposed in this model and involve nutrient transport and sensing. Fermentable carbon sources, such as glucose, are transported into the cell via hexose transporters and phosphorylated by hexose kinases to produce glucose-6-phosphate (Glu6P), which in turn regulates Cac1 or Gpa1 activation to engage cAMP signaling. Glucose may also be sensed by an unknown receptor to activate the cAMP pathway. Gpr4 may also play a role in low glucose concentration sensing based on the cAMP assay results. In this model, Gpr4 is an amino acid sensor and interacts with Gpa1 to regulate downstream elements of the cAMP pathway. This model does not exclude that other proteins such as methionine permease may participate in ligand sensing via direct or indirect interactions with Gpr4. Hxt, hexose transporters; Hxk, hexose kinases; Glu6P, glucose-6-phosphate.</div></div>
