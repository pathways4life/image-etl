Classification of differentially expressed genes into various canonical pathways by Ingenuity <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> analysis (IPA)..  From: Gene Expression Profiling of Preovulatory Follicle in the Buffalo Cow: Effects of Increased IGF-I Concentration on Periovulatory Events. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The pathway analysis indicates that a large number of differentially expressed genes belonged to canonical pathways such as PI3K/AKT signaling; IGF-I signaling and coagulation system. The orange line represents score for the likelihood [−log (B–H P&lt;0.05)] that genes belonging to a specific signaling pathway category affected at 1 and 22 h post peak LH surge. The stacked bars indicate the percentage of genes distributed according to regulation i.e. green (down), red (up) and open bars (No overlap with dataset) in each canonical pathway.</div></div>
