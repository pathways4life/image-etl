Components and reactions in red promote counter clockwise (CCW) flagellar rotation; those in green promote clockwise (CW) flagellar rotation. Components in gray represent inactive forms. Solid lines represent enzymatic reactions; broken lines indicate binding interactions. CheA-derived phosphoryl groups are shown as blue spheres. Receptor modification sites are shown as white (unmethylated) and black (methylated) circles.</div></div>
