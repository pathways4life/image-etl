TLR4 not only serves as a key sensor of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) but also is proposed recently to act as a receptor for some endogenous molecules called “alarmins”. HDACIs block TLR4 signaling at multiple steps; therefore, they can inhibit immune response for both hemorrhagic shock and septic shock.</div></div>
