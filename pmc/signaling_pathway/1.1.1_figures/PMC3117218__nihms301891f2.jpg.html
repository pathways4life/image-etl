Scaffold proteins can mediate <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> regulation and feedback to shape complex <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> responses.  From: Scaffold Proteins: Hubs for Controlling the Flow of Cellular Information. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A) Scaffold proteins are analogous to circuit boards - modular platforms that wire together components and direct the flow of information - and can program complex signaling behaviors. B) Scaffold proteins function to wire pathway input and output through alternative possible routes. C) Scaffold proteins can mediate branching of pathways to multiple outputs. D) Scaffold proteins are themselves the targets of regulation. In T-cell signaling, activation of the T-cell receptor causes phosphorylation of the LAT and Slp76 scaffolds by Zap70, and phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of substrates leads to PLCÎ³ activation and PIP2 hydrolysis. E) Scaffold proteins can be the target of feedback phosphorylation that tunes pathway responses. Feedback phosphorylation of the KSR scaffold by activated ERK blocks Raf (MAPKKK) binding and attenuates MEK activation, thereby decreasing pathway output. Plot adapted from (24).</div></div>
