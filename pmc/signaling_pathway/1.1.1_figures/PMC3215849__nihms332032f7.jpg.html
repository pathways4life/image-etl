Constitutive and continuous upstream pathway signaling by Mer, Kib, and Lgl promotes yR8 fate, while repression of warts by Melt disrupts Hippo signaling to specify pR8 fate. Genes in black or colored font are expressed and active in that particular cell; genes in gray font are not expressed or not active.</div></div>
