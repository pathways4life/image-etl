Proposed model of FGF23-Klotho function in parathyroid glands..  From: Parathyroid-Specific Deletion of Klotho Unravels a Novel Calcineurin-Dependent FGF23 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> That Regulates PTH Secretion. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">FGF23 is an endocrine ligand that in the parathyroid glands either binds to an FGF-receptor and membrane-bound Klotho, to elicit activation of the MAPK-pathway, or acts via a calcineurin-dependent signaling pathway. Both pathways induce a rapid inhibition of PTH secretion within 15 minutes. The MAPK-pathway is likely the dominant pathway in physiology, although their relative contributions are unknown. In addition to mediating MAPK-dependent FGF23 signaling, Klotho may play an intrinsic role in modulating parathyroid transcriptional activity for sustained demands and long-term parathyroid function. Speculatively, the clinical use of calcineurin inhibitors (CNi) that block calcineurin signaling may increase the susceptibility to develop, or aggravate pre-existing, hyperparathyroidism in patients with reduced Klotho level such as in chronic kidney disease and primary hyperparathyroidism.</div></div>
