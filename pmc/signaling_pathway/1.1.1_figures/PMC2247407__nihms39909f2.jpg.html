The Wnt-Frizzled signaling pathway employs Akt to impact upon the survival of neurons, endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes to prevent cellular injury and promote angiogenesis. Through the activation of Akt, microglial activity is modulated to block harmful cytokine release and prevent the phagocytosis of cells “tagged” by cellular phosphatidylserine (PS) membrane exposure. The Wnt-Frizzled signaling pathway function in cardiovascular remodeling that involves regulation of LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) and reduction in MI (myocardial infarction) and HF (heart failure).</div></div>
