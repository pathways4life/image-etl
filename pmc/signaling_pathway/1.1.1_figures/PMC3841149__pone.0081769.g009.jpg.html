Interactions between WNT3 and SHH <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways in GCPs..  From: WNT3 Inhibits Cerebellar Granule Neuron Progenitor Proliferation and Medulloblastoma Formation via MAPK Activation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) binds Patched (PTCH) receptor, relieving its inhibition of Smoothened (SMO), and stimulating GCP proliferation. In WNT3 signaling, WNT3 binds an undefined receptor to activate MAPK signaling via a non canonical WNT pathway to promote GCP differentiation, whereas other WNTs bind Frizzled (FRZ) receptor to activate the canonical Î²-catenin pathway and stimulate proliferation. We propose a model whereby regulation of MAPK activity by WNT3 signaling alters the balance between proliferation and differentiation in GCPs, decreasing proliferation and increasing differentiation.</div></div>
