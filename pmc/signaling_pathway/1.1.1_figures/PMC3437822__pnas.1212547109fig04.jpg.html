(A) ABA-induced growth inhibition in roots. The WT, single mutants, gef1/4 double mutant, and gef1/4/10 triple mutant were grown on MS medium for 5 d before transfer to MS containing 12 μM ABA. Root length was then measured 3 d after transfer. Each value is the average ± SE of three replicates of 30 plants. Three separate experiments were conducted. (B) ABA-induced stomatal closure in WT and gef mutants. Leaves were treated with 5 μM ABA for 1 h before stomatal apertures were measured. Each value is the average ± SE of 3 independent experiments with 10 apertures each. (C) Working model for FER pathway in regulating response to ABA. The FER–GEF–ROP/ARAC pathway is an essential module for the auxin response in cell growth. ABI2 is a major component of ABA signaling pathway. The ROP11/ARAC10–ABI2 interaction mediates cross-talk between the auxin and ABA signals. Arrows denote activation, and bars indicate repression. Details are described in the text.</div></div>
