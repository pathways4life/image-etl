Itraconazole inhibits Hh <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>.

In the absence of Hh, Patched (Ptch) suppresses Smoothened (Smo) function. Hh, when present, binds to and inhibits Ptch, permitting Smo accumulation in the primary cilium (not shown) and causing activation of the pathway via the Gli family of transcription factors. Ptch and Gli1 are themselves transcriptional targets of the pathway. Oxysterols (dashed green bracket) act between Ptch and Smo, as pathway activators, whereas statins (dashed red bracket) act downstream of Ptch and at or upstream of Smo, as pathway inhibitors. SAG and cyclopamine activate and inhibit the pathway, respectively, by binding to the transmembrane domain of Smo. Activators and inhibitors of the pathway are labeled in green and red, respectively. (B) Hh signaling assays. Luciferase reporter activity under the control of an 8×-Gli binding site in the Shh-Light2 reporter cell line was measured upon stimulation with ShhN-containing medium. Itraconazole blocked Hh pathway activity (IC50≈800 nM). (C) Schematic view of mammalian cholesterol biosynthesis from 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase whereas azole antifungal drugs inhibit 14α-lanosterol demethylase (14LDM), as indicated. Lathosterol and desmosterol are cholesterol precursors downstream of 14LDM. (D) Among the azole antifungals, itraconazole was the most potent inhibitor of Hh pathway activity. (E) Hydroxy-itraconazole, the major metabolite of itraconazole in mammals, also inhibited the Hh pathway (IC50 ≈1.2 µM). All signaling assays were performed with Shh-Light2 cells in 0.5% serum media and data are shown as the mean of triplicates ± s.d.See also Figure S1 and Table S1.</div></div>
