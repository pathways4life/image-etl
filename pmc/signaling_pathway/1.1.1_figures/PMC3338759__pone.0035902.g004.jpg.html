IFN-λ3 (100 ng/ml) was added to the cultures 4 days postinfection for 24 h. Total nucleotide were extracted from macrophages and subjected to the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for mRNA expression of TLRs (<b>A</b>), IRFs (<b>B</b>) and the key elements in IFN-λ3 signaling pathway (<b>C</b>). Seven-day-cultured macrophages neither infected with HIV Bal strain nor treated with IFN-λ3 were set as control for a fair comparison with that in Figure 3. The data shown were the mean ± standard deviation of triplicate culture (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01).</div></div>
