From: Molecular Neuropathology of Gliomas. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Core pathways involved in the pathogenesis of gliomas.Note the interrelationships between p53, RB, growth factor receptor, PTEN/PI3K/AKT and RAS signaling on the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. While TP53 mutation, amplification of MDM2/MDM4 or p14ARF deletion/methylation inhibits apoptosis, alterations in p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c and p21waf1 disinhibit cell cycle progression at the G1/S-phase checkpoint via cyclin-dependent kinases by phosphorylation of RB1 and release of E2F transcription factors. Amplification, overexpression or mutation of growth factor receptors stimulates cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis through both the RAS as well as the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The RAS signaling pathway can be alternatively activated by mutations in the NF1, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by mutations in the PTEN gene and less commonly, the PIK3CA or the PIK3R1 gene.</div></div>
