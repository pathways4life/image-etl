From: Chronic unpredictable stress regulates visceral adipocyte-mediated glucose metabolism and inflammatory circuits in male rats. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Stress‐induced intracellular signaling pathway activation in rat epididymal adipocytes. Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat depots after collagenase digestion and total protein was collected and subjected to multiplex immunoassay using a panel of 13 intracellular signaling phosphor‐kinases. (A) Activation of JNK, PKCs as well as (B) the NF‐κB pathway and (C) MAPK pathways are activated by stress (the networks for JNK and ERK are also identified as among the top activated in our network analyses, sides of A and B) have been shown to adversely affect insulin signaling in different tissues.
