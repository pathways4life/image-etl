From: Hormonal Induction and Roles of Disabled-2 in Lactation and Involution. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Canonical TGF-beta signaling pathway consists of Smad phosphorylation and mediation of transcriptional regulation, leading to cell death and growth suppression, representing a tumor suppressor activity. The non-canonical route includes the activation of Ras/MAPK pathway as a result of phosphorylation and binding of TGF-beta receptor to Shc and consequently recruitment of Grb2 and Sos. TGF-beta-stimulated activation of Ras/MAPK pathway induces expression of genes involved in cell survival and growth. Dab2 modulates TGF-beta signaling by sequestering Grb2 from Sos, resulting in a reduction of Ras/MAPK activation yet allowing Smad-mediated gene transcription.</div></div>
