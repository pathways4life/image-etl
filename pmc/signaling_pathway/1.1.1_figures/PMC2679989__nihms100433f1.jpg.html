From: Function of Nod-like Receptors in Microbial Recognition and Host Defense. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The NLR Nod2 recognizes bacterial PGN fragments such as MDP and activates NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling via the indicated proteins leading to the transcriptional upregulation of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial peptides. Negative feedback regulation occurs upon induction of the deubiquitanase A20. The posttranslational regulation of various components of the pathway is indicated by green circles (phosphorylation) and red or blue circles (ubiquitination). In the case of RICK, K63-mediated polyubiquitination at K209 is essential for recruitment of Tak1. For NEMO, K48-mediated ubiquitination at residue K399 targets it for proteasome-dependent degradation. K63-linked polyubiquitination at amino acid K285 is important for complex formation with RICK (48).</div></div>
