The green arrow indicates the three known Unfolded Protein Response pathways mediated by transcription factors ATF4, ATF6 and XBP1. The predominant effect of these pathways is to induce quality control genes that help the cell survive ER stress. Although ATF4 induces CHOP that can aggravate stress, this aspect is a byproduct of a quality control enzyme, Ero-1L, involved in oxidative protein folding. The red arrow shows the newly discovered CDK5/MEKK1 pathway that mediates cell death in a Drosophila model for Autosomal Dominant Retinitis Pigmentosa.</div></div>
