IPA was performed on genes that were differentially up-regulated following virus infection (change, &gt;2-fold; P &lt; 0.001). IPA identified genes involved in IFN signaling (A), death receptor signaling (B), and IL-17RA signaling (C) as being common to infections with JEV, WNV, and reovirus. The charts are adapted from IPA results. Shaded boxes represent genes that were differentially up-regulated following virus infection.</div></div>
