From: Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)-related Non-kinase Inhibits Myofibroblast  Differentiation through Differential MAPK Activation in a FAK-dependent  Manner. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Hypothetical mechanism whereby FRNK inhibits TGF-β-induced  α-SMA expression in the presence and absence of FAK.</b>  TGF-β-induced α-SMA expression and myofibroblast differentiation  requires the involvement of multiple signaling initiated through the  integrins, extracellular matrix (ECM) environment, and TGF-β  receptors (TGF-βR). Recent evidence demonstrates that  certain integrins, in cooperation with the cytoskeleton, are capable of  activating latent TGF-β through binding to latency-associated protein  (21,  26,  68). TGF-β induces  α-SMA expression through two pathways; the major pathway through ERK  MAPK is FAK-dependent, and the minor pathway through p38 MAPK is  FAK-independent. FRNK can inhibit TGF-β-induced α-SMA expression  through inhibition of FAK activation and inhibition of the FAK/ERK-mediated  pathway. FRNK also can inhibit the pathway of TGF-β-induced α-SMA  expression mediated by p38, potentially through inhibition of critical  signaling proteins upstream of p38 (i.e. Src kinase).</div></div>
