The first experiment within each heatmap (from bottom to top) is the ‘control’ state; the miRNA effect and anti-miRNA effect of the different experiments is always compared versus the ‘control’ state. <b>A</b>: Quantitative changes of mir-489 direct target-proteins due to different amounts of anti-mir-489 per experiment. The inhibition effects of mir-489 is inversely correlated with the anti-mir-489 concentration. <b>B</b>: Quantitative changes of the EGFR downstream activated proteins according to different amounts of anti-mir-489 per experiment. The concentrations of many downstream activated proteins of the EGFR signaling pathway correlate with the concentration of anti-mir-489. <b>C</b>: Quantitative changes of mir-34a direct target-proteins due to different amounts of anti-mir-34a per experiment. The inhibition effects of mir-34a inversely correlate with the anti-mir-34a concentration. <b>D</b>: Quantitative changes of the EGFR downstream activated proteins according to different amounts of anti-mir-34a per experiment. The concentrations of many downstream activated proteins correlate with the anti-mir-34a concentration.</div></div>
