This leads to reduced iron storage and increased iron uptake, ultimately increasing the cellular iron pool and promoting survival during iron limitation. Insulin/insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) pathway: the IIS pathway is a conserved pathway in worms, flies and in vertebrates that regulates the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. DAF-16/FOXO regulates genes in essential processes, such as metabolism, stress resistance, pathogen defense and lifespan extension. Activated IIS initiates a phosphorylation cascade that leads to the cytoplasmic retention of DAF-16/FOXO and inhibits its function. Nutrient deprivation reduces IIS leading to the nuclear localization of DAF-16 to activate ftn-1. Glucose upregulates smf-3 expression, but whether DAF-16 directly regulates smf-3 remains to be determined. This pathway provides a mechanism to increase cellular iron by reducing ftn-1 when nutrients are abundant to promote growth and to reduce cellular iron during stress by increasing ftn-1 to limit iron-catalyzed oxidative stress.</div></div>
