(A)</b> Downregulation of miR-99a in response to IGF1 treatment. After serum starvation, cells were treated with vehicle, 10% FBS or 10 nM IGF1. <b>(B)</b> Immunoblot analysis revealed increased levels of IGF1R protein following IGF1-induced downregulation of miR-99a. After serum starvation, cells were treated with vehicle, 10% FBS or 10 nM IGF1. The protein levels were normalized against an internal control α-tubulin. Ratios were determined by dividing the normalized protein levels in OEC-M1 cells with different conditions to that in complete medium (CM). The means in the lower panel were measured by averaging the ratios from independent blots. <b>(C)</b> The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and <b>(D)</b> MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059 suppressed the IGF1-induced downregulation of miR-99a. After serum starvation, cells were treated with vehicle, 10 nM IGF1, or combination of LY294002/PD98059 and IGF1. Expression of miR-99a was normalized against an endogenous control U6. The relative expression of miR-99a was determined by normalizing the expression of miR-99a in OEC-M1 cells in different conditions to that in cells in complete medium (CM). Bar, SE; *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001. <b>(E)</b> Proposed model of the relationship between the activation of the IGF1R signaling pathway and miR-99a expression. The activation of the IGF1R signaling pathway initiated the inhibitory signal leading to decreased miR-99a expression. Following the suppression of the IGF1R signaling pathway by inhibitors, or its silencing by the removal of stimulation, we observed increased miR-99a expression because of the removal of the inhibitory signal. This reciprocal regulation of miR-99a and IGF1R signaling augmented the activation of the IGF1R signaling pathway in response to IGF1 stimulation and accelerated its inactivation following the removal of stimulation.</div></div>
