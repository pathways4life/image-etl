From: Fusion of the BCL9 HD2 domain to E1A increases the cytopathic effect of an oncolytic adenovirus that targets colon cancer cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Three possible examples of tumor-specific targeting using E1A fusion proteins</b>. In each case E1A is fused to a protein domain (X) that binds to a protein normally found at the promoter in increased amounts in tumor cells. Notch Pathway: in the absence of a signal, CSL recruits co-repressors; upon signaling, NotchIC is released, binds to CSL and activates transcription. Hedgehog pathway: in the absence of a signal, Cubitus Interruptus is cleaved to its repressor form; upon signaling, full-length Ci is produced and activates transcription. Hypoxia pathway: in normoxia, HIF1α is degraded; in hypoxia, HIF1α is stabilized, dimerizes with ARNT, binds to DNA and activates transcription.</div></div>
