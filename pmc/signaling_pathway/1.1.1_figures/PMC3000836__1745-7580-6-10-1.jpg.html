(A) Representation of the KEGG Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway. The TLR3 signal is highlighted in red. (B) Representation of the KEGG TLR3 pathway, displaying only the reactions proven in human DCs. The curation led to the validation of about 50% of the genes previously belonging to public TLR3 signaling.</div></div>
