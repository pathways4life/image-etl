(a) Vemurafenib causes cell death by inhibiting V600E BRAF kinase activity and signaling transduction through the MAPK pathway. (b) New mutations in the NRAS causes heterodimerization of BRAF/CRAF and reactivation of the signaling pathway. (c) and (d) Phosphorylation of ERK independent of RAF stimulation is the result of the overexpression of COT (c) and of the additional mutation in MEK kinase (d). (e) Overexpression of PDGFRÎ² can lead to resistance to vemurafenib treatment independent from the continuous inhibition of the MAPK pathway.</div></div>
