A model of the WNT Signaling pathway adapted from the curated KEGG pathway for M. musculus (Mmu) includes SRCs for Wnt, Frizzled, and Dishevelled pathway participants, illustrating that not all family members are equally supported by evidential data. Curated pathways, which are cell-type agnostic, cannot capture these differences in connectivity. A corresponding network of mESC posterior edges involved in this view of WNT Signaling (created in Cytoscape) demonstrates the variance in edge weights and SRCs in the signaling cascade. <b>B.</b> The same WNT Signaling subnetwork produced using Mmu superset and negative control posterior edge weights and SRCs captures a different picture of connectivity as compared to the mESC network. Far more WNT signaling activity between different WNT family member ligands and Frizzled receptors is evident in the test subnetworks. This may reflect WNT signaling activity observed in data from both mESCs and other cellular contexts in the Mmu superset of features. The influence of WNT signaling in other cellular contexts is even stronger in the negative control subnetwork.</div></div>
