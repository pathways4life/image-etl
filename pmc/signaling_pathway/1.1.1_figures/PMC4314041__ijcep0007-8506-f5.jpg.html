From: Placenta growth factor promotes migration through regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related protein expression in cervical cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PLGF regulated the EMT-related protein expression through ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. A. Application of a specific ERK/MAPK signaling pathway inhibitor, PD98059 (10 μmol/l), or application of a specific PI3k/Akt signaling pathway inhibitor, LY294002 (20 μmol/l), or a specific JNK pathway inhibitor, SP600125 (10 μmol/l) to siha cells before treated with PLGF. PD98059 substantially abolished the decrease of E-cadherin expression by Western blot. B. Application of only PD98059 significantly decreased the migration of siha cells in a transwell assay. *P &lt; 0.05.</div></div>
