Activated NF-κB-p50 and NF-κB-p65 proteins in cytoplasm are now free to move into nucleus where they can bind to the promoter of GRK5. This activated protein complex may interact with other transcription factors and coactivators in the promoter region, thereby enhancing the transcription of GRK5. This event can be blocked by inhibition of activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, such as by antioxidants.</div></div>
