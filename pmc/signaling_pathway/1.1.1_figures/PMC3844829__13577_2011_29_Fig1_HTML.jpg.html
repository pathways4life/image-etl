The genes are divided into indicated apoptosis pathways: the TNF receptor pathway, NKkB signaling pathway, Bcl-2 family-regulated pathway, CARD family, caspases, IAP family, and others. Differences in gene expression are presented as fold changes (compared to reference HUVECs), accompanied by corresponding p values (according to [36])</div></div>
