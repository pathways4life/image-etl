From: Coordinate Regulation of mRNA Decay Networks by GU-rich Elements and CELF1. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The network diagram depicts the coordinate regulation of GRE-containing transcripts involved in T cell receptor signaling. Transcripts in bold are GRE-containing. Transcripts in grey were identified as CELF1 targets in HeLa cells by RNA-IP [43].Transcripts in green represent short-lived GRE-containing transcripts expressed in primary human T cells [33], [37]. Transcripts labeled with an asterisk exhibited changes in steady state levels following T-cell receptor stimulation [33]. This network diagram was built using Ingenuity Pathway Assistant Software.</div></div>
