Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting, using phospho-specific antibodies, and β-actin served as a loading control. (A) Following stimulation with NGF or AβO1–40, p-Akt levels were 1.74±0.74 and 1.66±1.54 relative to controls, respectively. Induction of p-Akt by NGF was inhibited by LY294002. However, the AβO1–40-dependent phosphorylation of Akt was not inhibited by LY294002. Values are expressed as mean ± SD (relative to controls), *p&lt;0.05 (unpaired Student's t-test).
