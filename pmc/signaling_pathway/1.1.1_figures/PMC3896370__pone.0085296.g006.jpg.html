CDH17 indirectly affects integrins to stabilize their structure and activity. The up-regulation of cadherin-integrin signaling activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. The activation of ERK regulates various nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates, including p53 and p21, which involve in diverse cellular responses, such as cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, colony formation, cell-cycle and apoptosis.</div></div>
