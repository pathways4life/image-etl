Depending on the type of cell line studied, three main pathways have been shown to be activated in JSRV transformed cells; the PI3K/Akt pathway, the Hyal2-RON pathway, and the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway. Signaling through the TLR4-NFkB pathway is also depicted, since the JSRV Env interacts with TLR4, though activation of this pathway has yet to be formally shown. A fourth pathway; via signaling through Rac1, has recently been identified, but less is known about it [86]. Except for the Hyal2-RON pathway, how the JSRV Env engages the Ras-MEK-ERK or the PI3K/Akt pathways is not known. Possible interactions, or yet to be identified factors that may be involved in JSRV Env-mediated transformation, are indicated with question marks (?). Each pathway involved in JSRV Env-transformation leads to the activation of factors involved in cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. See text for details.</div></div>
