Selenite treatment inhibited Src/PI3K/PDK1/AKT pathway and accumulation of FoxO3a in the nucleus possibly through induced ROS in CRC cells. On one hand, upregulated FoxO3a enhanced the transcription and expression of bim, which led to apoptosis. Additionally, PTEN was also upregulated by FoxO3a, indicating further regulation of AKT/FoxO3a/Bim signaling and apoptosis in response to selenite</div></div>
