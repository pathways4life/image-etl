TGF-β ligand is secreted as a latent precursor protein, bound to LAP. Activation of TGF-β involves cleavage of LAP from the ligand, which then binds to the type II receptor, and drives hetero-tetramerization with the type I receptor. The canonical signaling pathway involves phosphorylation of R-Smads (mainly Smad2 and Smad3) by activated TβRI. Phosphorylated R-Smads form a complex with the Co-Smad (Smad4), which translocates into the nucleus to bind gene promoters and activate expression of target genes. There are several non-canonical (non-Smad) signaling pathways, whereby TGF-β signals through the TGF-β receptors to activate TGF-β activated kinase 1 (Tak1), Ras and PI3K as well as other pathways.</div></div>
