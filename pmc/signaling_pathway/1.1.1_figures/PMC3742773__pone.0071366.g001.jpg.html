Fold changes and p values were calculated using Studentâ€™s t-test. A p value&lt;0.05 and a fold change greater than 2.0 were considered to be a significant dysregulation. Figure 1A is a list of up regulated and down regulated genes with fold-change greater than 2. The heat-map (Figure 1B) and scatter plot (Figure 1C) generated are also shown.</div></div>
