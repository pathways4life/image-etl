Cells were treated with 15 ng/mL of EGF for the indicated periods of time ((a), (b), (e)) or incubated with or without AG1478 or wortmannin for 1 h and then exposed to 15 ng/mL of EGF for the indicated periods of time ((c), (d), (f)). After treatment, cells were harvested for Western blotting analysis using specific antibodies as indicated, and β-actin was used as an equal loading control.</div></div>
