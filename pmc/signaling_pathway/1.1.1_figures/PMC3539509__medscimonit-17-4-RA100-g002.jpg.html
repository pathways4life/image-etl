From: Toll-like receptor and its roles in myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">TLR4 signaling pathway: TLR4 is localized on cell surface for ligand recognition and activates both MyD88-dependent pathway and TRIF-dependent pathway. In MyD88-dependent pathway, TLR4 recruits MAL to link TIR domain of TLR4 with MyD88. MyD88 recruits the IRAK family of proteins and TRAF6. TRAF6 activates TAK1. The activated TAK1 not only activates the IKK complex activating NF-κB, also activates the MAPKs. In TRIF-dependent pathway, TLR4 recruits. TRAM to link TIR domain of TLR4 with TRIF. TRIF interacts with RIP1 and TRAF6, which could activate NF-κB and MAPKs; TRIF interacts with TRAF3 and activates TRAF3/IKKɛ which activates IRF3 and IRF7.</div></div>
