From: OVARIAN CANCER. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">This cell signaling pathway is important for the cellular response to a variety of growth and differentiation factors. Aberration of this pathway in ovarian SBTs and low-grade serous carcinomas is mainly due to activating mutations of KRAS and BRAF, which result in constitutive activation of MAPK-mediated signaling in these tumors. Activated MAPK signaling alters expression of downstream target genes, including up-regulation of cyclin D1. Several MEK small compound inhibitors such as CI-1040 have been generated. These inhibitors effectively suppress MAPK activation and hold promise for treatment of patients with advanced stage low-grade serous carcinomas.</div></div>
