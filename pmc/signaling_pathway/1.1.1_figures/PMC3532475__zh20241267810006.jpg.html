Diagram of mammalian Wnt signaling pathway superimposed on oligonucleotide-based chip data at 14 days after UUO. Downregulated genes are displayed in green and upregulated genes are displayed in red. A: illustration of Wnt signaling pathway. B: gene expression of KLTG sham compared with WT sham. C: gene expression of WT UUO compared with WT sham. D: gene expression of KLTG UUO compared with KLTG sham. Six samples in each group were mixed and used for microarray analysis.</div></div>
