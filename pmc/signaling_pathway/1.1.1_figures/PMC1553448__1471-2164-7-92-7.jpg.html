Decorin, a negative regulator of TGFÎ² signaling, is produced by stromal cells, which may result in autocrine regulation of the pathway. BMP4 and BMP5 are produced by stromal cells and may be responsible for paracrine regulation of Inhibitor of Differentiation (ID) gene expression in the prostate.</div></div>
