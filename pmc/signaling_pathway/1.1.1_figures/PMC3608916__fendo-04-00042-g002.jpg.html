IGF-I at 2â€‰nM was tested in addition to increasing amounts of synthetic E-peptides. Both EA and EB showed a dose-dependent augmentation of IGF-IR phosphorylation compared to IGF-I alone. Data taken from Brisson and Barton (2012). <b>(B)</b> Normal conditions when IGF-I is added to myoblasts, activating IGF-IR, and leading to increases in MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling. <b>(C)</b> When IGF-I is present, synthetic E-peptides increase receptor activation and tune downstream signaling toward the MAPK pathway. <b>(D)</b> Pro-IGF-I leads to more IGF-IR phosphorylation than mature IGF-I alone, but the consequences on downstream signaling are unknown. <b>(E)</b> E-peptide MAPK activation is inhibited via NVP AEW541, an IGF-IR inhibitor. <b>(F)</b> E-peptide IGF-IR augmentation requires IGF-I.</div></div>
