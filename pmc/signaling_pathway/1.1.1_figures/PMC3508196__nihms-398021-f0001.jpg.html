From: TARGETING ONCOGENIC BRAF IN HUMAN CANCER. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The MAP kinase pathway is activated in human tumors by the binding of ligand to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), by constitutive activation of an RTK, by loss of NF1 function, or by mutations in RAS, BRAF and MEK1. Phosphorylation and thus activation of ERK regulates transcription of target genes which promote cell cylce progression and tumor survival. The ERK pathway contains a classical feedback loop in which the expression of feedback elements such as SPRY and DUSP family proteins are regulated by ERK (dashed grey lines). Selected agents that target the MAP kinase and PI3 kinase/AKT pathway are shown (red).</div></div>
