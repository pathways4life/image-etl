Afferent corticostriatal and nigro-striatal projections modulate striatal signaling, which is impaired in Huntington’s Disease (HD). Neurotrophic factor BDNF release from cortical afferences is decreased in cortico-striatal synapses as a consequence of Exp-HTT-mediated down-regulation of bdnf transcription and axonal transport in cortical neurons. A shift from synaptic to extrasynaptic NMDAR-dependent signaling participates to striatal neurons to death. In a physiological condition, calcium influx through synaptic NMDAR promotes activation of the MAPkinase/ERK signaling pathway along with its nuclear target, the MSK-1 protein, which phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB. MSK-1 activation promotes chromatin remodeling, which is crucial for CREB-mediated pgc-1α transcription, a key gene involved in mitochondria biogenesis. Synaptic NMDARs also promote formation of non-toxic Exp-HTT inclusion via TRIC. In HD, localization and activity of extrasynaptic NMDAR are enhanced by Exp-HTT, which promotes neuronal cell injury and death. The toxic effect of extrasynaptic NMDAR is partly due to (i) the upregulation of Rhes expression that disaggregates the non-toxic Exp-HTT inclusions (ii) to an impairment of mitochondrial functions and (iii) to a decrease of the ERK/MSK-1/CREB signaling module to the pgc-1α promoter. Dopamine release from nigro-striatal inputs promotes oxidative stress via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which potentiates activation of the pro-apoptotic JNK pathway induced by Exp-HTT. In addition, Dopamine potentiates Exp-HTT-mediated striatal neurons death through activation of the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway downstream D2R.</div></div>
