From: Crosstalk between NOTCH and AKT <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> during murine megakaryocyte lineage specification. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Schematic representation of the crosstalk between the NOTCH and AKT pathways at the molecular and cellular levels.</b> (A) Scheme of the molecular pathways. NOTCH pathway activation inhibits PTEN expression leading to AKT activation, FOXO phosphorylation, and enhanced RBPJ-mediated transcription. We hypothesize that this regulatory loop links cytokine receptor signaling and RBPJ-mediated transcription. (B) Scheme of the megakaryocyte lineage development pathways. Our results support the hypothesis that megakaryocyte can develop from immature hematopoietic cells through a NOTCH-induced AKT-independent pathway. Megakaryocyte can also develop from committed myeloid progenitor through an AKT-dependent pathway that is activated by cytokine receptor activation (eg, MPL) and may also be stimulated by the NOTCH signaling.</div></div>
