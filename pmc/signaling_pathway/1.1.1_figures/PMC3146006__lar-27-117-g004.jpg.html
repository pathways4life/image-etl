Total cell lysates were prepared from INS cells treated with vehicle, KWG, KRG and six different LPs prepared under different steaming conditions, as described in the Materials and Methods sections. Fifty micrograms of protein per sample were immunoblotted with antibodies for each protein. Three samples were assayed in triplicate via Western blotting. The values are expressed as the means±SD. *P&lt;0.05 is the significance level compared to the vehicle-treated group.</div></div>
