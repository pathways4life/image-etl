H7 human ES cells were differentiated for 19 days before Percoll separation, and fraction IV cells were cultured for an additional 4 days in serum-free media with various signaling inhibitors. The inhibitors were added for the final 48 hours of culture prior to fixation. Only the PI 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002) significantly inhibited human ES cell-derived cardiomyocyte proliferation (* = P &lt; 0.05).</div></div>
