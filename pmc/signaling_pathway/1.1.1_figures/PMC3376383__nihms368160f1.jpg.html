The sterile 20 kinase Tao-1 directly phosphorylates Hippo and MST kinases in vitro and promotes pathway activation in vivo. The scaffolding proteins Salvador/WW45 and Mats/Mob promote Hippo/MST and Warts/Lats kinase activity, respectively. Hippo/MST phosphorylates Warts/Lats, which in turn phosphorylates Yorkie/Yap to promote 14-3-3 binding. 14-3-3 sequesters Yorkie/Yap in the cytoplasm, preventing the transcription of target genes that promote tissue growth. In addition, Fat signaling (not shown) has been shown to regulate Warts stability and Yorkie activation in parallel to Hippo.</div></div>
