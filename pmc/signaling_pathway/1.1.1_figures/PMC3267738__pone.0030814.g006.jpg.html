(<b>B</b>) Membrane targeting of the cytoplasmic moiety of LRP5 (MF-LRP5) and three variants containing mutations of possible phosphorylation sites: (1) YSS→FAA, (2) YRPY→FLPF and (3) YSS→FAA and YRPY→FLPF. The mutants have reduced Wnt pathway inducibility. Western blot indicates comparable protein expression from respective TCF-SEAP assay. (<b>C</b>) Comparison of iLRP5 and iLRP5 mutants. YSS→FAA and YRPY→FLPF mutants have lower TCF-SEAP activity. The double mutant fails to activate Wnt signaling. Western blot indicates protein expression from respective TCF-SEAP assay. (B and C), Data representative of two separate experiments performed in triplicates.</div></div>
