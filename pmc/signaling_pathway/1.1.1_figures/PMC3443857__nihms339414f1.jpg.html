Ihh is a progesterone target activated within the epithelium which signals downstream to COUP-TFII in the stroma establishing the Ihhâ€“COUP-TFII axis within the dual uterine compartments. COUP-TFII has demonstrated to be a critical effector of decidualization and the maintenance of pregnancy during post-implantation through the activation of Bmp2 and Wnt4. COUP-TFII may also play a role in the activation of Hand2 in the stroma leading to the inhibition of the FGF pathway, a pathway known to be involved in the promotion of epithelial proliferation by estrogen signaling. The arrows represent activation. The bars denote inhibition. The question marks next to arrows represent an activation that is lacking substantial evidence.</div></div>
