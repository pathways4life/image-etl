In this condition Raf-1 is repressed by RKIP and only marginally participates in the signaling. <b>(B)</b> When B-Raf is depleted or deficient, signaling through MAPK is severely hindered since RKIP prevents full activation of Raf-1 and downstream phosphorylation of ERK. <b>(C)</b> When RKIP and B-Raf are deficient or depleted, signaling to ERK occurs through Raf-1. The thickness of the blue arrows is proportional to the intensity of the signaling.</div></div>
