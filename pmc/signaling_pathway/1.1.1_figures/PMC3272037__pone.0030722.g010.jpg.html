From: Diet and Energy-Sensing Inputs Affect TorC1-Mediated Axon Misrouting but Not TorC2-Directed Synapse Growth in a Drosophila Model of Tuberous Sclerosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A schematic diagram illustrating the effects of Tor-signaling elements on axon guidance and synapse growth. Rheb-mediated axon misrouting defects are dependent on signaling through TorC1 and S6k, and can be rescued by diet restriction or AMPK expression. Axon guidance is largely insensitive to changes in Pi3K. Synapse overgrowth mediated by Rheb overexpression is dependent on signaling through TorC2, is not rescued by caloric restriction or AMPK activation, and is exacerbated by knockdown of S6k, suggesting the removal of a feedback inhibition. Synapse overgrowth is also induced by Pi3K overexpression, similarly to Rheb.</div></div>
