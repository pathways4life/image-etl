Significance was assessed using the two-sample t test of log-transformed values. B, immunohistochemical staining for IRS1 expression in ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinomas with or without the activated β-catenin signaling pathway. Tumor samples were subdivided into samples showing inactivation of PTEN or not.</div></div>
