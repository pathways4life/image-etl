TLR4 requires four signaling adaptors to function upon activation by LPS. Similarly to TLR2 it uses MAL to recruit MyD88 and to activate the NFκB pathway and p38 and JNK MAPK pathways. A second signaling cascade triggered by the LPS-TLR4 interaction involves TRAM. TRAM recruits TRIF which activates pathways involving TBK1 to IRF3, TRAF6 to NFκB and RIP1 to apoptosis.</div></div>
