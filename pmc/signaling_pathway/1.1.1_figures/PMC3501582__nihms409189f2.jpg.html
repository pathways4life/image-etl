In the absence of Shh, Ptch 1 suppresses signaling by smoothened (Smo). Binding of Shh to Ptch 1 relieves this inhibition. Activation of Smo leads to the activation and translocation of transcription factors of the Gli family into the nucleus, with subsequent changes in gene expression.</div></div>
