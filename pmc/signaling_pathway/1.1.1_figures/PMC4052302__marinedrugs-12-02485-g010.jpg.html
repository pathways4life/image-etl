TLR4 is activated by LPS, which in turn triggers both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent TRIF-dependent pathways. Signaling through the MyD88-dependent pathway is responsible for early phase nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation that facilitates the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The TRIF-dependent pathway activates IRF3, which culminates in the induction of IFN-β- and IFN-inducible genes. This pathway also helps in secondary NF-κB and MAPK activation that reinforces the defense response.</div></div>
