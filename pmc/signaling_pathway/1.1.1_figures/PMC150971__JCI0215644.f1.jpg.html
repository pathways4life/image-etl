Upon binding ligand, receptor-associated JAKs become activated and mediate phosphorylation of specific receptor tyrosine residues. This leads to the recruitment of specific STATs, which are then also tyrosine-phosphorylated. Activated STATs are released from the receptor, dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to members of the Î³-activated site (GAS) family of enhancers.</div></div>
