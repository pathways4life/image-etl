Rising the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ results in the activation of downstream signaling that regulates granule movement to the MTOC. In contrast, MTOC translocation is Ca2+-independent and is primarily mediated by DAG-dependent signaling. A faster Ca2+ signaling in more effective CTL stimulates swift granule movement towards the MTOC and the granules are concentrated near the MTOC prior to MTOC polarization. The MTOC then directly delivers granules to the secretory domain – the short path. A slower Ca2+ signaling in less effective CTL results in a delay in granule recruitment and granules move along the microtubules to the periphery of the synapse looping through the pSMAC – a longer path. MTOC polarization to the mature synapse also requires F-actin remodeling and segregation as well as the recruitment of ADAP-associated dynein to the periphery of the actin ring. Vav-dependent downstream signaling plays a critical role in regulating these molecular events. Cartoons at the upper and bottom left are courtesy of Christoph Schmutte.</div></div>
