From: Complexity in Biological <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Systems. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Four major signaling pathways in the postsynaptic region of a neuron that combine to form a local signaling network. The major linear routes of signal flow are depicted by the thick arrows of four different colors: orange [phospholipase C (PLC) pathway], pink (Ras pathway), green (adenylyl cyclase pathway), and blue [Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) pathway]. The interactions between different pathways are represented by black lines with arrow (representing activation) or a dot (representing inhibition). Although most major interactions in the network are shown, these connections are not meant to be all-inclusive; additional connections could exist. The three-colored background represents three different cell compartments: the plasma membrane (light yellow), cytosol (light blue), and nucleus (light green). Some of the signaling proteins that translocate between different compartments are shown in both compartments. Examples include MAP kinase, which when activated translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to phosphorylate and activate transcription factors; and the transcription factor CREB, which upon phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) translocates to the nucleus.</div></div>
