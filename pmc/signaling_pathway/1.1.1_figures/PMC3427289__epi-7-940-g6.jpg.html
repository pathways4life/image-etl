Transfection of miR-29a and miR-1256 mimic into PCa cells, and isoflavone treatment significantly inhibited cell growth (A) and invasion (B) of PCa cells (*: p &lt; 0.05; n = 3). Microarray and Ingenuity Pathway analysis showed that isoflavone downregulated TRIM68/AR and PGK-1 signaling (C; Green: downregulated; Red: upregulated).</div></div>
