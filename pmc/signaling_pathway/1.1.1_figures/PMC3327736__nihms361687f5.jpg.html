Genetic perturbations tie the Msn2/4 noise regulon to PKA <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and demonstrate that mean expression of a <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> and covariance within a <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> have a complex relationship.

Error bars represent standard error of means (n=6)(b) Covariance of Pgm2 and Arg4 as a function of mean Pgm2 expression as the levels of Msn2 are varied. Overexpression of constitutively active Msn2 to various levels results in a log-linear increase in covariance between Arg4 and Pgm2 as a function of Pgm2, and non-loglinear increase in covariance between Pgm2 and Hsp12, two proteins whose genes promoters are targets of Msn2. Error bars represent standard error of means (n=3).</div></div>
