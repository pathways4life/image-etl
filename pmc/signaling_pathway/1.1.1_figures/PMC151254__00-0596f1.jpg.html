Secondary signaling molecules can cause receptor-mediated Ca2+ release (indicated with a feedback arrow). Examples of signaling partners that modulate the main pathway are also shown. These partners can be regulated by the main pathway. Signaling can also bypass Ca2+ or secondary signaling molecules in early signaling steps. GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; InsP, inositol polyphosphates; RLK, receptor-like kinase. Other abbreviations are given in the text.</div></div>
