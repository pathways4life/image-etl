In the canonical pathway, activated Smad2/3 form a complex with Smad4, translocates into the nucleus, and binds to SBE site at −445 of the Csrp2 promoter. In the non-canonical pathway, following TβRII binding of TGFβ, TβRII (without the requirement of TβRII’s cytoplasmic kinase domain) activates Src family kinase (SFK), which in turn activates RhoA. Enhanced RhoA activation leads to ROCK activation and increased JNK phosphorylation, resulting in enhanced ATF2 phosphorylation. Activated ATF2 dimer binds to CRE site at −461. The two signaling pathways (ATF2 and Smad) converge on the CRE and SBE sites of the Csrp2 promoter to cooperatively control CRP2 induction in VSMCs, which represents a previously unrecognized mechanism of VSMC gene induction by TGFβ.</div></div>
