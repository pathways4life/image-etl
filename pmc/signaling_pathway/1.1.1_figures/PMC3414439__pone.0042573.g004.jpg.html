Network map of halofantrine and vinblastine on triple-negative breast cancer using phExplorer..  From: CDA: Combinatorial Drug Discovery Using Transcriptional Response Modules. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) It seems that halofantrine and vinblastine could affect on five different signaling pathways in TNBC. Group 5: Halofantrine- or vinblatine-related proteins which are also related with proteins of A6B1 and A6B4 Integrin signaling pathway. Group 6: Proteins which are related with vinblasitne as well as proteins of EGFR family signaling pathways (such as ERBB1 signaling pathway, ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling events, ERBB4 signaling events, ERBB receptor signaling network). (B) We hypnotized that halofantrine and vinblastine are synergistic because they complementary regulate integrin and EGFR signaling pathways. Group 0: A part of EGFR family signaling pathways. Group 1: A part of A6B1 and A6B4 Integrin signaling pathway.</div></div>
