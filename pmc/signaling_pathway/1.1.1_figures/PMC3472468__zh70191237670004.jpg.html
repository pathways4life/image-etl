Genes regulated by sleep deprivation mapped to the insulin signaling pathway (adapted from KEGG and Wikipathways). Upregulated gene names are written in lower case, in bold and italics, and downregulated gene names are written in bold with underlining. Note that genes from several functional clusters and enriched pathways shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2 are contained within this signaling network.</div></div>
