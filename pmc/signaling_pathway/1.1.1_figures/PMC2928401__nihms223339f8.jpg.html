From: Identification of Primary Gene Targets of TFAP2C in Hormone Responsive Breast Carcinoma Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The 447 TFAP2C target genes were analyzed using Ingenuity Systems to determine associations between genes for the purpose of defining physiologic pathways regulated by TFAP2C. The main pathway (with the greatest number of genes) is shown and was characterized as involved in cell growth and proliferation. Prominent genes noted in this network include MYC, ESR1 and ERK. Red tone indicates genes repressed by TFAP2C and green indicates genes induced by TFAP2C. <b>Inset:</b> Retinoic acid signaling pathway was also identified as a prominent network involved with TFAP2C target genes, RXR, RAR and CRABP2.</div></div>
