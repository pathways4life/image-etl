B, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression vectors for 4XCSL-Luc, Hes1-Luc, Hes5-Luc, and β-galactosidase, along with ΔEN1 and Fe65, as indicated. A and B, after 48 h of transfection, the cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was determined. The data were normalized with β-galactosidase. These results represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. R.L.U., relative luciferase units. The data we evaluated for significant difference by Student's t test. *, p &lt; 0.01 (analysis of variance).</div></div>
