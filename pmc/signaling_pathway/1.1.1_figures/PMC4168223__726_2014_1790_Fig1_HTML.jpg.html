Western blot analysis of phosphorylation status of selected proteins of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in HT-29 cells after treatment with KYNA 1 mM for 5 min–48 h (<b>a</b>) and treatment with KYNA in the range of concentrations 0.01–5 mM for 4, 24 and 48 h or 24 and 48 h (<b>b</b>); (C control; not treated). Western blots shown in the figure were selected as the most representative of the series of repetitions n ≥ 3. The data were normalized relative to β-actin. The results of densitometric analysis are shown as % of control (the changes ≥20 % were considered as significant)</div></div>
