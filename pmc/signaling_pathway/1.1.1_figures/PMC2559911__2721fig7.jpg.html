Upon DAF-2 activation, AGE-1 and PIP3 activate PDK-1 and the downstream kinase complex AKT-1/AKT-2/SGK-1. The transcription factor DAF-16 is directly inhibited and phosphorylated via activity of the IIS pathway, a function of which is induction of stress response and longevity genes. In addition, DAF-16 integrates positive signals via JNK signaling stimulating nuclear accumulation. Genetic and biochemical analyses presented here suggest that SHC-1 opposes IIS upstream of AGE-1 and DAF-2 and directly interacts with DAF-2. Furthermore, SHC-1 activates JNK signaling and interacts with MEK-1 to control life span and response against heat, oxidation, and heavy metals.</div></div>
