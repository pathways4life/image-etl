The activity of PAMH is blocked by staurosporin and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG490, implicating serine, threonine kinases, and tyrosine kinases, respectively, in the signaling pathway controlled by PAMH. PAMH drives nuclear export of HDAC5 and nuclear import of NFATc and stimulates the expression of MCIP1 and other genes involved in cardiac growth and remodeling. Signaling events that appear to play dominant roles in PAMH signaling are shown in bold. Those that are documented, but for which the relative importance remains to be established, are shown by thin lines, and those that remain hypothetical are shown by dashed lines. Prohypertrophic effectors are in green, and antihypertrophic effectors are in red.</div></div>
