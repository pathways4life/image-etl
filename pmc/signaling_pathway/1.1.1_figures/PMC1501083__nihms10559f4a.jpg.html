From: Parallel analysis of transcript and translation profiles: identification of metastasis-related signal pathways differentially regulated by drug and genetic modifications. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Response profiles of the Akt, caspase-dependent apoptosis, and Stat signaling pathways to caffeine treatments and genetic variations. The expression of the proteins in the Akt pathway (A1 and A2), caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway (B1 and B2), and Stats signaling pathway (C1 and C2) were determined using Western blot. The signal intensity of the target proteins was normalized against the signal intensity of GAPDH. Significant effects of caffeine exposure and genetic variations were observed in all 3 pathways. The relative abundance of protein expression (Perturbed/Control) in each pathway was plotted to provide an overview in the similarity of genetic and drug modifications on each pathway. The profiles of all 4 groups are similar in Stats signaling pathway (C2), however, inconsistent in the Akt pathway (A2) and caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway (B2). The metastatic phenotype of each group is indicated as H (high) or L (low).</div></div>
