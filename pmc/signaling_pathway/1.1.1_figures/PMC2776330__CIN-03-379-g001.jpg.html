The EGFR pathway could be disrupted by an increased expression of growth factor ligands. By targeting EGFR with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and MAb (monoclonal antibodies), EGFR activity can be eliminated. However, a downstream factor (e.g. MAPK signaling pathway) may also be activated to disrupt the pathway, thus making TKIs ineffective. Pathway data was obtained and selected from the Cancer Cell Map database and drawn using Cytoscape.</div></div>
