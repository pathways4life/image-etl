This accounts for majority of signal transduction events. However, NF-induced, but NFP-independent signaling responses suggest the existence of other receptor complexes. Differential transcriptional regulation of these candidate genes by both NF and GSE in NFP-independent manner suggests the existence of Myc factor receptor, which is capable of perceiving NF. Interestingly, NFP-independent, but NF-specific transcriptional responses suggest the existence of NF-specific “cryptic” signaling receptor in Medicago. Although a majority of these transcriptional responses are dependent on DMI3, GSE-induced DMI3-independent transcriptional regulation of candidate genes, suggest the existence of parallel signaling pathway, which is independent of well established signaling pathway comprising DMI genes.</div></div>
