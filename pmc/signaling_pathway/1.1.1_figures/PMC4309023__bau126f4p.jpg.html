(<b>A</b>) and (<b>B</b>) show the comparison of the number of molecular species and interactions of Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathway across different databases, respectively. The names of the databases are presented along the X-axis with their corresponding version number (if available), mentioned in first parenthesis. Pathway statistics presented in these graphs (Y-axis) are taken from those corresponding database versions, i.e. on or before 21 July 2014. The blue arrows indicating the names of the pathway databases signify that these databases do not possess Hedgehog or Notch pathway information. Moreover, the databases indicated by red arrows show the databases that do not possess their own curated Hedgehog or Notch pathway data. These types of databases (e.g. WikiPathways, hiPathDB and GOLD.db) are mostly dependent on the curated data of other databases and therefore the data from these databases are not included in the comparisons. Although these databases possess the same data, which is available in other databases, but the importance of such databases are found in other aspects of pathway data analysis. (<b>C</b>) The total number of signaling pathways of each database is plotted and compared. Here, the black arrows indicate the names of the databases whose total number of available signaling pathway data could not be counted. It shows hiPathDB has highest number of available pathway data present in its database, though the data it contains are all gathered from KEGG, REACTOME and NCI-PID.</div></div>
