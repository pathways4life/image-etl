From: T Cell Aging: A Review of the Transcriptional Changes Determined from Genome-Wide Analysis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Age-related alteration of gene expression in the TCR signaling pathway</b>. The age-related genes were assembled from the literature based on the significant changes reported by the original articles which were applied for all figures (Chen et al., 2003; Mo et al., 2003; Yung and Mo, 2003; Fann et al., 2005; Czesnikiewicz-Guzik et al., 2008; Henson and Akbar, 2009; Lazuardi et al., 2009; Weng et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2010; Hernandez-Lopez et al., 2010; Alonso-Arias et al., 2011; Mirza et al., 2011; Cane et al., 2012). Three-hundred five up-regulated and 472 down-regulated genes in aged human T cells including CD4 and CD8 T cells were analyzed using KEGG analysis in the WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt). The entire TCR signaling pathway is included and the molecules with lower gene expression compared with young are highlighted in red text and different border color indicating specific T cell subsets. The altered expressed genes in the TCR signaling pathway include CD3G, LCK, GRAP2 (encode GADS), GRB2, ITK, NCK, MAPK signaling pathway molecules SOS2 and MAPK1 (encode Erk), CD28, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway molecules PI3K, PDK1, and AKT, DLG1 (encode DLGH1) and MAPK14 (encode p38).</div></div>
