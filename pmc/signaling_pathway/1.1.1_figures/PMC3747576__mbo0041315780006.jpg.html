(A) Representation of the unperturbed urokinase pathway signaling pathway. (B) Without the presence of Serpine1, an inhibitor of both PLAU/urokinase and PLAT/tPA, there is increased cleavage of plasminogen into the active plasmin and thus increased breakdown of fibrin clots and hemorrhage compared to an unperturbed system. Red T shapes indicate inhibition, and blue arrows indicate activation.</div></div>
