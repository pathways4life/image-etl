S. cerevisiae carries the genes TOR1 and TOR2. TOR signaling is activated in response to nitrogen or inhibited due to cellular exposure to nitrogen limitations or synthetically to the agent rapamycin. Rapamycin binds to the prolyl-isomerase enzyme FKBP12. Binding of FKBP12 and thus inhibition of Tor leads to Slt2/Mpk1 phosphorylation. In this process, the Tor/FKBP12 complex prevents Tap42, a type 2A phosphatase-associated protein that binds to Sit4, a type 2A-related serine threonine phosphatase, from inhibiting Rom2. As a likely recipient of TOR signaling, Rom2 stimulates the CWI pathway in a PKC pathway-dependent manner that leads to Slt2/Mpk1 activation.</div></div>
