UNI harbors a CC (coiled-coil) domain, an NB (nucleotide-binding-site) domain and an LRR (leucine-rich repeat) domain. A ligand or an elicitor for activation of UNI proteins have not yet been identified. The ERECTA (ER) family members encode LRR (leucine-rich-repeat) receptor-like kinases in a subfamily of transmembrane-type receptors. Information about co-receptors that might form receptor complexes with ER-family members in UNI-related signaling and also about ligands for such receptor complexes is still lacking. Activities of ER-family members in UNI-expressing cells are required for uni-1D/+ phenotypes and also for modulation of cytokinin-related pathway.</div></div>
