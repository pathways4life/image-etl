From: Antagonistic Regulation of Cell-Matrix Adhesion by FosB and ?FosB/?2?FosB Encoded by Alternatively Spliced Forms of fosB Transcripts. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Signaling pathway for proceeding from FosB or ΔFosB/Δ2ΔFosB toward thrombospondin 1/TGF-β1, which regulates cell-matrix adhesion. Thrombospondin 1/TGF-β1 signaling, which may be negatively regulated by Jun/Fos complexes (active AP-1), enhances cell-matrix adhesion and up-regulates genes for basement membrane proteins through fosB gene expression. ΔFosB and Δ2ΔFosB antagonize not only FosB but also other Fos family members (Fos) constituting the major AP-1 complexes with the three Jun proteins (Jun), and they may up-regulate the TGF-β1 signaling pathway independent of intrinsic AP-1 activity. See details in the text and Supplemental Figure S2. Red represents up-regulated genes and blue indicates down-regulated genes.</div></div>
