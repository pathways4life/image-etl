Gene expression analysis of BMP and Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways in hMSCs on topographic surfaces and planar control at day 3.  From: Modulation of osteogenic differentiation in hMSCs cells by submicron topographically-patterned ridges and grooves. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Expression of ID1, a downstream gene of the BMP pathway (A), and TCF3 (B) and AXIN2 (C), downstream genes of the Wnt signaling pathway, was measured by quantitative PCR. The expression of each gene was first normalized to the expression of endogenous control TBP, and then normalized to the planar control. No significant increase in BMP or Wnt signaling pathways was noted in hMSCs under growth medium condition. All data are presented as the mean Â± SEM.</div></div>
