Resistance mechanisms originating from EGFR downstream effectors.  From: Targeting EGFR resistance networks in Head and Neck Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Cell signaling effectors downstream of EGFR may mitigate the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors by maintaining signaling activity to drive cell cycle progression and inhibit apoptosis. Increased signaling of the PI3K-Akt pathway, STAT proteins and cell cycle progression mediators such as Cyclin D1 have been association with resistance to EGFR inhibitors in SCCHN.
