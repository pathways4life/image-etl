From: Mammalian target of rapamycin regulates murine and human cell differentiation through STAT3/p63/Jagged/Notch cascade. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(<b>A</b>) Human breast (MCF7 and MDA-MB-468), prostate (PC3), lung (A549), pancreatic (PANC-1), and liver (HepG2) cancer cell lines were treated with 10 nM rapamycin for 24 hours and then subjected to immunoblotting for components of the mTOR/STAT/p63/Notch signaling pathway. (<b>B</b>) PC3 cells were transduced with either pLXIN-hyg retroviruses (V) or pLXIN-hyg-PTEN retroviruses (PTEN) and then subjected to immunoblotting for PTEN and mTOR/STAT/p63/Notch signaling pathway components. (<b>C</b>) Human breast cancer tissues were immunoblotted for components of the mTOR/STAT/p63/Notch signaling cascade. A representative blot is shown. The differentiation states (Diff.) of cancer cells were as indicated.    </div></div>
