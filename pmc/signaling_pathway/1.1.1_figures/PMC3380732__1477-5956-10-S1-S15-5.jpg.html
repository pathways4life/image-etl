(a) Network with 16 nodes extracted from the extended MAPK signaling pathway. The three nodes (in green) are the original nodes from the pathway. The TFs (squares) and microRNAs (triangles) that target them are also included. Due to the small size of the network the marginals were computed precisely. (b) Approximation of the marginal after different sample sizes of the Gibbs sampler. It can be seen that after 4,000 samples the error stays below 0.05.</div></div>
