A signaling cascade involving Salvador, Hippo, and Warts controls phosphorylation and nuclear localization of the transcription factors Yorkie (YKI) and TAZ to regulate epithelial growth. Epithelial integrity is monitored by cell-adhesion complexes (E-cadherin, Î±-catenin) and by the Par and Crumbs polarity complexes through the adaptor Kibra. The extracellular matrix (ECM) also has an impact on YKI nuclear localization through the Rho GTPase, independently of the Hippo pathway.</div></div>
