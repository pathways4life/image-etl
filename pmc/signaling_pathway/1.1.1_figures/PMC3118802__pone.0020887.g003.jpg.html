A schematic figure illustrating progressive activation of a prototype toxicity <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>, with attendant discrete phenotypic transitions..  From: Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: Defining New Risk Assessment Approaches Based on Perturbation of Intracellular Toxicity Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Text on right of figure shows proposed approaches for characterizing discrete transitions through multiple cellular phenotypes, i.e., (1) basal function, (2) minimally perturbed cellular states, (3) upregulation of adaptive, homeostatic gene batteries, and finally (4) overtly adverse states with excessive pathway perturbations. The structure of the circuitry with various embedded, nonlinear feedback loops is schematized in the middle panels. In the context of in vitro assay design, varying free concentrations of a test compound in the test media lead to increasing activation of pathway component (signaling protein) A, thereby driving pathway perturbations of signaling components B and C, and further signaling events downstream of C. Each of these steps is expected to be associated with specific alterations in gene expression, phenotypic read-out and pathway activation, identified by CSBP modeling. As the concentration increases, various portions of the network would be sequentially activated until full activation was achieved (indicated by progressively darker shading of pathway components). Full pathway activation triggers a robust response throughout the pathway circuitry, leading to adverse outcomes measurable in the cellular assay.</div></div>
