From: K-RAS GTPase- and B-RAF kinase-mediated T-cell tolerance defects in rheumatoid arthritis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The ERK signaling pathway controls T-cell activation and anergy. The diagram illustrates the activation of the ERK pathway after T-cell receptor activation. Increased cytoplasmic concentrations of K-RAS and B-RAF, as seen in T cells from patients with RA, increase the activation of the ERK pathway and alleviate the need for CD28-mediated co-stimulation. Increased ERK activity prevents the induction of anergy by preventing SHP-1 recruitment to the T-cell receptor signaling complex, sustains T-cell receptor signaling, and may contribute to the autoreactivity to citrullinated self-antigens characteristic of RA.</div></div>
