Microarray analysis reveals that WNT5A is strikingly upregulated, and WIF1 down-regulated in the vast majority of lesional skin samples.  From: Evidence for altered Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in psoriatic skin. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">This gene expression heat map image used transcripts from 58 paired lesional and uninvolved psoriasis and 64 normal skin samples and displays Wnt pathway members, regulators of Wnt signaling, and regulators of growth, proliferation and transcription. In addition genes involved in protein kinase activity, protein phosphatases, protein ubiquitination and other genes related to Wnt signaling are shown. Color key: red, increased expression, blue, decreased expression, as indicated in the color key and histogram (inset).</div></div>
