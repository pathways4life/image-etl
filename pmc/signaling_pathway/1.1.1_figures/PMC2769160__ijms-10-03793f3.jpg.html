Trehalose in prokaryotes dramatically accumulates in osmotic or thermal stress conditions; it can signal from the bacteria to the plant cell stress tolerance and nitrogen and carbon metabolism. In plants, trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) plays a central role regulating sugar metabolism and plant development. Glucose and trehalose are also important keys to several signaling and regulatory pathways and integrate external cues to adapt cells to abiotic stress, growth and development. It seems that TPS1 and ABI4 are part of the HXK1 signaling pathway. Other molecular actors in this network are the 14-3-3 proteins, which are known to interact with phosphoserine in diverse proteins including TPS; and SnRK1, which signals catabolism in starvation conditions, and is countered by T6P to induce anabolism. Thus, an important role of the trehalose biosynthesis pathway in higher plants would be the synthesis of small amounts of T6P and/or trehalose signaling molecules rather than accumulation of this latter as an osmoprotective compound.</div></div>
