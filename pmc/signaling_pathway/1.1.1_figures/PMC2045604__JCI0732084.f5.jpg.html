Activation of the HRI/eIF2αP <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> in BMDMs by LPS..  From: The function of heme-regulated eIF2? kinase in murine iron homeostasis and macrophage maturation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(<b>A</b>) Time course of the activation of HRI signaling pathway upon LPS treatment. Cells were harvested after LPS treatment at the time points indicated, and equal amounts of protein extracts were analyzed for expression of HRI, eIF2αP, Chop, and total eIF2α by Western blot analyses. (<b>B</b>) ROS production in macrophages upon LPS treatment. DCF fluorescence in macrophages was measured by FACS analysis after 6-hour LPS treatment with or without β-ME (n = 3). (<b>C</b>) Prevention of the activation of HRI signaling pathway by LPS with β-ME. After 6-hour LPS treatment in the presence or absence of β-ME, expression of eIF2αP, Chop, and total eIF2α proteins was analyzed. The ratios of eIF2αP to eIF2α and Chop to eIF2α were calculated. The ratio of each at time 0 was defined as 1. The normalized ratios are shown above the autoradiograms.                </div></div>
