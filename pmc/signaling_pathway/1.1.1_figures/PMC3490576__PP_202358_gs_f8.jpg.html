From: Strigolactones Are Involved in Root Response to Low Phosphate Conditions in Arabidopsis[W][OA]. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic illustration of the hormonal pathways activated by SLs in response to low Pi growth conditions. Under conditions of Pi depletion, and in response to endogenous P concentrations, the SL pathway, through MAX2, is suggested to activate TIR1 expression and the auxin signaling pathway, and thereby regulate root development to suit those growth conditions. Another possibility is that there could also be a parallel pathway to TIR1 that involves IAA, in a MAX2-independent pathway, which leads to partial low Pi response at early stages. However, evidence is found to the existence of other pathways that are MAX2 independent, which may dominate low Pi response during later stages of development.</div></div>
