The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 activates NGFI-B and further promotes the transcription of POMC. Our results have shown that MAP3K8 mediates the CRF signal pathway through regulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation and POMC expression. However, miR-375 functions as a negative regulator in this pathway by down-regulating MAP3K8 protein levels in AtT-20 cells. CRF also inhibits the expression of miR-375 through PKA. This pathway indicates that miR-375 is a downstream molecule of PKA, which targets MAP3K8, and subsequently down-regulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the expression of NGFI-B. This is a novel signaling pathway that mediates the effect of CRF, which regulates the expression of POMC, thus regulating the POMC-related hormone secretion in the pituitary gland. Arrows indicate stimulation; T bars indicate inhibition.</div></div>
