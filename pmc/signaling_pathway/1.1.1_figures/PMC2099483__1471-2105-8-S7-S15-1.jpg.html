This is a fragment of the KEGG pathway with superimposed plots of circadian expression profiles for the essential components of the pathway. Every gene involved in leptin signaling demonstrates explicit circadian pattern in baseline oscillation. All except one oscillate in the same phase. Leptin itself is actively expressed in brown adipose tissue and its intensity oscillates with a phase shift, slightly behind leptin receptor (LEPR) and other components of leptin signaling. Remarkably, suppressor of cytokine signal (SOCS3) has two alternative transcripts oscillating in counter-phase.</div></div>
