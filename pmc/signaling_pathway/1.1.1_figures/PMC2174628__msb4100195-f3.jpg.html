The boxed cascade (left) represents an invertebrate primordial signaling pathway comprising a growth factor, an RTK and a signaling cascade culminating in regulation of gene expression (horizontal arrows). Two RTK expansion scenarios are presented. According to Option A, two events of RTK duplication generate four vertical cascades that gradually diverge, but they remain isolated from each other. According Option B, the four cascades richly interact and ultimately establish a layered signaling network. The lines of evidence we describe herein propose that the evolution of RTKs in vertebrates preferred Option B, because it imparts robustness and guarantees output reproducibility.</div></div>
