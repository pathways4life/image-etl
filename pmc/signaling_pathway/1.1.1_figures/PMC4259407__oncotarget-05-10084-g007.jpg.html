Model depicting the role of HAX1 in the non-canonical NF-κB <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>.  From: HAX1 regulates E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of cIAPs by promoting their dimerization. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In the steady state, cIAPs lead to poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NIK via their RING domain together with TRAF2 and TRAF3. The degradation of NIK results in the suppression of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. Binding of HAX1 to the cIAPs results in the auto-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of cIAPs. Consequently, reduced cIAP levels leads to the stabilization of NIK, which induces activation of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway.</div></div>
