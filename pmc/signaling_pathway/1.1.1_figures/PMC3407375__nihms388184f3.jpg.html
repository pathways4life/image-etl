From: MicroRNA Circuits in Transforming Growth Factor-? actions and Diabetic Nephropathy. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Signaling loops initiated by TGF-β accelerate downstream action and effects via miRNAs. A) TGF-β increases miR-192 expression via Smad3 or p53. TGF-β1 gene expression is itself auto-upregulated by miR-192 through Zeb1/2. B) miR-192 enhances p53 levels via inhibition of Mdm2 (inhibitor of p53). p53 increases transcription of miR-192 through p53 responsive elements on the promoter. C) miR-200 family members can further augment their own expression through inhibition of Zeb1/2. Initial expression of miR-200 family can also be induced by miR-192 through Zeb1/2. D) The promoter of the non-coding RNA RP23 (the host gene of miR-216a and miR-217) also contains E-boxes 6 and increased miR-216a also activates its own promoter through Tsc-22 and Tfe3. miR-216a/Ybx1 pathway can amplify the signaling initiated by TGF-β and miR-192.</div></div>
