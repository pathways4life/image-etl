Scheme of signaling pathways between the ureteric buds (green) and the metanephric mesenchyme (yellow-orange). The most important inducer of UB outgrowth is the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase signaling pathway mediated by Gdnf and its receptor Ret. Ret is expressed by the nephric duct (green) and ureteric buds (green). Gdnf is secreted by the metanephric mesenchyme (yellow). The coordination of different signaling pathways in the anterior mesenchyme and the metanephric mesenchyme play a crucial role in the development of a single ureteric bud.</div></div>
