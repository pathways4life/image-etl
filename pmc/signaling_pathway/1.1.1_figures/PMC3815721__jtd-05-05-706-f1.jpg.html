Interaction of HMGB1 with RAGE activates the NF-κB and MAPK pathway, resulting in the up-regulation of HMGB1, RAGE and other proinflammatory mediators and promoting the development of ALI/ARDS. Activation of PPARγ induces HO-1 expression and subsequent suppression of HMGB1-RAGE signaling pathway. Therefore, we hypothesize that up-regulation of HO-1 by activation of PPARγ might inhibit HMGB1-RAGE signaling pathway and ameliorate the development of ALI/ARDS.</div></div>
