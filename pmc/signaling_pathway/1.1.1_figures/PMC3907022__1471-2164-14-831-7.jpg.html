(A)</b> Hierarchical clustering clustered three of the 5 months AD samples with the 4 months samples (now termed Stage 1), and the remaining four with the 6 months samples (now termed Stage 2). The 5 months AD samples are shown in red. <b>(B)</b> The 5 months samples in Stage 1 were compared with the 5 months samples in Stage 2 using Cuffdiff. A total of 187 genes were differentially expressed (47 upregulated, 187 downregulated, see Additional file 3). <b>(C)</b> Pathway analysis showed that both the ribosome (Rib.) and insulin signaling pathway (Ins. Sign.) were overrepresented in the DE genes (P &lt; 0.05). <b>(D)</b> Comparing Stage 1 with Stage 2, six genes in the insulin signaling pathway were differentially expressed (3 upregulated, 3 downregulated).</div></div>
