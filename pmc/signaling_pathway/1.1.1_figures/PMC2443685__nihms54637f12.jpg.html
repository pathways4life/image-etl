Schematic representation of a <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> for protection of cardiomyocytes by EET via the PI3K/Akt pro-survival <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>.  From: Multiple anti-apoptotic targets of the PI3K-Akt survival <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> are activated by epoxyeicosatrienoic acids to protect cardiomyocytes from hypoxia/anoxia. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">We have reported that pretreatment with EET increases (i) PI3K activity (ii) phosphorylation of Akt (iii) phosphorylation of BAD (iv) intracellular XIAP and (v) inhibition of activity of caspases-9. Each of these events decreases activity of caspase 3, a late effector, to protect the cardiomyocyte from apoptosis by HR. These targets are known to align in a signaling cascade as illustrated in the schematic. It should be noted that the results do not implicate absence of other pro-survival or mitotic pathways that may also be targeted by EETs.</div></div>
