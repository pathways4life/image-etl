When the TGF-β response is transmitted via ALK1, the proliferation and migration genes are stimulated giving rise to the activated phase of angiogenesis (activated endothelium). However, when the ALK5 pathway is predominant, the genes coding for extracellular matrix (ECM) components are upregulated and the proliferation and cell migration genes are repressed, leading to a quiescent endothelium. In addition, ALK1 and ALK5 functionally regulate each other. Adapted from Lebrin et al.44</div></div>
