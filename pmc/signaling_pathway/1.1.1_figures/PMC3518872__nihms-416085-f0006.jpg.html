As selected from Table 7, these pathways areα-Adrenergic Signaling (<b>A</b>), Endothelin-1 Signaling (<b>B</b>), and P2Y Signaling (<b>C</b>). Molecules are indicated by standard abbreviations. Relative changes in gene expression are depicted by gradated shades of color coding: red, up; green, down; white, no change. Direct and indirect interactions between molecules are depicted by solid and dotted lines, respectively.</div></div>
