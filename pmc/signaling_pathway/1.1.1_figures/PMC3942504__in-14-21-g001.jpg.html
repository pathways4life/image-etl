From: Insights into the Role of Follicular Helper T Cells in Autoimmunity. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Molecular mechanisms of Bcl-6 expression in T cells. Bcl-6, the master regulator of TFH cell differentiation is controlled by a complex signaling pathway. Co-stimulatory molecules such as CD28 and ICOS activate PI3K to induce Bcl-6 expression. PTEN, PHLPP2 inhibit Bcl-6 expression through interfering PI3K signaling and Foxo1 directly inhibits Bcl-6 expression. Various cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-21, IL-12, and IFN-Î³ induce Bcl-6 expression through JAK-STAT signaling pathway while high level of IL-2 in combination with IL-12 induces T-bet to inhibit Bcl-6. Blimp-1 and Bcl-6 is reciprocally regulating each other to make a decision of effector T cell fate between TFH and non-TFH effector cells. Some miRNA such as miR-17-92 induces Bcl-6 expression by interfering phosphatases, which inhibit PI3K signaling pathway while miR-10a directly inhibits Bcl-6 expression.</div></div>
