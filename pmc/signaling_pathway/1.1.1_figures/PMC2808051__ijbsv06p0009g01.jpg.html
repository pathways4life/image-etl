Binding of the ligand to the insulin like growth factor-I Receptor initiates the signaling cascade, which is propagated by PI3K. Akt acts as the signaling hub for the majority of the downstream effects such as cell cycle control, glycogen synthesis and apoptotic suppression. The phosphorylation state of Akt is critically regulated by protein phosphatases (PTEN/PP2) and protein kinases (PDK-1).</div></div>
