From: Roles of Heparan Sulfate Sulfation in Dentinogenesis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>A model of Wnt signaling regulation induced by cell surface HSPG desulfation during dentinogenesis.</b> Desulfation by Sulf reduces the affinity of cell surface HS for Wnt10a as a means of facilitating Wnt10a binding to its receptor and hence potentiating the Wnt canonical signaling pathway, which consequently up-regulates Dspp expression in odontoblasts.</div></div>
