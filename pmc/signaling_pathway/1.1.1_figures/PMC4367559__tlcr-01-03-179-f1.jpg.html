From: Role of HGF/MET axis in resistance of lung cancer to contemporary management. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic representation of MET/HGF signaling and functional cross-talk with other pathways. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) binds to MET receptor and activates kinase activity which then phosphorylates the docking site and recruits effector molecules [Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), GRB2-associated-binding protein 1 (GAB1), SRC homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2), Son of sevenless-1 (SOS-1) and Sarcoma non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC)]. Downstream signaling pathways such as the Mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway, the Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K-AKT) pathway and the Phospholipase-Cγ (PLC-γ) pathway are activated. These effector pathways are shared by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/EGF) pathway, the vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGFR-2/VEGF-A) pathway, the HER2 pathway and the EML4-ALK pathway. The signals affect gene expression and promote cell proliferation and survival, angiogenesis and cytoskeletal alterations resulting in cancer growth and progression. EGFR and HER2 can Trans-phosphorylate and activate MET. MET activation increases transcriptional expression of VEGF-A and WNT ligand and activates VEGF pathway and WNT-β-catenin pathway, respectively. β-catenin increases MET expression.</div></div>
