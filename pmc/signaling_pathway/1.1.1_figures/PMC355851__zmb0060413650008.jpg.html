From: Distinct Activities of the ?-Catenin Family, ?-Catulin and ?-Catenin, on ?-Catenin-Mediated <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for the observed inhibitory effects of α-catulin and α-catenin on the activation of cyclin D1 transcription. The cyclin D1 promoter is activated by serum via a Ras-mediated pathway which signals to the EtsB binding site and by a β-catenin-mediated signaling pathway (inducible by LiCl) which signals to the TCF-1 binding site. α-Catenin likely inhibits β-catenin-mediated activation through its direct interaction with β-catenin, as proposed by others (7). We propose that α-catulin may inhibit Ras-induced cyclin D1 promoter activation via attenuation of Rho-mediated signaling downstream of Ras.</div></div>
