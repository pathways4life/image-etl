Work described here and elsewhere suggests that Sck1 is both a negative regulator of cAMP signaling via Gpa2 regulation and a kinase that acts in parallel to PKA, possibly as a sensor of nitrogen levels. Gpa2 activation of PKA is via the activation of adenylyl cyclase (Git2/Cyr1; not shown).</div></div>
