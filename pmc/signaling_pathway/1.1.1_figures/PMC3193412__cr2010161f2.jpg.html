The non-canonical pathway is activated through developmental signals activating NIK/IKK1. This activation results in the degradation of IκBδ and processing of p100 and allows the nuclear translocation of RelA:p50, RelB:p50 and RelB:p52 dimers, which activate genes responsible for organ development. The canonical pathway is activated through pathogen and inflammatory signals activating NEMO/IKK. This activation results in the degradation of IκBα/IκBβ/IκBɛ, allowing for the nuclear translocation of RelA:p50, RelA:RelA and cRel:p50 dimers, which then activate genes responsible for inflammation and survival.</div></div>
