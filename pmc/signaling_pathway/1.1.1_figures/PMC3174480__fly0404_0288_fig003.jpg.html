From: Lgl/aPKC and Crb regulate the Salvador/Warts/Hippo                     <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Lgl/aPKC regulates Yki activity by promoting the formation of Hpo/RASSF                         complexes. Lgl/aPKC regulate the SWH pathway by favoring the formation of                         inactive Hpo/Rassf over active Hpo/Sav protein complexes. Hpo/Rassf are                         unable to phophorylate Yki. Consequently, pYki levels are reduced and                         dephosphorylated Yki enters the nucleus to form a complex with Scalloped                         (Sd) and activate SWH pathway targets. Perhaps the mislocalization and                         formation of Hpo/Rassf complexes is due to disruptions in endocytosis. (B).                         Crb regulates Yki activity by reducing the levels of Ex/Yki complexes. Crb                         regulates the SWH pathway through direct interactions with Ex. Crb/Ex/Yki                         form a tripartite complex and Yki is sequestered in the cytoplasm and                         prevented from entering the nucleus by binding to Expanded (Ex). The                         overexpression of Crb reduces Ex/Yki complexes, freeing Yki to enter the                         nucleus, interact with Scalloped (Sd) and activate SWH target genes. It is                         possible that Ex/Yki complexes are regulated by ubiquitination and/or                         proteolysis. crb mutant tissue also shows overgrowth due to                         deregulation of Notch endocytosis but the influence of Notch signaling on                         SWH pathway targets remains to be determined.</div></div>
