Activation of mTORC1 ultimately leads to increased protein synthesis, and thereby increased cell growth. Germline mutations that result in mTORC1 hyperactivation are therefore associated with syndromes characterized by cellular overgrowth, usually in the form of hamartomas. LKB1 also activates an mTORC1-independent pathway that controls neuronal polarity specification; it is therefore possible that the neuronal migration defects seen in individuals with PMSE may be due to effects on this pathway, and not to hyperactivation of mTOR signaling. This would explain the lack of neuronal migration defects in disorders associated with germline mutations that do not affect LKB1 localization or function. 4E-BP1, eIF4E-binding protein 1; eIF4E, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E; MAP, microtubule-associate protein; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinaseâ€“1; Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain; S6K1, S6 kinase, 70 kDa, polypeptide 1.</div></div>
