The mRNA expression of Smad3, COLl1A2, and COL3A1 was significantly decreased, while that of Smad7 dramatically increased, However, the mRNA expression of Smad2, Smad4, TβRI, TβRII remained unchanged after 18α-GA treatment. The mRNA expression of target genes was normalized to that of GAPDH and a value of 1.0 was assigned to the mRNA expression of target genes in the control group. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 vs control.</div></div>
