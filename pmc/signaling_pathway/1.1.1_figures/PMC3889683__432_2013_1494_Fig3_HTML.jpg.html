This signaling pathway is assumed based on the current literature, which, we believe, is activated by cellular adaptive response under anti-cancer chemo- and/or radio-therapy, and contributes to an adaptive resistance in cancer cells. Note that, the HER2-NF-κB-PI3 K-Akt-STAT3 pathway proposed here may be activated not only in the HER2-positive breast cancer but also activated in the HER2-negative cancer since HER2 transcription is shown to be induced by radiation and DNA-damaging anti-cancer modalities without HER2 gene copy enhancement</div></div>
