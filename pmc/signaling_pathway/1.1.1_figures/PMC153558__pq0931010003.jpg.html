From: Radar breaks the fog: Insights into dorsoventral patterning in zebrafish. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of the maternal Radar signaling pathway mediating early steps of dorsoventral axis formation. Radar acts through the TGF-Î² type I receptor Alk8 and causes transcriptional activation of BMP2b and BMP4. The intracellular signal transducer, believed to be a member of the Smad1/5/8 protein family is not known (indicated in gray), although Smad5 may be excluded. Maternal Smad5 may transduce the signal of a hypothesized distinct maternal signaling pathway acting in parallel to Radar. Alk8 is also the receptor for zygotic BMP2b/7 signaling, and Smad5 transduces that signal, leading to the autoregulatory transcriptional activation of BMP2b/4/7.</div></div>
