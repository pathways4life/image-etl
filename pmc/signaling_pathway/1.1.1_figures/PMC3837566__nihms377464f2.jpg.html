However, tumor cells acquire resistance to this therapy during the course of treatment. Several mechanisms that involve reactivation of ERK signaling through amplification or mutation of proteins in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway (i.e. NRAS, BRAF, CRAF and COT1) have been recently described for the development of acquired resistance. In addition, hyper-activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (i.e. through upregulation of IGF-1R or PDGFRÎ²) can also be involved in resistance by promoting survival or proliferation. BRAFV600E suppresses the LKB1 tumor suppressor and AMPK through the BRAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade, and this regulation is critical for melanoma cell proliferation.</div></div>
