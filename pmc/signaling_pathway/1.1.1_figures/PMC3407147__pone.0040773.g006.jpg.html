HEK 293 stable transfected cell line (TLR4-MD2-NF-kB-SEAP) was activated with LPS (TLR-4 ligand) and treated with varying concentrations of EM-163 (1 mM to 50 µM). Culture supernatants were tested for SEAP activity and compared to levels in the absence of EM-163. (<b>A</b>) Inhibition of SEAP reporter activity, (<b>B</b>) inhibition of TNF-α and IL-1β production, (<b>C</b>) Inhibition of TNF-α and IL-1β production by EM-163 after SEB stimulation of HEK 293 cells transfected with HLA-DR (α/β) and FLAG-MyD88. Results represent three experiments.</div></div>
