Diagram showing major proteins involved in formation of cadherin, α-, β-, γ-, and p120-catenin complexes at the plasma membranes of two juxtaposed cells. Although cadherins are implicated in regulation of receptor-type tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and protection from apoptosis, catenins have multiple overlapping and distinct functions. Both p120-catenin and α-catenin regulate NFκB and MAPK signaling pathways, cytokinesis, and cell proliferation. However, p120-catenin has a unique function in the control of RhoA signaling and microtubule cytoskeleton organization, whereas α-catenin is implicated in regulation of RTKs, Hedgehog signaling, microtubule-mediated traffic, and functional coupling between the junctions and the actin cytoskeleton. β-catenin is a principal player in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Because RTKs, Hedgehog, and Wnt signaling mechanisms are heavily implicated in regulation of normal development, intriguing connections between cadherin–catenin receptors and these pathways provides potential tools for integrating the efforts of individual cells into a smoothly orchestrated developmental process.</div></div>
