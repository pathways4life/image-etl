(<b>A</b>) Upon binding to a ligand, the transmembrane Notch receptor is cleaved by Î³-secretase, allowing the intracellular domain to translocate to the nucleus, where it can activate a variety of transcription programs, including that of its own ligand. Notch signaling can, therefore, play a role in synchronizing signaling across cells in a population. (<b>B</b>) Western blot readouts of proteins affected by honokiol and/or IR from Ponnurangam et al.5 are represented as discrete digital values of activate and inactive states. (<b>C</b>) The initial proposed interaction network describing the effect honokiol and IR on cellular signaling with cross talk to the Notch pathway. Black edges with arrows indicate activating regulations and red edges with blunt ends indicate inhibiting regulations.</div></div>
