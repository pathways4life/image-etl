From: The cullin7 E3 ubiquitin ligase: A novel player in growth control. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Role of IRS-1 in insulin and IGF-1 signaling. Upon ligand binding to the receptor, IRS-1 is recruited to the receptor and phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, which serve as docking sites for adaptor proteins of the PI3K/Akt pathway or Ras-Erk MAPK pathway. Akt signaling is restrained by a negative feedback loop via mTOR and its effector serine/threonine kinase S6K. Phosphorylation of multiple serine residues on IRS-1 by mTOR/S6K may create a phosphodegron required for CUL7 E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.</div></div>
