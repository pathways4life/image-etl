From: Live Attenuated Rev-Independent Nef?SIV Enhances Acquisition of Heterologous SIVsmE660 in Acutely Vaccinated Rhesus Macaques. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Network pathway analyses were performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Network tool. Node colors show the average gene expression levels of RMs vaccinated with Rev-Ind NefÂ¯SIV relative to the average before vaccination (red, relative increase in expression; green, relative decrease in expression). CCR5, CCL3 and other signaling molecules were upregulated and were directly and indirectly involved with other immune system pathways. The numbers underneath the nodes are 1) log2-fold change, and 2) FDR-adjusted P values.</div></div>
