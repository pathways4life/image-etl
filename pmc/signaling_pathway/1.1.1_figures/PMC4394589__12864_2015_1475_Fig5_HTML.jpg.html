For each gene, expression has been represented relative to 0 h across the course of AOM, from 3 h to 7d; with white representing no change, red: up-regulation and green: down-regulation. The degree of regulation is indicated by color intensity. Both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling genes are regulated with similar kinetics. An exception is the STAT inhibitor CAV1, which is down-regulated early in AOM.</div></div>
