From: Selective Inhibition of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Cells by the HIV Protease Inhibitor Nelfinavir. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Effect of nelfinavir (NFV) on human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) signaling pathway. <b>A</b>) Effect of increasing concentrations of NFV on HER2 signaling pathway and caspase cascades in HER2-positive and -negative breast cancer cells. Cells were treated with various concentrations of NFV for 24 hours, and each protein level was analyzed by immunoblots. <b>B</b>) A time-course experiment of the NFV effect on HER2 signaling pathway and caspase cascades in HER2-positive breast cancer, HCC1954 cells. <b>C</b>) Effect of proteasome inhibitors and caspase inhibitors on NFV effects on HER2 signaling pathway and caspase cascades in HCC1954 cells. For the cotreatment experiments, cells were pretreated with either caspase inhibitors or proteasome inhibitors for 30 minutes and then incubated with NFV for 24 hours. z-DEVD (30 µM z-DEVD-fmk, caspase-3 inhibitor), z-IETD (30 µM z-IETD-fmk, caspase-8 inhibitor), z-VAD (30 µM z-VAD-fmk, pan caspase inhibitor), MG132 (0.4 µM, proteasome inhibitor), and BTZ (20nM bortezomib, proteasome inhibitor) were used for this study. Act-cas-3 = active form of caspase 3; Act-cas-8 = active form of caspase 8; Act-cas-9 = active form of caspase 9; NS = nonspecific band; pERK1 and -2; phospho ERK1 and -2; pHER2 = phospho-HER2; Pro-cas-8 = proform of caspase 8; Pro-cas-9 = proform of caspase 9.</div></div>
