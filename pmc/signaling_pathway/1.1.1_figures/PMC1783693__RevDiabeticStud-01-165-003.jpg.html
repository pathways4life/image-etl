The effects of the JNK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> on insulin resistance and glucose tolerance.  From: Involvement of Oxidative Stress and the JNK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in Glucose Toxicity. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The JNK pathway in the liver is activated by factors such as oxidative stress, free fatty acids (FFAs), and TNF-Î±. The levels of these factors are elevated under obese diabetic conditions. Serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and leads to an increase in insulin resistance. Expression of wild type JNK in the liver of normal mice decreased insulin sensitivity. Suppression of the JNK pathway by the treatment with Ad-DN-JNK enhances insulin signaling which leads to a decrease in gluconeogenesis and amelioration of glucose tolerance.</div></div>
