From: Rice Pti1a Negatively Regulates RAR1-Dependent Defense Responses. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Working Models of the Interplay of Pti1a and RAR1 in Defense Signaling in Rice.PAMP-triggered basal resistance and R protein–mediated resistance mostly share common signaling pathways for induction of defense responses, including defense gene expression, accumulation of phytoalexin, and HR. We hypothesize that Os RAR1 positively regulates defense signal transduction required for both basal and R protein–mediated resistance through the unknown protein X. Os Pti1a negatively regulates the signaling pathway indirectly by repression of Os RAR1 <b>(A)</b> or by directly acting on the pathway upstream or downstream of X-Os RAR1 <b>(B)</b>.</div></div>
