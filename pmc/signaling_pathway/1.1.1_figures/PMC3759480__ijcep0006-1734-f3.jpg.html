The 875 expression-altered genes were applied to IPA. IPA results showed that Wnt/β-catenin signaling was one of the most significantly activated pathway in gemcitabine resistant NSCLC cell lines. P value is 0.002 and 15 genes in the 875 gene-set were involved in this signaling pathway.</div></div>
