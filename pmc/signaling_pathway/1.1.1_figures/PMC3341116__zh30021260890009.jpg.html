From: Tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 functions as a tumor suppressor. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Putative pathway by which TNFR1 functions as a tumor suppressor. A: intact TNFR1 signaling modulates Wnt signaling or otherwise maintains β-catenin inactivated in the cytosol. Normal levels of TNF bind to normal numbers of both receptors and maintain gut homeostasis. B: absent TNFR1 signaling, increased levels of TNF bind to increased numbers of TNFR2 and result in increased epithelial cell proliferation. As well, possibly because of unmitigated Wnt signaling, activated β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, driving proliferation and neoplastic transformation.</div></div>
