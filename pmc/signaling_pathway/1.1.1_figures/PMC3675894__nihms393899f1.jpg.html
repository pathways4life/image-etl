HH signaling is initiated upon binding of a HH protein to its receptor PTC, which de-represses SMO. In the canonical pathway, SMO activation leads to increased transcriptional activity of the GLI family of transcription factors. GLI-independent actions of PTC and SMO are collectively known as “non-canonical” signaling.</div></div>
