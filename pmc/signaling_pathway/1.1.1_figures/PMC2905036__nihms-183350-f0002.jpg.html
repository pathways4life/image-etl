In response to iron, bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) binds to the BMP co-receptor hemojuvelin (HJV) as part of the BMP6/HJV/BMPR complex on the hepatocyte membrane to activate the SMAD1/5/8 pathway. Activated SMAD complexes bind directly to BMP responsive elements (BMP-REs) on the hepcidin promoter to induce hepcidin transcription. Holotransferrin (TF-Fe) competes for HFE binding to transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), causing HFE displacement to form a complex with TFR2 and TF-Fe to induce hepcidin expression, possibly through an interaction with the BMP6-HJV-SMAD signaling pathway and/or alternative signaling pathways such as the ERK1/2 pathway. In the setting of iron deficiency, the serine protease TMPRSS6 inhibits hepcidin expression by cleaving membrane-bound HJV to form soluble HJV, thereby inhibiting downstream SMAD signaling by loss of membrane-bound HJV and sequestration of BMP6 ligand.
