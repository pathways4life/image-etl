The combination of Casodex and Velcade should cause dual inhibition of the androgen-AR-mediated survival pathway in prostate cancer cells since Casodex-mediated inhibition is via its binding to AR and preventing the activation of AR signaling while Velcadeâ€™s action involves activation of calpain that consequently cleaves AR protein. Such combinational strategy could significantly enhance AR signaling inhibition and ultimately prostate cancer cell death, which may provide a compelling strategy for the treatment of HRPC.</div></div>
