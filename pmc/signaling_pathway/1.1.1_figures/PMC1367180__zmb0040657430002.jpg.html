From: Tumorigenesis Suppressor Pdcd4 Down-Regulates Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase 1 Expression To Suppress Colon Carcinoma Cell Invasion. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Pdcd4 inhibits the JNK pathway but not the ERK activation pathway. (A) JNK signaling pathway. JNK can be activated through a signaling pathway from Rac/cdc42 or, alternatively, through a signaling pathway from MAP4K1. (B) Pdcd4 inhibits phosphorylation of JNK and MKK-4 but not ERK. Western blotting was performed on cell lysates from the indicated cells with phospho-JNK, phospho-MKK-4, and phospho-ERK antibodies. The corresponding blots were stripped and reprobed with Pdcd4, JNK, MKK-4, and actin antibodies.</div></div>
