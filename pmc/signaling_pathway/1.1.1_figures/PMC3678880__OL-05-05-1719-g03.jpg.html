(A) Transcriptional activity of two transcription factors (TCF and LEF). FOP was used as the negative control. (B–E) Real-time PCR analysis of downstream Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway target genes (AXIN2, C-MYC, CCND1 and BIRC5, respectively). (F) Western blot for key regulators of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The cells were treated with IWP-2 for 3 days. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 and ***P&lt;0.001.
