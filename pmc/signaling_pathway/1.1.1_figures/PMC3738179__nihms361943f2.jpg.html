The Role of Cilia in Hedgehog <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Activation in Cancer Cells.

If cilia are present, then inhibitors targeting Hh ligand, Smo, and Gli trafficking (grey boxes) will be effective. Inhibitors that target Gli activity downstream of cilia (white box) will also be effective in reducing the Hh pathway in this context. <b>B.</b> Cancer-associated overexpression of Gli1 (GliA) in the presence of cilia will result in low levels of Hh pathway activation. In this context, cilia make the repressor form of Gli (GliR) counterbalancing GliA to reduce over activation of the Hh pathway. Mutations in REN(KCTD11) can also result in increased GliA activity. As this activation is downstream of cilia only the downstream Gli targeting inhibitors (white box) are predicted to be effective. <b>C.</b> Cancer-associated overexpression of Hh ligands or mutations in genes such as Ptch or Smo, which lie upstream of cilia, will not activate the Hh pathway in the absence of cilia. <b>D.</b> Cancer-associated mutations downstream of cilia such as overexpression of Gli1 (GliA) or mutations in Ren(KCTD11) have been documented in cancers and will turn on the Hh pathway in the absence of cilia due to high GliA and low GliR. Therefore, only downstream Gli targeting inhibitors (white box) are predicted to be effective in this scenario.</div></div>
