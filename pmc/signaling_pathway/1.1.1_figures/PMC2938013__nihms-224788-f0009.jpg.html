Model for Dixdc1 function during cortical development.  From: Dixdc1 is a critical regulator of DISC1 and embryonic cortical development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model for Dixdc1 function during cortical development. Top, During early cortical development, Dixdc1 binds DISC1 and together they synergistically regulate neural progenitor proliferation via modulation of Wnt-GSK3β/β-catenin signaling. Bottom, During later embryonic development, Dixdc1 integrates DISC1 into a pathway independent of Wnt-GSK3β/β-catenin signaling. In this neuronal migration pathway, Cdk5 phosphorylates Dixdc1, which regulate the formation of the DISC1/Dixdc1/Ndel1 complex that is essential for neuronal migration.</div></div>
