IKK is composed of two catalytic kinase subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) and one regulatory scaffold subunit (IKKγ or NEMO); IKKβ is the main kinase of the canonical pathway. IKK phosphorylates and promotes degradation of IκB, resulting in the release of NF-κB dimers, which can then translocate to the cell nucleus and bind to specific sequences in the promoter or enhancer regions of a large number of target inflammatory and other genes related to cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Key canonical pathway NF-κB dimers include NF-κB1 (p50), RelA (p65), and c-Rel.</div></div>
