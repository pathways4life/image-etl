Akt inhibits FOXO through direct phosphorylation, and indirectly activates mTORC1, which in turn elevates protein synthesis. mTORC1 and its downstream effector, S6K, elicit negative feedback loops to inhibit Akt. When activated FOXO induces the expression of Sestrin 3, which activates AMPK to inhibit mTORC1. FOXO also induces Insulin/IGF1 receptors, IRS2, and Rictor expression to activate Akt (see text for details). <b>B.</b> The signaling pathway from Insulin/IGF1 receptor through IRS, PI3K, and Akt in flies. The mechanisms of FOXO inhibition and mTORC1 activation by Akt are conserved in flies and mammals. In flies, the mechanism of TORC1 inhibition by FOXO through Sestrin and AMPK is conserved. In addition, FOXO elevates the expression of 4E-BP downstream of TORC1, and induces the expression of Insuin/IGF1 receptor to activate Akt (see text for details). <b>C.</b> The signaling pathway from Insulin/IGF1 receptor through PI3K, and Akt in worms. The inhibition of FOXO by Akt is conserved in worms. However, the mechanism of TORC1 activation by Akt is not conserved. Akt can activate TORC1 through inhibition of FOXO because FOXO inhibits the expression of Raptor, which is required for TORC1 activity (see text for details).</div></div>
