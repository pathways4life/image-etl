Most of the interested genes enriched in canonical pathway. The highly-expressed genes identified from dataset are represented with red color, and the down-regulated genes are represented with green color. The key genes of wnt signaling pathway such as wnt and beta-catenin were identified and marked in the map.</div></div>
