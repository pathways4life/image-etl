From: Omentin-1 Stimulates Human Osteoblast Proliferation through PI3K/Akt Signal <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Omentin-1 regulated proliferation of hOB through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The hOBs were pretreated with vehicle, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μM), or Akt inhibitor HIMO (10 μM) for 3 h prior to treatment with omentin-1 (200 ng/mL) for 48 h. The cells were also transfected with control siRNA or Akt siRNA before treatment with omentin-1 (200 ng/mL) for 48 h. Cell proliferation was determined by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. Results are expressed as counts per minute. *P &lt; 0.05 versus control.</div></div>
