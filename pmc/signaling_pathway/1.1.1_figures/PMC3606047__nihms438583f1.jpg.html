From: Adenosine <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> During Acute and Chronic Disease States. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Cellular injury associated with hypoxia and inflammation promote the release of ATP that is subsequently dephosphorylated by membrane bound CD39 and CD73. Extracellular adenosine then stimulates cell surface adenosine receptors (ADORA1, ADORA2A, ADORA2B, ADORA3) to influence tissue responses to injury. In acute disease states, adenosine largely contributes to anti-inflammatory and tissue protective responses such as the promotion of vascular barrier function. This signaling pathway also promotes wound healing. These adenosine responses are largely regulated by ADORA2A and ADORA2B signaling pathways. In chronic disease states, adenosine signaling can promote cellular processes such as fibrosis that contribute to disease progression. Depicted is fibrosis in the liver, lung and heart; however, findings suggest excessive adenosine signaling also contributes to fibrosis in the skin, kidney and penis. These responses are regulated by ADORA2A and ADORA2B signaling pathways. In addition, ADORA2B signaling promotes sickling of erythrocytes that can contribute to the progression of tissue injury, and promotes insulin resistance that can impact the development of diabetes.</div></div>
