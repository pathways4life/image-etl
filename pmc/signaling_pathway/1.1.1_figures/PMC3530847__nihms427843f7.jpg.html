(A) Inhibition of downstream signaling components blocks Ras-mediated pathway activation. Osteoclasts were infected with the caRas adenovirus of vector control. Following infection, osteoclasts were serum starved and treated with M-CSF in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, the Raf inhibitor GW5074 or DMSO vehicle control. Western blotting for phospho-MEK1/2Ser217/221, total-MEK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2Thr202/Tyr204, total-ERK1/2, phospho-RafSer338, phospho-RafSer259, and tubulin was performed. (B) Inhibition of Raf does not block PI3K-mediated pathway activation. Osteoclasts were infected with the caPI3K, dnRaf, dnRas, caPI3K and dnRaf, caPI3K and dnRas or vector control adenoviruses. Following infection, osteoclasts were serum starved and treated with M-CSF as indicated. Levels of phospho-MEK1/2Ser217/221, total-MEK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2Thr202/Tyr204, total-ERK1/2, phospho-RafSer338, phospho-RafSer259, and tubulin were then assessed via western blotting.</div></div>
