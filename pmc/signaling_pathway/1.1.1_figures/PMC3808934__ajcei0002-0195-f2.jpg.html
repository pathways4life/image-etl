From: Collaboration of Toll-like and RIG-I-like receptors in human dendritic cells: tRIGgering antiviral innate immune responses. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The interplay of TLR and RLR signaling. TLRs expressed on the cell surface or localized on intracellular membranes recognize various sets of pathogenic structures among them viral genomes or replication intermediates and transduce signals through the NF-ÎºB/type I IFN pathways. The TLR3 and TLR4 mediated signaling pathways are independent of MyD88 and IRAKs (IRAK-1/2/4), whereas the other TLRs use the MyD88 pathway. TLR4 is capable of using both MyD88-dependent and independent signaling. TRAF3 and TRAF6 have a cardinal role in both the collaboration and the essential signaling processes of TLRs and RLRs.</div></div>
