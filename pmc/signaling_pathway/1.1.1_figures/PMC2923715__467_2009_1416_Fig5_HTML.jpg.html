The canonical pathway is mediated through the cystoplasmic protein disheveled (Dvl) and ultimately effected through Î²-catenin-mediated transcription. The non-canonical pathway is mediated through membrane-bound Dvl and ultimately controls planar cell polarity. Inversin, the NPHP2 gene product, in concert with the NPHP3 protein, appears to facilitate development by controlling the Wnt pathway signaling. RhoA Ras homolog gene family, member A</div></div>
