(A) Venn diagram analysis of middle-aged (grey line) and old-aged (black line) significantly-regulated KEGG pathways demonstrated 27 common KEGG terms between old and middle-aged tissues. The common (27) significantly populated pathways for middle-aged (grey bars) and old aged (black bars) animals were then rationally clustered into subgroups focused upon disease pathology (B), neurophysiological activity (C), and intermediary cellular signaling activity (D). For each significantly-populated KEGG pathway a ‘hybrid’ score was generated which represents the −log10 of the enrichment probability multiplied with the relative enrichment factor compared to the background proteomic expression.</div></div>
