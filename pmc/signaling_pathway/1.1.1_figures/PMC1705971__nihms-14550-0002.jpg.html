Wild-type cells (TN125) carrying either a control vector, pRS416 (circles), or the GAL1-RAS2ala22 plasmid, pPHY2128 (triangles), were grown to mid-log phase in YM-glucose medium and transferred to a YM medium that contained 5% galactose and 2% raffinose. The culture density was assessed by spectrophoto-metric measurement of the OD600 at the indicated times after the transfer to galactose-containing growth medium. B, inactivation of the Ras/PKA pathway resulted in an induction of autophagy activity. Autophagy levels were assessed with the alkaline phosphatase-based assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”</div></div>
