From: Synaptic activity prompts ?-secretase-mediated cleavage of EphA4 and dendritic spine formation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Schematic diagram of EphA4 signaling at dendritic spines.</b> (A) Effect of familial Alzheimer's disease–linked mutation of PS1 on the processing of EphA4. PS double knockout cells were cotransfected with EphA4 CTF-HA and the indicated PS1 mutants. The purified membrane fractions were incubated for 4 h. The generated ICD was purified by immunoprecipitation using the anti-HA antibody, followed by Western blotting. (B) Schematic diagram of EphA4 signaling at dendritic spines. (B, top) Ephrin-dependent retraction of dendritic spines. Activation of EphA4 by Ephrin retracts dendritic spines by activating the RhoA signaling pathway, by inhibiting the integrin signaling pathways, and, possibly, by inhibiting the Rac signaling pathway. (B, bottom) γ-secretase–dependent enhancement of the formation of dendritic spines. Activity-induced processing of EphA4 by γ-secretase enhances the formation of dendritic spines by activating the Rac signaling pathway. EICD, EphA4 ICD.</div></div>
