(<b>a</b>) zVAD-fmk (zVAD) and BocD-fmk (BocD), but not QVD-oph (QVD), activate the PKC-MAPKs-AP-1 signaling pathway. L929 cells were treated with zVAD (10 μM), QVD (20 μM), or BocD (10 μM) for 6 h, and cell lysate was subjected to immunoblotting. (<b>b</b>) QVD, when combining with TPA, induces cell death. L929 cells were treated with zVAD (10 μM), QVD (20 μM), or DEVD-cho (DEVD, 100 μM) with or without the presence of TPA (80 nM) for 24 h, and cell death was quantified as described in Figure 3b. (<b>c</b>) TPA induces cell death in caspase 8 knockdown cells. L929 cells with knockdown of caspase 8, were treated with TPA (80 nM) or zVAD (10 μM) for 24 h, cell death was determined as described in Figure 3b. (<b>d</b>) Illustration of the signaling pathways for zVAD-induced necroptosis. Both promotion of autocrine production of TNFα by the PKC–MAPKs–AP-1 signaling pathway and suppression of caspase activation to stabilize RIP1 are required for necroptosis induced by zVAD</div></div>
