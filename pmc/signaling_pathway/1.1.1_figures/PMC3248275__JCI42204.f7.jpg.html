Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway induces cyclin D1 expression and mammary epithelial proliferation. Cyclin D1 levels are regulated at the level of protein stability, through inhibition of Thr286 phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Activation of the Akt pathway also induces phosphorylation of c-Raf, which inhibits transduction via the MAPK pathway. In postpubertal glands, ERα expression is downregulated in response to elevated E2. In postpubertal Tg glands, the combination of IGF-1 and E2 further reduces ERα levels. Due to this downregulation, ERα/IRS-1 complexes do not form, and the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway is not activated. However, Shc activation is maintained, allowing signal transduction via the MAPK pathway, which does not result in increased cyclin D1 expression or epithelial proliferation.    </div></div>
