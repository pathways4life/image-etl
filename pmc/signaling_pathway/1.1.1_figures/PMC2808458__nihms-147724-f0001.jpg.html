MyD88 dependent and independent TLR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways.

In the MyD88 dependent pathway, activation of IRAK1 by IRAK4 leads to IRAK1 autophosphorylation which facilitates TRAF6 recruitment. TRAF6 then recruits MAP3Ks such as TAK1, MEKK2/3 and ASK1. TAK1 activation leads to the activation of IKK complex and the subsequent IkB degradation and NF-kB nucleus translocation. TAK1 also activates the p38-JNK signaling pathway. Tpl2, MEKK2/3 and ASK1 activate ERK1/2, p38-JNK and p38 respectively. In the MyD88-independent pathway TRIF activates TBK1 as well as IKKi which turns on the IRF-3 transcription factor. TRIF also activates NFkB signaling through RIP1. One of the most important consequences of TLR signaling is the transcriptional regulation of inflammatory genes as well as genes involved in cell proliferation and survival carried out by four groups of transcription factors.</div></div>
