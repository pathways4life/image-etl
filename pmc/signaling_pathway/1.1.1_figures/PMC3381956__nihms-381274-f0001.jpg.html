Aberrant signaling resulting in activation of growth stimulatory pathways or interference of growth inhibitory pathways has been implicated in lung cancer pathogenesis. Activation of RTKs through ligand binding leads to up-regulation of multiple signaling pathways including the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and the STAT. GF, growth factor.</div></div>
