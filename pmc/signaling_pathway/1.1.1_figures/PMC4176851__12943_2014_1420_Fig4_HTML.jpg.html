(A)</b> Effects of miR-196 or NME4 plasmid transfection on MAPK, TIMP1 and MMP protein expression in OECM1 cells. Protein expression was determined by western blot analysis, and the density of each band was quantified. <b>(B)</b> Effect of miR-196 or NME4 plasmid transfection on p-JNK and MMP9 expression in OECM1 cells.
