The image was captured using Leica fluorescent microscope and analyzed using image J software. VEGF and VEGFR-2 staining was more pronounced in the sitagliptin treated group compared to the control. The area showing VEGF and VEGFR-2 staining was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased in the sitagliptin group as represented by their respective bar graphs. n  =  4; Data represents mean ± SEM.</div></div>
