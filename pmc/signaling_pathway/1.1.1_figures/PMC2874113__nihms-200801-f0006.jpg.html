Following transfection, cells were treated with SRT or TFP at the indicated concentrations for another 8 h. Cell lyasates were analyzed for firefly and Renila luciferese activities using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System. The results were corrected for transfection efficiencies with Renilla luciferase and expressed as fold induction of ISG56 luciferase for RIG-I or IRF-3-5D transfected cells relative to those of vector transfected controls. The results were representative of two similar experiments.</div></div>
