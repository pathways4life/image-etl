(B) Proposed working model for the stimulation of estrogen receptor ligand-induced non-genomic signaling pathway via p-ERK1/2 activation in IBC cells. Estrogen receptor ligand rapidly activates p-ERK1/2 phosphorylation, leading to the activation of estrogen non-genomic signaling including cell migration and invasiveness in inflammatory breast cancer.</div></div>
