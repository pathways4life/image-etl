Pathways for NF-κB activation.  From: NF-kappaB, a mediator for lung carcinogenesis and a target for lung cancer prevention and therapy. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The canonical pathway is activated by cytokines such as TNF-α. When TNF-α binds to the its receptor 1 (TNFR1), a signaling complex is formed to recruit and activate IKK, which leads to phosphorylation on IκB. IκB is subsequently ubiquitinated and degradated in the proteasome, resulting in NF-κB complex (p65/p50) translocation to the nucleus and activates gene transcription. The noncanonical pathway is activated by cytokines such as CD40L and lymphotoxin β. This pathway involves NIK-mediated IKKα activation and cleavage of p100 to create p52. The NF-κB complex (p52/RelB) moves to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. The atypical pathway is activated by a variety of stimuli such as UV. In this parhway, IKK-independent mechanisms are involved in IκB phosphorylation. Representative antiapoptotic factors induced by NF-κB are shown.</div></div>
