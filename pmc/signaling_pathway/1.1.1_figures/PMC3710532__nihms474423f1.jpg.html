(A) Mutation rates of the major mitogenic pathways (the PI3K pathway, the MAPK pathway and the JAK/STAT pathway) in 151 HNSCC patient tumors determined by whole exome sequencing. Components of each pathway examined are displayed underneath each pie chart. (B) Bar graph detailing the number of mutations (dark bars) of each particular component of the PI3K pathway as well as the number of HNSCC tumors harboring these mutations (grey bars). (C) PI3K pathway-mutated HNSCC tumors have higher of non-synonymous mutations and (D) cancer gene mutations when compared to HNSCC tumors without any PI3K pathway mutations. Bar graph representing the average number of non-synonymous mutations per tumor (C) and the average number of cancer gene mutations (D) in 151 HNSCC tumors. Statistical significance was calculated by Fisherâ€™s Exact test, P&lt;0.0001 (N=151). (E) Graphical representation of the number of HNSCC tumors with mutation of multiple components of the PI3K, MAPK and the JAK/STAT pathways, respectively.</div></div>
