Primary cultured kidney interstitial fibroblasts are treated with rapamycin. (A) Activation of mTORC1 signaling in Rheb overexpression cells. (B) Semi-quantitative analysis of mTORC1 signaling pathway protein abundance in primary cultured fibroblasts. *P&lt;0.05 compared with controls; #P&lt;0.05 compared with TGFβ1-treated cells (n=3). (C) Elevation of FN and α-SMA protein expression level in Rheb overexpression fibroblasts. (D) Semi-quantitative analysis of FN and α-SMA protein expression in primary cultured fibroblasts. *P&lt;0.05 compared with controls; #P&lt;0.05 compared with TGFβ1-treated cells (n=3). (E) Representative immunofluorescence images showing FN and α-SMA expression in the primary cultured fibroblasts. Slides are counterstained with DAPI for nuclear visualization.
