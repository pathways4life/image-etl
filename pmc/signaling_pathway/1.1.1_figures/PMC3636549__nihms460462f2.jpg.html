Thus, nuclear translocation of Hh-regulated transcription factors is prevented, and the pathway is OFF. (B) <b>PATHWAY ON.</b> When the extracellular microenviroment becomes enriched with soluble HH ligands, they bind to the receptor PTC and this interaction SMO, which turns into its active form. Activation of Smo inhibits Hh transcription factor degradation, leading to an intracellular signaling cascade that ultimately drives the activation and nuclear translocation of Gli family zinc-finger transcription factors, which induce the expression of Hh target genes (e.g. Glis, Ptc, Smo and Hh interactive protein, Hhip).</div></div>
