From: Fractalkine Attenuates Excito-neurotoxicity via Microglial Clearance of Damaged Neurons and Antioxidant Enzyme Heme Oxygenase-1 Expression. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Model of the role of sFKN in microglial phagocytosis and neuroprotection.</b> sFKN, which is secreted from neurons that are damaged by glutamate, promotes microglial phagocytosis of neuronal debris through the release of MFG-E8. sFKN also induces the expression of the antioxidant enzyme HO-1 in microglia via Nrf2 recruitment and activation of the JNK MAPK signaling pathway. The neuroprotective effects of sFKN are also mediated in part by activation of ERK MAPK, although the downstream signaling pathway has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, sFKN may be an intrinsic neuroprotectant for damaged yet surviving neurons.</div></div>
