(A) Levels of phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR), total mTOR, Mcl-1 and truncated Bid (tBid) extracted from athymic nude mice xenografts bearing DU145 cells were determined by Western blot analysis. (B) Working model by which the treatment of Mithramycin A (Mith) induces apoptosis in human prostate cancer through the mTOR/Mcl-1/tBid signaling pathway.</div></div>
