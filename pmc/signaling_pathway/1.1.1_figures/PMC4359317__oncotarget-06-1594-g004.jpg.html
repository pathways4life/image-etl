Predicted gene targets in the GATA3 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> display correlation with hsa-miR-532 in the ER- group and not in the ER+ group.  From: MicroRNA regulation of molecular pathways as a generic mechanism and as a core disease phenotype. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Six genes in the Gata3 signaling pathway were found to have a possible binding site with hsa-miR-532. The graphs presented here show the correlation between miR-532 and the six genes in the two groups tested (ER- and ER+) in the TCGA dataset. As can be seen here, a significant correlation was found in the ER- patients while a no correlation was observed in the ER+ group.</div></div>
