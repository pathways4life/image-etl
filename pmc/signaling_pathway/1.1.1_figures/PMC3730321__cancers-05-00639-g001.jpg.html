Growth factors and insulin lead to the activation of Ras or Rheb GTPase, via their specific receptors. Downstream of activated Ras, a pleiotropy of downstream targets (i.e., PI3K, Raf. Ral Gef, Rassf1/5) are activated that, cooperatively, contribute to the overall cellular signaling outcome. Activated Rheb, however, stimulates the mTor pathway, leading to either pro- or antiapoptotic signaling, which critically depends on the cellular context. For details see text.</div></div>
