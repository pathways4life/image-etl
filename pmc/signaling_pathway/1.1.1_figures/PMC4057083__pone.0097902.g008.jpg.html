Schematic diagram of wound healing-related cellular pathways and their cross-talks among inflammation, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis..  From: On the Crucial Cerebellar Wound Healing-Related Pathways and Their Cross-Talks after Traumatic Brain Injury in Danio rerio. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Pathways shown in blocks were enriched in the sub-networks (Fig. 7). Their cross-talks were observed in the cerebellar wound healing PPI network of zebrafish (solid arrows indicate cross-talks involving proteins in groups A, N, and P; dashed arrows indicate cross-talks involving proteins not in these groups). To establish cell communication and defense mechanisms (inflammation and immune response) after brain injury, cell communication was related to neurotransmitter-related pathways (through AP2 and AN2), the axon guidance pathway (through NP4 indirectly), and itself (through AN1). Defense mechanisms were related to the cell cycle pathway (through AP1), neurotransmitter-related pathways (through AN2), the cell communication pathway (through NP2), and neurodegenerative diseases (through NP2). Cell cycle pathways also interacted with gene regulation pathways through NP3 indirectly. (B) The cross-talks are found among pathways of inflammation, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis in cerebellar wound healing process. Inflammation is mediated by chemokine signaling pathway. New neural and vascular cells generation is mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and axon guidance pathway. PI3K in chemokine signaling pathway also regulates the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and axon guidance pathway. PAK2 in axon guidance pathway also maintains the stability of vascular.</div></div>
