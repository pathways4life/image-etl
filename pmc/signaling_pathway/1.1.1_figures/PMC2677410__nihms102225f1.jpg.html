In the context of cancer, an aberrant surge in signaling output would evoke fail-safe mechanisms (e.g. cellular senescence, apoptosis or terminal differentiation) which would extinguish the pre-malignant stem cell clone. The cells can become a neoplasia only when they escape these mechanisms (right panel).</div></div>
