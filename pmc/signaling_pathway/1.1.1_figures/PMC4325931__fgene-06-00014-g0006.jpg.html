The rat p53 signaling pathway is overlaid with the average of the log base 2 ratio values from the replicate samples. Red denotes induction, green repression and yellow no change. Gray indicates that the gene was not mapped. The legend illustrates the segmentation of the genes according to the data from a given treatment.</div></div>
