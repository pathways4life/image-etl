(b) Detailed interpretation of the relationships between each protein from the subcluster. On the basis of the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 5.0, the 35 blue-green proteins on the circle participate in the TGF-β signaling pathway, and the 10 red proteins inside the circle are unrelated. The violet proteins outside the circle are common neighbors that do not belong to the subcluster in panel a. Red lines represent significant protein pairs, green lines represent direct protein–protein interactions, and yellow lines represent both.</div></div>
