The results from the present study suggest that HCV core protein increases Ser312 phosphorylation of IRS-1, which in turn decreases Tyr phosphorylation of IRS-1. This results in impairment of the PI-3K/AKT signaling pathway and decreases insulin-induced glucose uptake by human hepatocytes. An arrowhead pointing upward (↑) represents activation, an arrowhead pointing downward (↓) represents the repression of activities, and blunt arrowheads (⊣) represent blockade of signaling.</div></div>
