(A) Model of plant growth control through GA-dependent signaling. Upon GA binding to its soluble receptor (GID1), signaling pathway is activated; DELLA proteins are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The major players of this GA-signaling cascade are the GA receptors (GID1), the DELLA repressor proteins and the F-box protein part of the SCF E3 Ubiquitin ligase complex. DELLAs are nuclear transcriptional regulators, which interact with other transcription factors (i.e. GA-TF, GA-dependent transcription factor) to modulate expression of GA-responsive genes. (B) Working model of flg22-induced plant growth inhibition that involve GA signaling cascade components and CML9.</div></div>
