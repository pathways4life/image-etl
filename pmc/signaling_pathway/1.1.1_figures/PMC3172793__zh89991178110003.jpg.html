Green and red symbols represent significantly down-regulated or up-regulated genes, respectively, in CD161hi CD62L+ cells compared with their CD161lo counterparts. White, gray, and orange symbols are not differentially expressed between subsets. (B) Volcano plots showing differentially expressed transcriptional profiles of CD161hi CD62L+ (left) and CD161hi CD62L− (right) subsets compared with their CD161lo counterparts are shown from 6 healthy donors. Genes/probes are color-coded as indicated in the legend.</div></div>
