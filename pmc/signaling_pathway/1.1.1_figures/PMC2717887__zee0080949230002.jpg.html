A, Candidate genes identified by DNA microarray were analyzed with the Ingenuity software tool to construct an objective signaling network. Up-regulated genes in the PE-treated rats are shown in red; down-regulated genes are depicted in green. B and C, Analysis of the network demonstrates a link between clusterin and the TGF-Î² signaling pathway. Components of the network are listed in B with fold change compared with control. Regulatory network showing potential interactions between molecules is shown in C.</div></div>
