Total cell lysates were prepared from INS cells treated with vehicle, KWG, KRG and five different LPs prepared under different steaming conditions, as described in the Materials and Methods section. Fifty micrograms of protein per sample were immunoblotted with antibodies for each protein. Three samples were assayed in triplicate via Western blotting. The values are expressed as meansÂ±SD. *P&lt;0.05 is the significance level compared to the vehicle-treated group.</div></div>
