(B, C) BCG823 cells were treated with varying amounts of LD053 for 48 h, or 10 Î¼M of LD053 for different time, and subjected to Western blotting for phosphorylation levels of proteins involved in the c-Raf pathway. (D, E) BCG823 cells were treated as in (B, C), and tested for proteins involved in the Akt pathway. Relative protein levels were quantified by densitometry and indicated under each blot. Relative protein levels were quantified by densitometry and shown in the histograms.</div></div>
