From: Repression of Ribosome and tRNA Synthesis in Secretion-Defective Cells Is Signaled by a Novel Branch of the Cell Integrity <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of the secretory signaling pathway mediating transcriptional repression of ribosome and tRNA synthesis. Turgor pressure generated by ongoing protein synthesis and a reduction or blockage in the delivery of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane is proposed to activate the pathway. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rom2 and the Rho1 GTPase are possible upstream components of the secretory signaling pathway (between Wsc and Pkc1) based on studies of actin depolarization (5). The number of steps downstream of Pkc1 is unknown. Arrows indicate activation; bars indicate repression.</div></div>
