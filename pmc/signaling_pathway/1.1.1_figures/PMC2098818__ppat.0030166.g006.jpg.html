Arrows indicate the positions of α and β isoforms of GSK3. The white line indicates that intervening lanes have been spliced out.(C) Immunoblot analysis for cell cycle proteins regulating the Rb pathway, probing for activated pRb, and total levels of Cdk2 and the Cdk inhibitor p27. Actin was used as a loading control.</div></div>
