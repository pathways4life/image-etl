(A) Expression levels of RKIP protein and downstream components of the ERK/MAPK pathway in HCC cell lines. Cell lysates of FOCUS, Huh7, Hep3B and HepG2 cells containing 100 µg of total protein were immunoblotted for RKIP, MEK1, ERK and their phosphorylated forms; actin served as a loading control. (B) The bar charts represent the results of densitometric analysis and reveal the ratio of RKIP and actin, phospho-MEK1 and total MEK1, and phospho-ERK and total ERK. (C) Ectopic expression of RKIP blocked IGF-I-induced ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in FOCUS cells. Cells were transiently transfected with either RKIP or vector plasmid. After 24 hours serum starvation, cells were treated with 100 nM of IGF-I (+) for 15 minutes or untreated (−). Cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted for RKIP and downstream signaling components of the pathway (c-Raf, MEK1, ERK and phosphorylated form); actin served as a loading control. (D) The bar charts depict the results of densitometric analysis from (C), and shown as the ratio of RKIP and actin, phospho-c-Raf and total c-Raf, phospho-MEK1 and total MEK1, and phospho-ERK and total ERK. The results are presented as the mean ± SE of triplicate experiments. (E) Knock-down of RKIP expression with siRNA induced the activation of IGF-I-induced ERK/MAPK signaling in HepG2 cells. Cells were transfected with either control si-RNA (C-siRNA) or RKIP-siRNA using the DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent. Cells were treated with 100 nM of IGF-I (+) for 15 minutes or untreated (−) 24 hours after serum starvation followed by immunoblot for RKIP and downstream signaling components of the pathway (c-Raf, MEK1, ERK and phosphorylated form); actin served as a loading control. (F) The bar charts depict the results of densitometric analysis from (E), and are expressed as the ratio of RKIP and actin, phospho-c-Raf and total c-Raf, phospho-MEK1 and total MEK1, and phospho-ERK and total ERK.</div></div>
