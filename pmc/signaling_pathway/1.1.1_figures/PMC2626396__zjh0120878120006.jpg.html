This diagram explains the influence of Ras signaling via its downstream effector pathways on permissiveness of MPNST cells to G207. In cells with low levels of Ras signaling, viral protein synthesis does not occur at an efficient level. However, exposure to virus does induce certain levels of apoptosis in these cells in part because of an inactive PI3K pathway failing to exert its anti-apoptotic effects. In cells with elevated levels of Ras signaling, however, efficient viral protein synthesis and activation of the PI3K pathway reduces the capability of cells to undergo apoptosis. The expected outcome of this scenario would be robust G207 replication and death of cells via lytic infection (necrosis).</div></div>
