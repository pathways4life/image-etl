Regulates Growth and Differentiation in Drosophila. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Panel (A) shows Sl, activated by the insulin pathway, acting as a liaison regulating MAPK pathway ligand processing, to foster MAPK activation to a level promoting growth (red inhibitory interaction). (B) Conversely, for differentiation, reduced insulin receptor signaling leads to lower levels of Sl activation and augmented Spi processing (different from A, gray inhibitory interaction; possibly other targets from those in A), and this, in turn, allows MAPK activation in a manner consistent with promotion of differentiation.</div></div>
