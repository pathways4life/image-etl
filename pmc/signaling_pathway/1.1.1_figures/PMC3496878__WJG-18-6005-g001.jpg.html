Some of the genes known to be functionally altered are highlighted in red. These signaling pathways, including growth factor pathway, Wnt pathway, Hedgehog pathway, Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and Jak/Stat pathway, can be a molecular targets for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
