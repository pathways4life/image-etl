A: Schematic of one arm of the IR signaling pathway including some components of the IR signaling complex (highlighted) and MAPK pathway components. B: Schematic of the egr-1 locus. C: Cells were treated as in Fig. 1A, cross-linked, and used in ChIP with antibodies to the β subunit of IR (IR-β), IR-β phosphorylated at Y1146 (pIR), Grb2, and SOS. ChIPed DNA was used in PCR as in Fig. 1C. Data represent mean ± SEM for three independent experiments.</div></div>
