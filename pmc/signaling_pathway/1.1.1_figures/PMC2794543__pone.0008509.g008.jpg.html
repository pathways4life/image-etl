Insulin-induced Srebp-1c transcription is mediated by the MAPK pathway in muscle cells. BIO inhibits the MAPK pathway, which could explain the down-regulation of Srebp-1c gene expression (<b>c</b>). In parallel, inactivation of GSK-3βY216 is followed by autophosphorylation of PDK1S241 which phosphorylates Akt1T308 (but not Akt2S473), then the subsequent phosphorylation of AS160S588 induces GLUT4 translocation (<b>e</b>). In contrast, insulin stimulates GLUT4 translocation through the PI3K/Akt2S473/AS160 pathway (<b>d</b>). BIO activates the AMP kinase pathway by phosphorylating AMPK-α1S485, which also induces GLUT4 translocation (<b>e</b>). These results strongly suggest that Wnt signaling, in contrast to insulin signaling, increases glucose transport in both insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant myotubes through the activation of AMPK-α1 and Akt2/AS160 pathways.</div></div>
