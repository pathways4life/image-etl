A) Common upstream components regulate of PLCε by Gs coupled receptors in adult cardiac myocytes and isolated pancreatic β cells [19,54]. B) Signaling downstream of PLCε. In red are components found to be involved in regulation of CICR in both cardiac myocytes and pancreatic β cells [19,54]. An alternative pathway has also been proposed and is depicted in black and may operate in β cells as well [57].</div></div>
