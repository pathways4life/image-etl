From: MEK5/ERK5 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>: The first fifteen years. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed MEK5 regulation in breast cancer: Similarly to MEK5/ERK5 pathway activation in physiologically healthy tissue, activation may occur through extracellular stressors, mitogens or cytokine activation to promote survival, anti-apoptotic signaling and proliferation of cancer cells. Some of the microarray analysis of breast cancer tissue samples as well as experiments completed by our laboratory suggests that activation of this pathway may lead to epithelial mesenchymal transitions (EMT), metastasis and invasion especially in more aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer.</div></div>
