We also found that mTORC2 is the dominant form in both ES and DSRCT, whereas mTORC1 is activated in WT. Our results also suggest a mechanism that may be used to predict response to IGF1R/mTOR inhibitor therapy, which is to compare Akt/mTOR pathway and Ras/Raf/ERK pathway activation. If the IGF1R/mTOR pathway is the dominant pathway, the patient may respond to IGF1R-related therapy.</div></div>
