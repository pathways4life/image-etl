The samples (column) were clustered into two groups, three replicates in the stage of L4 (L4-1, L4-2 and L4-3) were clustered together and three replicates at day 6 (D6-1, D6-2 and D6-3) were clustered together. There were 64 involved genes in MAPK signaling pathway from L4 to D6, which were clustered into 6 groups (the group from A to F).(<b>B</b>) It showed the heat map and hierarchical clustering in MAPK signaling pathway from the stage of D6 to D15. The samples were clustered into two groups, three replicates at day 6 (D6-1, D6-2 and D6-3) were clustered together and three replicates at day 15 (D15-1, D15-2 and D15-3) were clustered together. There were also 64 involved genes in MAPK signaling pathway from D6 to D15, which were clustered into 4 groups (the group from A to D). Red is for up-regulated and green is for down-regulated.</div></div>
