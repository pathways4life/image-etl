Canonical TGFβ signaling pathway involves activation of Smad2 and Smad3 proteins (Smad pathway). There are numbers of TGFβ signaling pathways that do not involve direct activation of Smads (non-Smad pathway). These non-Smad pathways include MAPK, Rho-like GTPase and PI3K/Akt, as examples. Activation of Smad and non-Smad signaling cascade ultimately leads to the transcription activation of target genes. Recently, our study uncovered that eEF1A1 is phosphorylated by type I TGFβ receptor kinase, which leads to the direct regulation of protein synthesis, without involvement of transcriptional regulation.</div></div>
