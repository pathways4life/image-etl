From: Regulation of TLR2-mediated tolerance and cross-tolerance through IRAK4 modulation by miR-132/-212. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PGN-induced miR-132 and miR-212 in TLR signaling. (A–B) A schematic summary of PGN-mediated induction of miR-132 and miR-212 targeting IRAK4 in tolerized and untolerized THP-1 monocytes. (C) LPS, PGN, and flagellin from bacterial infection bind to their respective TLRs and activate the MyD88-dependent pathway. This eventually leads to gene transcription with the production of TNF-α and other cytokines. The MyD88 pathway leads to activation of NF-kB and production of miR-146a whereas activation of CREB leads to miR-132/-212 production. miR-132/-212 targets IRAK4 whereas miR-146a targets IRAK2/1 and TRAF6. IRAK4 and IRAK2/1 are critical components of the myddosome which is in turn critical for activation of the MyD88-dependent pathway.</div></div>
