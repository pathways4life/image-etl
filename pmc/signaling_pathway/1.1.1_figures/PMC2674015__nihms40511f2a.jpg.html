A. Intracellular signaling events downstream of initial TLR4 activation. Both the MyD88 dependent and MyD88 independent pathways are active. B. Signaling events upon subsequent TLR4 activation. Signaling through the MyD88 dependent pathway is inhibited and signaling through the MyD88 independent pathway is enhanced.</div></div>
