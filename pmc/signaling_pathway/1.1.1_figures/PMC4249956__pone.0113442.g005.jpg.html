The phosphorylated EGFR of frozen section of A431 tumor tissue was analyzed by immunohistochemistry staining using p-EGFR (Tyr 845) antibody. Scale bar = 200 µm (B) EFGR downstream signaling pathway in tumor lysate was analyzed by western blot using each antibody as indicated. β-actin was used as a loading control.</div></div>
