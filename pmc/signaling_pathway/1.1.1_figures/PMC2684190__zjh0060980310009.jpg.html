A diagram of interactions that occur between the signaling fragments of HA generated by the HYAL2 of platelets and their involvement in the earliest stages of wound healing and the subsequent inflammatory phase. Aberrations in this pathway can lead to chronicity of inflammation and possibly to autoimmune disorders.</div></div>
