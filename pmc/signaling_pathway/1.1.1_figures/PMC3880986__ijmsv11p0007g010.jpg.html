Soluble CCL-5 induces the activation of Src, Cas and paxillin, then contributing to the changes in organization of cellular actin cytoskeleton, which thus promotes cell mobility events in human AGS gastric cancer cells. Treatment of 17β-estradiol significantly inhibits HBMMSCs-induced cell mobility by suppressing activation of CCL5-Src/Cas/paxillin signaling pathway.</div></div>
