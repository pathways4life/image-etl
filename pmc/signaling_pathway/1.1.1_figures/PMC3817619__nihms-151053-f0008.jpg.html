Extrinsic and Intrinsic Apoptotic Pathways.  From: Infarction Induced Myocardial Apoptosis and ARC Activation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The extrinsic pathway is blocked by ARC’s ability to bind heterotrophically to Fas and FADD and prevent assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Subsequently, activation of caspase-8 is inhibited and apoptosis is prevented. ARC blocks the intrinsic pathway with its ability to bind to BAX and block BAX’s conformational activation and translocation to the mitochondria.</div></div>
