Red coloring of readouts and bold lines indicate increased pathway activity. White coloring and non-bold lines indicate decreased pathway activity. Dotted line from FLT3L to p-Stat5 in FLT3-WT samples indicates connectivity in a subset of patients. Red “X” indicates DNA Damage. Faded modulators (FLT3L, IL-27) in FLT3-ITD indicate decreased modulator induced signaling.</div></div>
