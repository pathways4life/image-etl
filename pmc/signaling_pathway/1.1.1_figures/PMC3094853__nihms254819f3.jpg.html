The BT-474 cells, which are confluent in 6-well plates (3 mL), were treated for 3 h with different trifluoromethylcinnamic acids (50 µm), trifluoromethylcinnamoyl-SNAc esters (50 µm), and their CHS reaction extracts (10 µL). Whole-cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and probed with anti-phospho-HER2 (Tyr1221/1222), anti-HER2, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-Akt antibody, anti-phospho-PI3K (Tyr508), and anti-actin, respectively.</div></div>
