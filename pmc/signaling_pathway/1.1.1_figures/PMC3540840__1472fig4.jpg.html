Cellular protein was harvested and proteins [total (T) or phosphorylated (P) protein] were analyzed by Western blotting using commercially available antibodies. (B) Inhibition of inflammatory signaling pathways using specific inhibitors. BMMs were pretreated with inhibitors as indicated for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were then treated with LPS (20 ng/ml) for 1 h at 37°C. (C) Pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. Macrophages were pretreated with pathway inhibitors for 1 h at 37°C followed by LPS treatment (20 ng/ml) for 1 h. Medium was collected for cytokine determination by ELISA. Values shown are the mean ± SD of triplicate determinations. *P &lt; 0.05. aSignificantly different from SR-BI+/+ LPS, P &lt; 0.05. bSignificantly different from SR-BI−/− LPS, P &lt; 0.01.</div></div>
