Calcium signaling pathway <b>(a)</b>. Upregulation of calcineurin (CaN), calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMK), and protein kinase c (PKC) is shown. There are downstream contributions to multiple functions such as apoptosis, MAPK signaling, and phosphatidylinositol signaling. The same components are also affected in the long-term potentiation pathways <b>(b)</b>.</div></div>
