In the normal virgin mammary gland, PR induces a non-uniform PR expression pattern and competence to respond to β-catenin in alveolar progenitors (blue) during ductal maturation. During early pregnancy, PR-Wnt4 signaling induces expansion of ductal progenitors (yellow) to form side-branches through βcatenin-independent routes. PR and PRL (prolactin) cooperate to induce alveologenesis, a process that is β-catenin-dependent. Later in pregnancy, PR restrains and PRL promote alveolar differentiation. β-catenin is required for alveologenesis and may participate at multiple steps in the secretory differentiation pathway.</div></div>
