From: Activation of Notch-Mediated Protective <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in the Myocardium. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic representation of pathway interactions among HGF/c-Met, PI3K/Akt, and Notch signaling pathways. Activation of Notch receptor (red) by Delta/Jagged ligands (green) results in translocation of NICD (red oval) to the nucleus (purple), where Hes1 repressor (black) is upregulated, leading to downregulation of PTEN and c-Met transcription.25,31 NICD also induces proliferative signaling (green box). Activation of c-Met receptor (brown) by ligand HGF (yellow oval) stimulates PI3K (pink) and pAkt (blue) signaling. Phospho-Akt may interact with NICD in the nucleus, potentially increasing expression of Delta/Jagged ligands.25</div></div>
