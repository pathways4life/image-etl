The JAK/STAT pathway is a tempting target for novel therapeutics because it is relatively simple mechanistically, providing a direct translation of extracellular signals into a transcriptional response. Of the pathways identified, perhaps the most viable as a biomarker are the STATs. Among the small molecule inhibitors of this pathway are Leflunomide (a JAK inhibitor) and Atiprimod (a STAT3 inhibitor). </div></div>
