(<b>A</b>) Iap2 and TAB are located downstream of Imd. Overexpression of Relish constructs or Imd caused an activation of Att response in S2 cells. Att induction caused by expression of either Rel ΔS29–S45 or wild-type Relish could be blocked by RNAi targeting Rel but not RNAi targeting either imd, TAB or Iap2, indicating that both TAB and Iap2 are located upstream of Relish. Att induction caused by overexpression of Imd was blocked by RNAi targeting either Rel, imd, TAB or Iap2, indicating that both TAB and Iap2 are downstream of Imd. (<b>B</b>) Iap2 lies below TAK1 in the Imd signaling cascade. Overexpression of Iap2 caused a minimal but reproducible induction of Att expression, which was blocked by dsRNAs targeting the known components of the Imd pathway except dsRNA targeting either imd or TAK1. This indicates that Iap2 lies downstream of TAK1 in the Imd signaling pathway. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 and ***P&lt;0.001, when the Att expression levels are compared to GFP RNAi controls. Data are shown as mean±s.d. of three to six independent dsRNA treatments.</div></div>
