Green arrow indicates activation of PI3K signaling; red arrow indicates inhibition of PI3K signaling. The strength of PI3K signaling is influenced by opposing activation and inhibitory signals that are integrated from extracellular stimuli such as co-stimulation, co-inhibition, and cytokines/adipokines. Ultimately, the outcome of this “tug-of-war” determines whether a T cell becomes a Treg to mediate tolerance, or inflammatory Th subsets to mediate immunity.</div></div>
