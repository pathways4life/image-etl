The binding of RTK, including EGFR and PDGFR, by the p85 subunit of PI3K results in activation of the catalytic subunit (p110), which then catalyzes phosphorylation of PI 3,4-bisphosphate (PiP2) into 3,4,5-triphosphate (PiP3). Inversely, PTEN turns PiP3 into PiP2. PiP3 in turn activates phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), which phosphorylates Thr308 of Akt, while Ser473 of Akt is phosphorylated by mTORC2. Activated Akt then inactivates TSC1/TSC2 suppressor complex, which in turn activates mTORC1 as a result. The signaling pathway affects multiple cellular processes including cell survival, proliferation, and motility. Solid and dashed arrows indicate activation and suppression, respectively.</div></div>
