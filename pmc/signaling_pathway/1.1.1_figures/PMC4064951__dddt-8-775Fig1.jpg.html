From: Vemurafenib: an evidence-based review of its clinical utility in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Activation of the MAPK pathway through a BRAFV600E mutation.<b>Notes:</b> (<b>A</b>) Normal signaling of the BRAF pathway. The BRAF pathway initiates signaling through extracellular growth factor domains. RAS family members are subsequently activated through receptor tyrosine kinases domains, and activation of RAS proteins bind RAF isoforms leading to activation of RAF, followed by MEK, and the final step of phosphorylation of ERK. The net effect leads toward increased cell survival and decreased apoptosis. (<b>B</b>) BRAF mutant pathway. In the presence of an activating BRAFV600E mutation, BRAF no longer requires dimerization with RAS, and therefore remains constitutively active. (<b>C</b>) Inhibition of BRAF mutant pathway. The addition of vemurafenib inhibits mutant BRAF, thereby stopping downstream activation of the MAPK pathway, and thereby decreasing cellular proliferation and inducing apoptosis.<b>Abbreviations:</b> ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RAF, rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma; RAS, rat sarcoma virus monologue; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinases.</div></div>
