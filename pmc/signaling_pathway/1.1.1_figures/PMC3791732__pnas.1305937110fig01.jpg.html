The normalized transcriptional level of each of the known canonical RARA target genes is represented by its row-standardized Z score according to the red-blue color scale below. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the samples shows that the expression patterns of RARα pathway genes distinguishes CD34+CD38− cells (purple sample labels) from CD34+CD38+ cells (orange sample labels). Genes are ordered according to the unsupervised hierarchical clustering of their expression patterns across samples. The colored boxes above each column indicate whether that gene is canonically predicted to be activated by RARα (yellow boxes), inhibited by RARα (green boxes), or unknown (gray boxes). Arrows indicate genes known to be part of RA signaling machinery (ALDH1A1 and RARα), whereas arrowheads indicate classical targets of RA signaling pathway (RARβ, CARBP, CD38).</div></div>
