Activated PLCγ1 generates IP3 and DAG, leading to the activation of the Ca++-calcineurin-NFAT pathway, the RasGPR1-Ras-Erk1/2-AP1 pathway, the PKCθ-Carma1/Bcl10-NFκB pathway, and PKD. NFAT alone can induce T cell anergy by increasing expression of anergy promoting molecules including DGKα. This pathway, in concert with DAG-mediated pathways, leads to T cell activation. CD28 strengthens TCR signaling to promote PI3K activation and downregulates DGKα and ζ expression. DGKs convert DAG to PA and may inhibit DAG-mediated signaling.</div></div>
