PBT-1–induced genes are colored red, and the red numbers close to the genes indicate the fold increase. PBT-1–suppressed genes are colored green. (A) Cell cycle pathway. (B) Apoptosis pathway. The hypothetical PBT-1–regulated signaling pathways were modified from the KEGG and BIOCARTA databases.</div></div>
