From: Hepatitis C Virus Core Protein Inhibits Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha-Mediated Apoptosis by a Protective Effect Involving Cellular FLICE Inhibitory Protein. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A schematic diagram depicting the signaling pathway for TNF-α-mediated apoptotic cell death and the inhibitory role of HCV core protein. TNFR1 associates with TRADD, which recruits FADD for activation of caspase-8, and initiates the apoptotic signaling pathway. HCV core protein appears to inhibit TNF-α-mediated apoptosis by sustained c-FLIP expression, thus impairing activation of caspase-8 for downstream signaling of executioner caspases.</div></div>
