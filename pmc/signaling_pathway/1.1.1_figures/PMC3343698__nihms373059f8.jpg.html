Perspective: the NF-κB <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> system within the context of upstream, downstream, and coordinated regulatory networks.  From: Lessons from mathematically modeling the NF-?B <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The NF-κB signaling system receives inputs from signaling modules associated with a variety of receptors that respond to the presence of distinct classes of molecules. These same signaling modules also activate a subset of other signaling systems. The coordinated activities of the effectors of theses signaling systems together determine the cellular response via gene regulatory networks. Understanding how the coordinated activation of multiple signaling systems produce stimulus-appropriate cellular responses remains an important future goal.</div></div>
