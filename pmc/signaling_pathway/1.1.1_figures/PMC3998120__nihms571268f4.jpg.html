Amplification and Expansion of Oncogenic Pathways as Metastatic Traits.  From: Origins of Metastatic Traits. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Metastatic traits acquired by a quantitative gain in pathway output. Amplification of the signaling capacity of cell survival and proliferation pathways provides survival and stemness advantages to disseminated cancer cells. In this case, the level of metastatic fitness is proportional to the robustness of the signaling pathway. In primary tumors with a relatively high abundance of growth and survival signals, the signaling capacity of oncogenic pathways such as PI3K, Notch, and Wnt, is sufficient to support tumor growth. However, for disseminated cancer cells reaching distant tissue microenvironment where pathway-activating signals are scarce, the signaling capacity of these pathways is not sufficient for survival. The traits selected under such pressure include the expression of components that amplify the signaling capacity of the pathway in response to limiting levels of pathway activators in the host microenvironment. In triple-negative breast cancer examples include VCAM-1 and SRC as amplifiers of the PI3K pathway in cancer cells reaching the lungs or the bone marrow, respectively, whereas Tenascin C and Periostin act as amplifiers of the WNT and NOTCH pathways in cancer cells reaching the lungs.(B) Metastatic traits acquired by a qualitative expansion of pathway output. Tumor-initiating pathways may additionally provide prometastatic traits by gaining access to subsets of target genes that enhance the homing of disseminated cancer cells to sites of survival. In this case, the level of meta-static fitness is not linearly proportional to the signaling strength of the pathway but depends of the pathway activating an additional set of effectors. One example is provided by the expansion of target genes that the HIF pathway activates in renal cell carcinoma as a result of epigenetic modifications that open the gene promoters to access by activated HIF.</div></div>
