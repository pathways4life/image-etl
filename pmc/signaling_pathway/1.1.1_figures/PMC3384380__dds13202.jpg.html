Canonical pathways analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Foxp1 target genes were significantly associated with the NF-κB signaling pathway (Fisher's exact test; P = 1.9E−16). Green indicates downregulated genes and red indicates upregulated genes in response to FOXP1 overexpression in the striatum. Dark green indicates a greater magnitude of expression change compared to light green. With permission from Ingenuity Systems Inc. © 2000–2012. All rights reserved.</div></div>
