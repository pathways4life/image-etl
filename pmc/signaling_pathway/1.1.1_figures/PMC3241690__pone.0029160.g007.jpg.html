A proposed model of the function of NFI-C and TGF-β1 during odontoblast differentiation and homeostasis..  From: Crosstalk between Nuclear Factor I-C and Transforming Growth Factor-?1 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Regulates Odontoblast Differentiation and Homeostasis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">During early odontoblast differentiation, p-Smad2/3 induced by TGF-β1 signaling increased binding to NFI-C in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, MAPK activation by TGF-β1 signaling increased the interaction of phosphorylated NFI-C and Smurf1/2. Collectively, TGF-β1 and MAPK activation enhanced the interaction and formation of Smad2/3-NFI-C-Smurf1/2 complex and resulted in the degradation of NFI-C. In contrast, during late odontoblast differentiation and mineralization, NFI-C signaling resulted in the dephosphorylation of p-Smad2/3. Consequently, TGF-β1 induces odontoblast differentiation through the Smad signaling pathway in early odontoblast differentiation, while NFI-C signaling modulates late odontoblast differentiation and mineralization.</div></div>
