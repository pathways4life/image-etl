From: A computational screen for mouse <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways targeted by microRNA clusters. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of the regulation of the insulin signaling pathway by miRNA cluster mmu–mir-183–96–182. Mir-96 and mir-183 are mainly responsible for regulating Irs1, which is the key mediator of the metabolic aspect of the insulin pathway, whereas mir-182 targets Rasa1 and Grb2, both of which play important roles in linking insulin signaling with the Ras pathway. A dotted arrow indicates the experimentally verified miRNA and target gene interactions via luciferase activity assay.</div></div>
