Direct genomic signaling pathway, considered the classical mechanism of estrogen signaling, promotes target gene expression by binding the E2-ER complex directly to the ERE. (II.) In the case of indirect genomic signaling pathway, E2-activated ERs bind DNA through protein-protein interactions with other classes of transcription factors at their respective response elements. (III.) Non-genomic signaling pathway starts with the binding of E2 to the ERs located at the plasma membrane resulting in the activation of various protein-kinase cascades. These can eventually lead to changes in gene expression due to phosphorylation of transcription factors. (IV). Ligand-independent signaling pathway causes ER activation and target gene transcription through phosphorylation of ERs or their associated coregulators.E2 – 17β-estradiol; ER – estrogen receptor; ERE – estrogen response element; P – phosphate group; TF – transcription factor; TF RE – transcription factor response element.</div></div>
