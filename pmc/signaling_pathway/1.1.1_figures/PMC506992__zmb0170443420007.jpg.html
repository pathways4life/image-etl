From: MUC20 Suppresses the Hepatocyte Growth Factor-Induced Grb2-Ras <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> by Binding to a Multifunctional Docking Site of Met. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of MUC20 suppression. (A) A MUC20 monomer has less ability to associate with Met. In this condition, Grb2 is recruited to HGF-activated Met, followed by activation of signaling cascades leading to proliferation. (B) MUC20 oligomerization caused by either an overproduction of MUC20 or an unknown endogenous factor(s) leads to the association with Met, blocking Grb2 recruitment to Met and suppressing the Grb2-Ras pathway, but does not affect Gab1 recruitment. The oligomerizing domain in MUC20 is referred to as the self-oligomerizing domain (SOD). PLCγ, phospholipase C-γ.</div></div>
