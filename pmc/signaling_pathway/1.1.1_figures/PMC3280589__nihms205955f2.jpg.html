From: Minireview: Rapid Glucocorticoid <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> via Membrane-Associated Receptors. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of rapid glucocorticoid signaling in PVN parvocellular neuroendocrine cells. A, Glucocorticoids (CORT) bind to a membrane-associated receptor (mbGR) and activate a G protein-dependent intracellular signaling pathway that leads to endocannabinoid (CB) synthesis and retrograde release. Endocannabinoids bind to presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors and suppress glutamate release from glutamate synapses onto the PVN neuron. B, Proposed membrane glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway. In this model, the membrane glucocorticoid receptor (mbGR) is a stimulatory G protein-coupled receptor (Gs) that, upon binding corticosterone (CORT), triggers the activation of adenylyl cyclase and the production of cAMP, resulting in increased PKA activity, which leads downstream to endocannabinoid synthesis from membrane lipid precursors followed by release.</div></div>
