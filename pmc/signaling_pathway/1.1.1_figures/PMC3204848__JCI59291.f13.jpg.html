Proposed mechanism for hyperglycemia-induced platelet hyperactivity through TX <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> mediated by the AR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>..  From: Glucose and collagen regulate human platelet activity through aldose reductase induction of thromboxane. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Hyperglycemia synergizes with collagen stimulation in platelets to activate the AR-dependent polyol pathway, leading to increased ROS production (via GSH depletion and NADH oxidase [Nox]). Excessive ROS can increase TXA2 production by potentiating PLCγ2/PKC/p38α MAPK signaling, thus providing more arachidonic acid substrate for COX-1 and TXA2 synthase (TS) to produce TXA2, leading to platelet hyperactivity. The oxidative stress can also lead to enhanced surface expression of TP, which increases the potency of circulating TXA2.    </div></div>
