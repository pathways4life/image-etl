The Notch/γ-secretase/Jagged signaling pathway is an important regulator of differentiation and helps specify cell fate. Notch signaling pathways have been shown to be activated in both breast CSCs and in endothelial cells in response to radiation. MK-0752 and R4733 are drugs under development targeting γ-secretase in this signaling pathway.</div></div>
