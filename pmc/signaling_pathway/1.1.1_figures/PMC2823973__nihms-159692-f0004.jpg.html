Specific inhibitors for the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (LY at 20 μM) and the Erk signaling pathway (PD) at 24-hour significantly reduced the promoter activity of Math1 induced by SHH (A). In contrast, CY and SB did not show any effect on the Math1 promoter activity. LY at 48-hour incubation canceled out the expression of Math1 in the nuclei by SHH (SHH+LY) in CNPs compared with control (B). Reduction of luciferase activity by LY and PD did not cause cellular apoptosis as judged by Annexin-V and 7-AAD (C). PD, PD98059; SB203580; LY, LY294002; CY, cyclopamine. Bar=10 μM applying to all panels in B.</div></div>
