The intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) domain and carboxyl terminal docking sites (Y1349 and Y1356) of Met are noted. Pathway inhibitors can be divided broadly into two subtypes (1) biological antagonists of HGF activation and HGF/Met binding, and (2) Met TK inhibitors (TKIs). Biological agents acting outside of the target cell (1) include anti-HGF and anti-Met mAbs, soluble Met ectodomain constructs and truncated HGF isoforms (all of which interfere with HGF/Met binding) and uncleavable forms of HGF (which competitively displace pro-HGF from its activators). Agents acting within the cell (2) include TKIs that competitively displace ATP from its TK domain binding site (TKI-1) and those which bind outside of the ATP binding pocket and inhibit Met TK activation allosterically (TKI-2).</div></div>
