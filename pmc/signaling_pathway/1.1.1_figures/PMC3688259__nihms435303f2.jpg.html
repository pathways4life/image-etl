B, PC-3 cells were treated with Cavsi or control NCsi. Both LNCaP and PC-3 cells were2 incubated for 48 hours and treated with rhWnt3a (25 ng/mL) for the indicated times. C, Cav-1 knockdown (Cavsh11 and Cavsh11G) and NC stable clones of DU145 cells were treated with rhWnt3a (25 ng/mL) for 45 minutes. D, PC-3 and LNCaP cells treated with rhWnt3a (50 ng/mL) and rhDKK1 (100 ng/mL) for 1 hour.</div></div>
