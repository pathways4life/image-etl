The TSLP pathway page in NetPath provides statistics pertaining to the number of molecules curated, links to TSLP pathway reactions and a list of genes that are differentially regulated by TSLP. Each molecule in the pathway page is linked to the corresponding NetPath molecule page, which is further linked to Entrez Gene, HPRD, OMIM and Swiss-Prot identifiers. The reaction page of the TSLP pathway contains a list of each type of reaction such as physical interactions, enzyme catalysis or transport with a brief description of the reactions including their PTM dependence or interacting regions/domains/motifs whenever available in literature. The list of curators and reviewers are provided in the TSLP pathway page with the details of the pathway authority. A comments tab is also provided.</div></div>
