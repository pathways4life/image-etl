From: MEK-ERK-dependent multiple caspase activation by mitochondrial proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is essential for heavy ion irradiation-induced glioma cell death. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic summary of the present findings. On the basis of the results of the current study, we propose that CB irradiation triggers reactivation of the MEK–ERK pathway subsequent to initial downregulation, which then initiates the mitochondrial pathway of caspase cascade activation, culminating in apoptotic death of glioma cells. Molecules involved in this cell death signaling pathway could be new targets for augmentation of CB therapy against gliomas. For instance, EGF may be used for MEK–ERK pathway activation, ABT-737 for the activation of mitochondrial apoptosis, and SMAC mimetics for caspase cascade activation</div></div>
