(A,B) Representative images and quantification of SPHK-1-GFP fluorescence of DA motor axons in the indicated strains. (C,D) Rates of paralysis on aldicarb (1.0 mM) for the indicated strains. For unc-73, the ce362 mutation was used. The indicated animals were pretreated with arecoline (15 mM in M9) or control (M9) for 2 h. (E) Model of the muscarinic signaling pathway in C. elegans cholinergic motor neurons that regulates SPHK-1 synaptic abundance and neurotransmitter release. Established model of the G-protein pathway in C. elegans motor neuron (Perez-Mansilla and Nurrish 2009), with novel components identified in this study shown in boxes. For quantification of SPHK-1-GFP, values are normalized to wild type (represented by dotted line); (*) P &lt; 0.05 (Student's t-test). Bars, 10 μm. Error bars are ±SEM for aldicarb curves, or ±propagated SEM for quantitative imaging.</div></div>
