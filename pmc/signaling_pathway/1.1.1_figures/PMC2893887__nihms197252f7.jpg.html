This signaling pathway controls cAMP production and leads to modulation of the F-actin cytoskeleton, thereby regulating signal relay and cell motility, respectively. The RasG-PI3K pathway appears to regulate F-actin, ACA (via CRAC), and PKB independently of the RasC-TORC2 pathway, and other regulators and/or Ras proteins control TORC2 activity in addition to RasC. It is also possible that RasC has other effectors. TORC2 and PKB/PKBR1 regulate RasC activity in a negative feedback fashion that involves regulation of the Sca1 complexâ€™s localization through phosphorylation of Sca1. PP2A seems to be necessary for the function of the Sca1 complex, possibly for the dynamic regulation of the complex by phosphorylation.</div></div>
