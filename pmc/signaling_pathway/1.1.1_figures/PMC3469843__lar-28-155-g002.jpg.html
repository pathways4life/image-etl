Total cell lysates were prepared from brain cortex of NSE/hAPPsw Tg mice treated with vehicle or RLP as described in the Materials and Methods. Fifty micrograms of protein per sample was immunoblotted with antibodies for each protein. Three samples were assayed in triplicate by Western blotting. Data are reported as the meanÂ±SD. *P&lt;0.05 is the significance level compared to cells treated with vehicle.</div></div>
