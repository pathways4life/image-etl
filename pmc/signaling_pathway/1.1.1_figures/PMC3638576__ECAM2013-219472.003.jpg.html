(a) SKOV-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of GTE (0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mg/mL) for 24 h. The expression of HER2 protein was measured by Western blotting. (b) SKOV-3 cells were treated with 0.5 mg/mL GTE for 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. The protein level of HER2 was determined by Western blotting. (c) Treatment of SKOV-3 cells with GTE (0, 0.25, or 0.5 mg/mL) for 24 h inhibited HER2/PI3K/Akt but not HER2/Erk signaling. (d) Treatment of SKBR-3 and BT-474 cells with GTE (0, 0.25, 0.5 mg/mL) for 24 h led to inhibition of the HER2/Akt but not the HER2/Erk signaling pathway. The results are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01.</div></div>
