Five differentially expressed mTOR signaling pathway genes identified by microarray were validated by Q-RT-PCR. The numerical value above each bar is the mean alteration of the gene by microarray analysis or Q-RT-PCR. AKT and VEGF were both up-regulated, and RPS6KB1, EIF4E and AMPK were all down-regulated in the HONE1-LMP1 cell line. Q-RT-PCR analysis of these genes was normalized to GAPDH, and repeated three times independently. The mean and standard deviation are shown.</div></div>
