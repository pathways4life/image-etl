From: MicroRNA Expression Profiling Reveals MiRNA Families Regulating Specific Biological Pathways in Mouse Frontal Cortex and Hippocampus. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Pathway analysis of predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNA families and clusters was carried out to assess their putative biological functions. Specific pathways that are predicted to be regulated by several miRNAs from the same family/cluster were identified (for a list of pathways see Table S2). (<b>a</b>) As an example, ceramide signaling pathway composed of miRNAs from miR-8 family and their predicted target genes is shown. (<b>b</b>) Dopamine signaling pathway including miR-34 family members and their predicted target genes.</div></div>
