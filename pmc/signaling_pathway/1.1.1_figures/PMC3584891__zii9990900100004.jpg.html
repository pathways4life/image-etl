From: Schistosome Egg Antigens Elicit a Proinflammatory Response by Trophoblast Cells of the Human Placenta. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The ERK1/2 and NF-κB signaling pathways are the dominant mediators of the proinflammatory cascade initiated by SEA in trophoblasts. Pharmacological inhibition of the JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 MAPK pathways as well as the NF-κB pathway prior to SEA (25 μg/ml) exposure for 24 h. (A, C, E, and G) IL-6 production after SEA with the addition of either vehicle (DMSO) or specific inhibitors. (B, D, F, and H) IL-8 production from the same experiments. (A and B) Inhibition of the ERK1/2 signaling pathways (n = 6). (C and D) Inhibition of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway (n = 6). (E and F) Inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway (n = 5). (G and H) Inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway (n = 6 individual trophoblast preparations from distinct placentas). All data are reported as means ± SEM. Unique letters denote statistically significant differences at P values of &lt;0.05.</div></div>
