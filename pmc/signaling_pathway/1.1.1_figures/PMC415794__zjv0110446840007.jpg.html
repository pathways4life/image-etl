Microphotographs of a tumor generated at 2 weeks by HaCaT cells expressing the shown gene combinations (A) or rafts generated from HaCaT cells stably expressing Neo, E6, and S82DL83W (B) were immunostained by using antibodies against phospho-MAPK1/2 and phospho-Akt. Tumors in panel A were also stained with anti-HPV-16/18 E6 antibody to confirm the expression of E6. Microphotographs were taken under 20Ã— magnification.</div></div>
