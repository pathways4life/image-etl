(<b>a</b>) The IL-7/Jak3/NFATc1 pathway functions as an alternative independent mechanism behind early T-cell development. Binding between IL-7 and the IL-7R induces the activation of Jak3, which phosphorylates Tyr371 of NFATc1, and facilitates NFATc1 translocation into the nucleus. This translocation produces downstream effectors that are involved in the function and differentiation of T cells. IL-7/Jak3/NFATc1 signaling cooperates with IL-7/Jak3/STAT5 signaling to synthesize Bcl-2, which is essential for early T-cell development. (<b>b</b>) IL-7 signaling regulates the homeostasis of CD8+ T cells in a duration-dependent manner. Intermittent IL-7 signaling together with TCRs is critical for the quiescence and survival of T cells. Continuous IL-7 signaling leads to the production of IFN-Î³, which triggers T-cell apoptosis, termed CICD. CICD, cytokine-induced cell death; IL-7R, IL-7 receptor; TCR, T-cell antigen receptor.</div></div>
