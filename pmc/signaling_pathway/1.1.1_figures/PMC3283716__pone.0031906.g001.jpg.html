A major <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> implicated in lung cancer is the EGFR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> which signals to both the AKT/PI3K <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> (green) and the MAPK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> (red) which regulate cell growth, proliferation and cell death..  From: A Novel Classification of Lung Cancer into Molecular Subtypes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">There is significant cross-talk between these pathways and their downstream effectors, which we have classified into 6 pathways for simplicity to account for differences in treatment modalities. The additional 4 pathways are: EGFR (blue), KRAS (yellow), EML4-ALK (orange), and P53/BCL (purple). It is thought that the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK pathway may be constitutively activated by the EML4-ALK fusion oncogene [100]. The complex relationship between this pathway and EML4-ALK is indicated with a dashed line.</div></div>
