Model of the ErbB2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> network that controls microtubule capture, microtubules stability and chemotaxis..  From: ErbB2-Dependent Chemotaxis Requires Microtubule Capture and Stabilization Coordinated by Distinct <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Our data show that ErbB2 controls microtubules via distinct, but complementary, signaling pathways. The Memo/RhoA and the PLCγ/cPKC pathways converge to control ACF7 localization at the leading edge, allowing microtubule capture. While PKCζ is also required downstream of PLCγ, its mode of action is still unknown. The PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to microtubule stability, at later stages, and involves the combined effect of the PAK/Stathmin pathway and repression of GSK3 activity. Microtubule capture and stabilization allow the chemotactic response to HRG.</div></div>
