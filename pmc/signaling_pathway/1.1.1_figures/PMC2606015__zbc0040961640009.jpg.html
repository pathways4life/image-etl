From: Mechanistic Analysis of the Amplification and Diversification Events  Induced by Vav Proteins in  B-lymphocytes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>A schematic view of the Vav family-regulated signaling pathways of DT40  B-cells.</b> The main signal transduction molecules with positive roles in  downstream signaling are indicated in black (the ones analyzed in  this work) and blue (the ones not analyzed in our experiments).  Putative negative regulators of B-cell signaling that could be operating in  this pathway are shown in red. The main second messengers are  indicated in green. Black thick arrows highlight the  prevalence of a signaling pathway over the rest of the signaling connections  presented in the figure. Gray arrows indicate pathways that have not  been demonstrated yet in DT40 cells. See main text for further  information.</div></div>
