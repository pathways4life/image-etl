Stimulates Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Secretion through Gβγ-Mediated <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">HFBF stimulates GLP-1 secretion through Gβγ pathway. Treatment of BF hexane fraction at 100 seconds into the medium increased the concentration of Ca2+ in cytosol. With BF hexane fraction, inhibitors were treated. (a) Gallein which is an inhibitor of Gβγ subunit-dependent signaling pathway reduced GLP-1 secretion dose dependently. (b) 2APB inhibits the IP3-induced Ca2+ release. 2APB also reduced GLP-1 secretion dose dependently. (c) U73122 is an inhibitor of PLC-dependent processes. With this inhibitor, concentration of Ca2+ showed less change despite treatment of BF hexane fraction. Data are means of intensity of the NCI-H716 cells (n = 10). ***P &lt; 0.0001 versus BF hexane fraction 100 μg/mL.</div></div>
