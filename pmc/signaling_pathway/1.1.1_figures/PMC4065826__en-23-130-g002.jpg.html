NRG1-ErbB2 signaling regulates SC plasticity via c-jun expression which is mediated by JNK and p38 kinase pathways. c-jun increases the expression of GDNF and LIF but suppresses the crucial transcription factor for myelination, Krox20, thereby inducing SC dedifferentiation. The Raf-ERK pathway is involved in the expression of cell cycle proteins and chemotactic factors such as Ccl2.</div></div>
