CXCL12/CXCR4 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways and their regulation.  From: Multiple roles of chemokine CXCL12 in the central nervous system: A migration from immunology to neurobiology. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4 activates multiple G-protein-mediated signaling pathways (such as PI3K, MAPKs and NFκB) and induces the release of intracellular Ca2+. These signaling pathways are involved in cell proliferation, migration and survival or apoptosis. Activation of CXCR4 leads to GRK/β-arrestin-mediated receptor desensitization and prevents CXCR4 from further interacting with G proteins. GRK/β-arrestin promotes clathin-dependent endocytosis that is coupled to receptor trafficking, degradation and resensitization. β-arrestin2 may modulate CXCR4-mediated activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway.</div></div>
