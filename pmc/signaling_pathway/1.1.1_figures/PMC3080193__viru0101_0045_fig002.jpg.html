(A) Hsp90 could interact with a positive regulator of the cAMP-PKA pathway and maintain it in an inactive, but active competent state. This could involve Hsp90 interacting the positive catalytic subunits of PKA, Tpk1 or Tpk2. (B) Hsp90 could stabilize a negative regulator of the cAMP-PKA pathway, such that inhibiting Hsp90 would destabilize the negative regulator. This could involve Hsp90 interacting the negative regulatory subunit of PKA, Bcy1. (C) Hsp90 might interact indirectly with the cAMP-PKA pathway. This could occur via a positive regulator such as Tpk1 or Tpk2, or by a negative regulator. More complex models are possible, where Hsp90 could regulate cAMP-PKA signaling via multiple client proteins.</div></div>
