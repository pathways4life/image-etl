Increased Bcl-xL expression and binding to Bax, as well as Akt activation inhibits NMDA or glutamate-induced neuronal death. <b>B</b>, IL-6/R and OSM also induce SOCS3 expression in a STAT3-dependent fashion. SOCS3, in turn, modulates IL-6/R or OSM induced Bcl-xL expression and Akt signaling pathway in a negative regulatory manner, which contributes, in part, to NMDA or glutamate-induced neuronal death.</div></div>
