MT1-MMP regulates cell migration through both ECM proteolysis and non-proteolytic-dependent TIMP-2 activation of ERK1/2 pathway. MT1-MMP regulates VEGF gene expression through Src, Akt, and mTOR activation and stimulates tumor angiogenesis. In addition, it induces RANKL shedding and signaling through Src leading to cell migration. MT1-MMP cooperates with platelet derived S1P to induce signaling through G protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs) and regulates endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis. MT1-MMP regulates TGFβ bioavailability and its signaling through ALK5 leading to vessel maturation. Shedding of Tie-2 or degradation of decorin by MT1-MMP stimulates angiogenesis, but shedding of endoglin from endothelial cell surface inhibits angiogenesis. ProTGFβ can also be activated by MMP2 and MMP9. MT1-MMP activates PDGFRβ signaling and regulates pericyte migration and vessel maturation. MT4-MMP a metastatic MMP, is highly expressed by cancer cells and induces tumor vessel destabilization through pericyte detachment.</div></div>
