This cartoon of TSC mediated signaling has been simplified to highlight the demonstrated biologic roles for TSC mediated mTOR signaling in the nervous system. Among the upstream signaling pathways, only the growth factors and ephrins have been shown to modulate TSC-mTOR pathway in neurons (growth factors, ephrins) while others (e.g. Wnts) have been implicated, but not proven to regulate TSC signaling in the nervous system.</div></div>
