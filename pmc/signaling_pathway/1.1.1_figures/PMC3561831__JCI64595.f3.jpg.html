(<b>B</b>) In early AD, accumulation of AβOs stimulates TNF-α signaling, which activates the JNK pathway (11, 54) and, possibly, PKR and IKK pathways. Activation of these stress-sensitive kinases, which can also be triggered by ER stress in peripheral tissues (69), results in IRS-1pSer, decreasing downstream insulin signaling (11, 31, 54). This contributes to initial cognitive impairment in early AD. (<b>C</b>) At later AD stages, increased accumulation of AβOs and their binding to synapses lead to removal of IRs from the neuronal plasma membrane (14, 15, 47). Additionally, TNF-α/JNK activation ultimately blocks insulin actions (11), contributing to severe impairment in cognition and memory. (<b>D</b>) Stimulation of insulin and GLP-1Rs blocks early AβO-induced defects in insulin signaling. Insulin protects neurons by preventing AβO binding to neurons (15). In addition, activation of GLP-1Rs by exendin-4 or liraglutide and of IRs by insulin prevents JNK activation, allowing physiological tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and stimulating downstream insulin signaling. (<b>E</b>) At later AD stages, activation of GLP-1Rs prevents inhibitory IRS-1pSer, stimulating insulin-related downstream signaling pathways and ameliorating cognitive and memory impairment.
