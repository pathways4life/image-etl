From: Knockdown of Aurora-B inhibits osteosarcoma cell invasion and migration via modulating PI3K/Akt/NF-?B <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Inhibiting Aurora-B suppressed the expression of p-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt and NF-κB proteins in U-2 OS and HOS cells. The OS cells were infected with LV-AURKB or LV-NC for 8 h, cultured for 72 h, and then lysed. The protein was quantified, separated with 8% SDS-PAGE and assayed by Western-Blot. This is a representative image of the six experiments shown for each groups. It show that with the silencing of Aurora-B, the p-PI3K, PI3K, p-Akt and NF-κB proteins were blockaded in varying degrees, which indicated that Aurora-B may down-regulate the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway.</div></div>
