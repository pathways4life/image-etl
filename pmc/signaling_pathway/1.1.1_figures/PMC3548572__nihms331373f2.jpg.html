The VEGFA pathway is known to phosphorylate and activate, among other factors, MAPK signaling cascades, which includes both p38 and ERK. Canonical BMP signaling activates Smads however BMP stimulation has been shown to effectively activate MAPK signaling cascades as well. During angiogenesis, BMP requires activation of ERK and not p38 [47].</div></div>
