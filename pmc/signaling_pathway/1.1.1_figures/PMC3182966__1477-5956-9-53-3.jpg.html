The regulation of AKT signaling pathway. Calyculin A is a phosphotase inhibitor leading to phospho-AKT accumulation. LY294002 inhibits PI3K phosphorylation therefore blocks the activation of downstream AKT signaling pathway. <b>B</b>. Cells were treated with inhibitors or serum as indicated to alter AKT activity. RPPA probed with either total AKT or phospho-AKT antibodies. All the samples were spotted in triplicates with 5 serial dilutions. <b>C</b>. Corresponding Western blots using the same lysates in <b>B</b>.</div></div>
