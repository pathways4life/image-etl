At this stage, signaling can involve post-translational modifications of proteins (PTM), formation of complexes (scaffolds), modification of lipids and enzyme cascade activation (GTPases, kinases). Activated complexes can then translocate in the nucleus where transcriptional activation processes can take place, followed by mRNA maturation, expression and translation into active proteins.</div></div>
