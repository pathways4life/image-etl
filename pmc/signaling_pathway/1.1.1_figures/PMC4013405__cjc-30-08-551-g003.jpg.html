MAPK activation functions with the PI3K/Akt and the EGFR/Raf/MAPK signaling pathways, both activated by Ca2+ influx through nAChRs, to induce phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors, further regulate downstream gene transcription and protein expression, provoke cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, tumor invasion, and therapy resistance.</div></div>
