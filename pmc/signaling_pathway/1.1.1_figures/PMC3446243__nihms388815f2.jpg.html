Arrows indicate activation of the signaling pathway; the “⊣” signs indicate inhibition of the signaling pathway. Both immune and neuronal cells express opioid receptors. Modulation of NF-κB signaling leads to the regulation of a variety of genes, including the opioid receptor genes and proinflammatory genes. Nitration or nitrosylation of NF-κB may be one of the feedback mechanisms of controlling homeostasis of NF-κB signaling in vivo. Deregulation of NF-κB signaling could result in opioid-mediated immunosuppression, cell survival, morphine tolerance, and physical dependence. MEKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; IκB, inhibitor of κB protein; p65, NF-κB/p65 subunit; p50, NF-κB/p50 subunit; iNO, inducible NO.</div></div>
