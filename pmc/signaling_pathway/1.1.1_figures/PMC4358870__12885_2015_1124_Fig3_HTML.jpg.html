(A)</b> Slu-01 cells stably overexpressing AEG-1 were established. GSK-3β was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and its expression was confirmed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. <b>(B)</b> CKIδ was critical for AEG-1-mediated regulation of GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling and EMT. AEG-1 complexes were associated with both GSK-3β and CKIδ. <b>(C)</b> CKIδplayed a role in AEG-mediated regulation of EMT and Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β. Slu-01 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-AEG-1 were co-transfected with CKIδ-specific siRNA. Cell lysates were then subjected to Western blotting.</div></div>
