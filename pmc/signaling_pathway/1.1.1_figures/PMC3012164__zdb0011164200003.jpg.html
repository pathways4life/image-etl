A: Schematic of one arm of the IR signaling pathway with MAPK pathway highlighted. B: Cells were treated as in Fig. 1A, cross-linked, and used in ChIP with antibodies to Raf-B, Raf-B phosphorylated at T598 and S601 (pRaf-B), MEK1/2, MEK1/2 phosphorylated at S217/S221 (pMEK), ERK 1, and ERK1/2 phosphorylated at T202/Y204 (pERK). ChIPed DNA was used in PCR as in Fig. 1C. Data represent mean Â± SEM for three independent experiments.</div></div>
