Schematic model for the mechanism of JNK mediated activation of the p53 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> in RITA-induced MM cells..

Pharmacological (SP600125) or genetic inhibition (JNK siRNA) of activation of c-Jun inhibits RITA-induced activation of p53 and attenuate apoptosis induction by RITA. In addition, treatment of MM cells with p53-transcriptional inhibitor, PFT-Î± or p53 siRNA abrogates RITA-induced activation of c-Jun and induction of apoptosis. These results suggest the presence of a positive feedback loop between p53 and JNK. Depending on the cellular context, p53 can be directly activated by JNK, although the mechanism is not clear.</div></div>
