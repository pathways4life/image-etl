From: Smad4 is critical for self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Model for the regulation of HSC self-renewal by the Smad signaling pathway.</b> The canonical Smad pathway inhibits HSC expansion. This inhibition can be relieved upon enforced expression of the inhibitory Smad7. Recently, TIF1Î³ has been shown to compete with Smad4 for binding of R-Smads, leading to differentiation of primitive cells into erythrocytes. In addition to its inhibitory role in HSCs as a critical partner in the canonical Smad pathway, Smad4 has a positive effect on self-renewal, possibly as a transducer of unknown regulators outside this pathway.</div></div>
