From: C-Type Lectin-Like Receptors of the Dectin-1 Cluster: Ligands and <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"> <b>Signaling network of Dectin-1.</b> Multiple pathways downstream of Dectin-1 rely on Syk. This can lead to PLCγ2/Ca2+ signaling leading to PKCδ activation that controls calcineurin/NFAT and ROS/NLRP3 inflammasome, and the phosphorylation of CARD9-Bcl10-Malt1. The CARD9 complex is able to activate all NF-κB subunits including c-Rel by removing its inhibitor, IκB, through activation of the IKK complex. Syk can also activate IKK complex through the non-canonical NIK pathway, leading to the activation of NF-κB subunits RelB and p52. This pathway can be inhibited the Raf-1-mediated pathway involving p65. Phosphorylated and acetylated p65 can interact with RelB, sequestering it away from an active NF-κB complex. Resultant activation of NFAT and NF-κB results in modification of gene transcription including cytokines and chemokines. Dashed arrows represent a pathway that has yet to be fully defined.</div></div>
