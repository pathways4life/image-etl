From: Role of NF-?B in the skeleton. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Crosstalk between RANKL- and TNF-induced NF-κB signaling in OCs. RANKL activates the alternative NF-κB pathway by blocking TRAF3-mediated NIK degradation, leading to nuclear translocation of RelB/p52 dimers. Transcriptional targets of this pathway provide signals for OC differentiation and function. RANKL also activates the classical pathway downstream of the IKK complex, supporting OC lineage cell survival downstream of p65/p50. TNF also activates the classical NF-κB pathway, which blocks apoptosis, upregulates p100/RelB expression, and may support OC differentiation. TNF also stabilizes TRAF3, which can inhibit NIK.</div></div>
