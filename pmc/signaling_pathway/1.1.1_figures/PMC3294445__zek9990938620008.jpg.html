From: Vacuolar H+-ATPase Works in Parallel with the HOG <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> To Adapt Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cells to Osmotic Stress. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">V-ATPase is important in salt detoxification during hyperosmotic stress. The HOG MAPK signaling pathway and the V-ATPase act in parallel pathways to mitigate osmotic shock during salt stress. Activation of the HOG pathway leads to changes in gene expression that promote production of glycerol, an osmoprotectant. The HOG pathway also activates transporters at the plasma membrane, resulting in the extrusion of NaCl into the extracellular space. On the other hand, the V-ATPase becomes activated in response to salt stress, and higher activation of the enzyme is required for the activity of vacuolar cation transporters that recruit excess sodium ions into the vacuolar lumen.</div></div>
