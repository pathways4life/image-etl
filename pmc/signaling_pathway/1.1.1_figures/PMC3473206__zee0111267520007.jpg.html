From: Dual Role for Glucocorticoids in Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy and Apoptosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Microarray analysis of glucocorticoid-regulated genes in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Global gene expression analysis was performed on RNA isolated from H9C2 cardiomyocytes treated with vehicle or 100 nm Dex for 6, 24, or 48 h in the presence or absence of serum. Genes significantly regulated by Dex were determined by ANOVA (P &lt; 0.01) and analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. A, The number of genes induced and repressed by Dex at each time point in cells cultured with or without serum. B, Venn diagram of Dex-regulated genes at 6-, 24-, and 48-h time points in cardiomyocytes cultured in the presence or absence of serum. C, The cardiac hypertrophy signaling canonical pathway was significantly altered in serum-supplemented H9C2 cells treated with glucocorticoids. Shown are the 58 genes in this pathway that were regulated by Dex at the 48-h time point. D, The apoptosis signaling canonical pathway was significantly altered in serum-deprived H9C2 cells treated with glucocorticoids. Shown are the 15 genes in this pathway that were regulated by Dex at the 48-h time point. Red indicates increased expression, and green indicates decreased expression.</div></div>
