(A) Time-course expression of miR-15b and miR-221 normalized to U6 small nuclear RNA was examined by qRT-PCR in PASMC treated with PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for the time indicated. (B) Time-course analysis of the relative expression of miR-15b or miR-21 normalized to U6 small nuclear RNA in PASMC stimulated with BMP4 for the time indicated. The average of 3 experiments, each performed in triplicate, is presented with S.E..
