A guanine nucleotide exchange protein C3G, which associates with SH3 domain of v-Crk, can presumably activate Ras-like small G protein and generate signal for the activation of Jun kinase. The well established Grb2-mediated signaling pathway from tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor localized in the plasma membrane through Sos to the activation of MAPK is also described as a comparison of different signaling pathways mediated by two adaptor molecules.</div></div>
