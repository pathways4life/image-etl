B, Signaling pathways for the novel membrane ER (mER). 1) Estrogen can activate the classical ER-mediated (ERα/β) pathways leading to changes in mRNA transcription of relevant genes via ERE. 2) Both ERs are regulated by STX, and may be a mechanism for the interaction of classical ER and mER signaling. 3) Estrogen can bind to membrane-associated classical ER leading to the activation of signal transduction pathways to control gene transcription and cellular functions. The putative mER is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) linked to Gq/11 protein that activates PLC-PKC-PKA pathway may control gene transcription via pCREB-CRE. The activation of PKC can also lead to changes in gene transcription via the phosphorylation of other signaling proteins (MAPK/ERK). 4) The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) may also initiate calcium-dependent signaling molecules (CaM/CaMK) to control transcription. Several of these genes are associated with cation and anion channels (Cav3.1, GLR) or proteins that impinge on channel functions (AKAP). 5) Changes in neuronal excitability either by channel expression or channel modulation may also control gene expression. A few of the genes analyzed by qPCR are involved in calcium signaling (CaMK II) and protein trafficking (GEC1).</div></div>
