Animals were fed bacteria containing either control vector, L4440 or vectors producing gene-specific dsRNA. Numbers on the side of the bars represent the total number of animals examined. The bars show the percentage of animals that developed into L4 larvae or adults (grey) and those that arrested as dauers (black). RNAi experiments were diluted with control L4440 RNAi to match the mixed akt-1 and akt-2 RNAi dose. akt-1, akt-2 and pdk-1 RNAi experiments were conducted on wildtype, age-1(mg109), age-1(mg109);akt-1(mg247) and age-1(mg109);pdk-1(mg261) animals</div></div>
