Early, intermediate, and late stages in the reprogramming of ETP or DN2 cells by forced expression of GATA-3. The stages where Notch signaling exerts inhibition are shown. Adapted from Supplementary Figure 6, ref. [36]. Note that susceptibility of cells to these interactions is limited to the stages before DN3, when an unidentified commitment function blocks access to the mast-cell pathway.</div></div>
