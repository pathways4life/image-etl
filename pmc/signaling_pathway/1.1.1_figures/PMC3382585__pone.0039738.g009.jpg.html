(b) Western blot showed that uric acid induced IκB phosphorylation in vivo. (c) Graphic presentation of relative phospho-p65 NF-κB and phospho-IκB protein abundance normalized to p65 NF-κB and IκB, respectively. *P&lt;0.05 versus control (n = 3). (d) Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that p65 NF-κB underwent nuclear translocation in kidney of hyperuricemia mice. Kidney sections were immunostained for total p65 (red) and the nuclei (blue). Arrowheads indicate nuclear staining of p65 NF-κB. (e) Enlarged image shows nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB in tubules of hyperuricemia mice (day 7) demonstrated by immunofluorescent staining.</div></div>
