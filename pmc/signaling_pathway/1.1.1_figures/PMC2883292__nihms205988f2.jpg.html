Several different types of receptors can activate PI-3 kinase-Akt signaling through upstream mediators including ILK, Src, and IRS1/2. PI-3 kinase can directly activate Akt or indirectly through activation of PDK1 via the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 which is mediated by PI-3 kinase. Akt phosphorylates numerous downstream signaling proteins resulting in positive regulation of mTOR and negative regulation of GSK-3, FKHR, and Bad among other targets. Inhibition of PI-3 kinase-Akt signaling includes ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 inhibition of IRS-1 as well as Akt inhibition by TRB3. Not shown is the regulation of these pathways by phosphatases which include PTEN, SHP-2, and PP2A, among others.</div></div>
