Expression of human PDGFr-β. Western immunoblotting analyses with mouse monoclonal anti-human PDGFr-β monoclonal antibodies ab10847 to determine expression of human PDGFr-β in response to various treatments. The bands were detected with ImmunoPure goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L), peroxidase conjugated antibodies 31430. The lower panel is the same membrane probed with rabbit anti-β-actin mAb 13E5. The bar graph represents protein band intensity normalized to the protein load as measured by the intensity of β-actin band using ImageJ.</div></div>
