From: Dynamic Expression of Notch <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Genes in Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>The core pathway of Notch signaling</b>. Proneural genes such as Mash1 and Ngn2 promote neuronal differentiation and induce the expression of Dll1, which in turn activates Notch in neighboring cells. Upon activation of Notch, the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released from the transmembrane portion and transferred to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA-binding protein Rbpj and the transcriptional co-activator Maml. The NICD–Rbpj–Maml complex induces the expression of transcriptional repressor genes such as Hes1 and Hes5. Hes1 and Hes5 then repress the expression of proneural genes and Dll1, thereby leading to the maintenance of neural stem/progenitor cells. Numb inhibits Notch signaling and induces neuronal differentiation.</div></div>
