Erb signal transduction pathway inferred with BowTieBuilder. Membrane-bound proteins are depicted at the top, TFs are depicted at the bottom, and the inferred proteins are depicted in between. The core proteins are embedded in a gray box, in which their bow tie score is provided. For the inferred Erb pathway, however, no core element could be determined. The recall and precision values are given in Table 1.</div></div>
