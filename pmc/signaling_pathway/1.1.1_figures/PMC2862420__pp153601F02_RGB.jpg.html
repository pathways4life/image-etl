From: Detoxification without Intoxication: Herbicide Safeners Activate Plant Defense Gene Expression1[C]. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Possible safener-mediated signaling pathways for the regulation of defense genes and activation of detoxification pathways in plants. Safeners may tap into a RES oxylipin-mediated signaling pathway (e.g. OPDA and PPA1) and up-regulate TGA transcription factors (for review, see Mueller and Berger, 2009), an Nrf2-Keap1-mediated signaling pathway (Nguyen et al., 2009), and/or a JA-mediated signaling pathway (Schaller and Stintzi, 2009; Zander et al., 2010) to induce the expression of proteins involved in herbicide detoxification in plants. It is also possible that safeners may utilize an unknown (?) signaling pathway to trigger plant defense gene expression. Dashed lines indicate possible but unproven signaling pathways, and solid lines indicate known signaling pathways for the regulation of plant gene expression. Note that the three distinct “Gene Expression” boxes indicate that only a subset of GST enzymes can metabolize herbicides or safeners as substrates, leading to detoxification and herbicide tolerance in cereal crops. CoI1, Coronatine-insensitive protein1; JAZ, transcriptional repressor protein; TF, transcription factor/activator. [See online article for color version of this figure.]</div></div>
