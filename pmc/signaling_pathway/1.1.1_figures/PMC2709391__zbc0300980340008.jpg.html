From: Loss of Cardiolipin Leads to Longevity Defects That Are Alleviated by Alterations in Stress Response <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Perturbation of PKC and HOG signaling in pgs1Δ.</b> Under hypertonic or cold stress conditions, extracellular osmolarity is increased, which causes an efflux of water from the cell, reducing the turgor pressure on the cell wall. Activation of the HOG pathway by increased osmolarity leads to increased intracellular turgor pressure to counteract the extracellular osmolarity. In contrast, low extracellular osmolarity resulting from heat or hypotonic stress causes an influx of water into the cell, which increases the turgor pressure. To withstand the increased turgor pressure, the PKC-Slt2 pathway is activated to induce cell wall synthesis (30, 55–58). Loss of PG/CL may generate a signal (as yet unidentified) that is detected by regulators or components of the PKC-Slt2 pathway, resulting in down-regulation of the pathway. In this case, activation of the HOG pathway will exacerbate the cell wall defects in pgs1Δ cells by further increasing the turgor pressure.</div></div>
