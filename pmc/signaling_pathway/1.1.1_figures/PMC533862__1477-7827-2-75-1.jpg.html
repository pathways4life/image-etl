From: Role of tyrosine phosphorylation in sperm capacitation / acrosome reaction. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Heuristic model showing the tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathways in sperm cell involved in capacitation</b>. There seems to be three major signaling pathways operating in sperm cell, namely cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway (pathway I), receptor tyrosine kinase pathway (pathway II), and non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase pathway (pathway III). The pathway I, that is exclusive only to sperm cells, seems to be the major pathway among the three pathways. These cascades may not be mutually exclusive and include cross-talk among several molecules. Many key molecules and receptors are still to be identified to completely elucidate the molecular mechanism and signal transduction cascade involved in capacitation. G-protein coupled receptor pathway has not been included in this model.</div></div>
