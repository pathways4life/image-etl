(<b>B</b>) The network of known or  proposed signaling pathways controlling eyelid development. Observations made  in this study are indicated by blue arrows, previous findings by orange arrows  and findings confirmed in this study by green arrows. Our model suggests that  epidermal cell fate is the default pathway and that BMP signaling is required  for prospective conjunctival epithelial cells to suppress the epidermal  differentiation pathway and become conjunctival cells. BMP signaling is not  required to initiate the migration of periderm cells at the lid margins, but  is required for the expansion of these cells across the corneal surface.  During this process, BMP signaling is required for the expression of Foxc1 and  Foxc2, and for the full activation (phosphorylation) of c-Jun. BMP-dependent  formation of active R-Smad-Smad4 complexes is required for the translocation  of p-c-Jun into the nuclei of periderm cells, where it has been reported to  increase the expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor.</div></div>
