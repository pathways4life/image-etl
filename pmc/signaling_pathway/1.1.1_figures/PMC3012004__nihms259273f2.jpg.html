From: Targeting the RTK-PI3K-mTOR Axis in Malignant Glioma: Overcoming Resistance. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Sites of action for inhibitors and shRNAs in the EGFR-PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. Agents that inhibit the EGFR-PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway at multiple sites may contribute to anticancer effects in malignant glioma. Agents that inhibit only one target within the EGFR-PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis generally show only modest efficacy and fail to induce appreciable apoptosis. This disappointing efficacy stems in-part from multiple nodes of activation in the EGFR-PI3K-Akt-mTOR axis. For example, loss of PTEN activates PI3K signaling. A feedback loop between S6K and IRS-1 also lead to PI3K activation. Inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway may also induce autophagy, enabling cancer cells to survive some small molecule inhibitors of this pathway</div></div>
