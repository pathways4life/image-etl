From: Disruption of the Dapper3 Gene Aggravates Ureteral Obstruction-mediated Renal Fibrosis by Amplifying Wnt/?-catenin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Schematic diagram illustrates the role of Dapper3 in UUO-induced renal fibrosis by regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.</b> The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is activated by UUO and contributes to renal fibrosis. Dapper3 induces Dvl degradation and thus attenuates Wnt signaling. Ablation of Dapper3 leads to increased protein levels of Dvl and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, further activating fibrotic gene expression and causing aggravated renal fibrosis. TCF, T cell factor; LEF, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor; Fz, Frizzled.</div></div>
