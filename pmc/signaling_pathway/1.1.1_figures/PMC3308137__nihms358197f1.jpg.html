A miRNA can perform a stress signal mediation function (A) in which it acts as a critical intermediate in a signaling pathway or it may act as a stress signal modulator (B) in which it titrates a signaling intermediate. A miRNA may participate in a negative (C) or positive (D) feedback loop which serves to dampen or amplify a signal, respectively. Lastly, a miRNA may target both positive and negative regulators of a pathway (E), thereby buffering pathway activity from stochastic fluctuation. For each mode of regulation, the consequences of deletion of the miRNA on pathway activity are schematized on the right.</div></div>
