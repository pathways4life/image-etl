The HIV-1 protein Tat, acting via intact lipid rafts, activates RhoA and ROCK kinases, leading to inhibition of MLCP (via phosphorylation of MYPT-1) and increased phosphorylation of MLC. This study provides novel evidence that these events are involved in the regulation of P-gp expression.</div></div>
