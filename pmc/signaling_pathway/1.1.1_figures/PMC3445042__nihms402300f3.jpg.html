(A) pH3+ and BrdU+/Sox3+ cell numbers in the 32hpf hypothalamus following 2 hour labeling and Wnt pathway inhibition or activation at 24hpf. (B) BrdU+ cell numbers in the 4dpf posterior recess following 2 hour labeling and Wnt pathway inhibition or activation at 3dpf. (C) BrdU+ cell fates in the 4dpf hypothalamus following labeling and Wnt pathway inhibition or activation at 3dpf. (D) Percentage of BrdU+ cells expressing dlx5/6:gfp following Wnt pathway activation at 3dpf. (E) BrdU+ cell fates in the adult hypothalamus following 2 day labeling and Wnt pathway inhibition or activation for 15 days. (F) Number of Gal4+ and BLBP+ cells in the 4dpf posterior recess following Wnt pathway inhibition or activation at 3dpf. All cell counts were collected from ventral maximum intensity confocal Z-projections through 5 individual brains. The entire hypothalamus was counted at 32hpf, the entire posterior recess was counted at 4dpf, and a hemisphere of the posterior recess was counted in adults. *: p&lt;0.05, **: p&lt;0.005.
