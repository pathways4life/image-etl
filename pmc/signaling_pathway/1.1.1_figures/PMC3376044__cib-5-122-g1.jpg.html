From: Comparative analysis of calcineurin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> between Candida dubliniensis and Candida albicans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Figure 1.</b> Comparison of the calcineurin pathway in C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. The roles of calcineurin and Crz1 in hyphal growth are unclear in C. albicans (dotted arrows) while their roles in hyphal growth of C. dubliniensis (right panel) are demonstrable. Calcineurin is required for virulence in both Candida species. ER stress responses are controlled by Crz1-dependent and Crz1-independent calcineurin signaling in C. albicans and C. dubliniensis, respectively. Drug tolerance and alkaline pH homeostasis are governed by the Crz1-dependent calcineurin pathway in both Candida species. C. dubliniensis calcineurin plays a larger role (bold arrow) in controlling acidic pH homeostasis compared with C. albicans. In C. albicans calcineurin plays a greater role (bold arrow) in serum survival compared with C. dubliniensis.</div></div>
