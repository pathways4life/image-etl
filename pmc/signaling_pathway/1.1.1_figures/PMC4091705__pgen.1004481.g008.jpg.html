In the absence of Wnt, APR-1 is active and inhibits BAR-1. In the presence of Wnt, APR-1 is inhibited and BAR-1 activity is increased. Higher levels of BAR-1 lead to increased nuclear import and activation of the transcription factor POP-1 (TCF/LEF). We have shown that RPM-1 binds to ANC-1, and RPM-1 and ANC-1 function in the same pathway to positively regulate BAR-1 activity. RPM-1 and ANC-1 are likely to function in a protein complex at the nuclear envelope to regulate BAR-1 nuclear levels by inhibition of EMR-1. Canonical Wnt signaling is likely to act coordinately with RPM-1 and ANC-1 to regulate BAR-1 activity.</div></div>
