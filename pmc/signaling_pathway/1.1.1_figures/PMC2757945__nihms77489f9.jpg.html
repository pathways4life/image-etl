(1) At early stages of lung development (E10–E12), FGF9 is produced by lung mesothelium and epithelium and signals to mesenchymal FGFR1c and FGFR2c to maintain mesenchymal proliferation (Colvin et al., 2001; White et al., 2006). In the absence of Fgf9, expression of the mesenchymal WNT-β-Catenin pathway ligand, Wnt2a, and target gene, Lef1, was down-regulated. When FGF9 was overexpressed in airway epithelium, Wnt2a, and the β-Catenin target gene, Lef1, were both up-regulated. This suggests a signaling pathway in which mesenchymal FGFR activation regulates Wnt2a expression (2) and mesenchymal WNT-β-Catenin signaling. (3) Inactivation of mesenchymal β-Catenin resulted in decreased expression of Lef1 mRNA and protein, decreased expression of CyclinD1 and decreased mesenchymal proliferation, suggesting that mesenchymal WNT signaling could mediate, in part, FGF regulated mesenchymal proliferation. (4) Inactivation of mesenchymal β-Catenin also resulted in decreased expression of FGFR1 and FGFR2 in lung mesenchyme, suggesting that feedback through FGFR signaling may contribute to the ability of mesenchymal WNT signaling to regulate proliferation (5) and Wnt2a expression (2). (6) Wnt7b is expressed in airway epithelium and likely signals to mesenchyme to regulate WNT-β-Catenin signaling.
