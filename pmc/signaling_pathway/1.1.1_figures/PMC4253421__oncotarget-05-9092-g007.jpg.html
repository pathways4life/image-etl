Proposed model of the LGR5-mediated promotion of cervical cancer growth via the Wnt/β-catenin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>.

A series of steps ensue, including the accumulation of β-catenin, which is translocated to the nucleus and, together with the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors, increases related gene expression, ultimately leading to the progression of cervical cancer.</div></div>
