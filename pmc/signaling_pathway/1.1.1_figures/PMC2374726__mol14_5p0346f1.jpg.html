From: Functional Consequences of Toll-like Receptor 4 Polymorphisms. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic overview of the LPS TLR4 signaling pathway. Recognition of LPS is established by the interplay between lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins (LBPs) and CD14 that transfer the LPS to the MD-2/TLR4 complex. Dimerization of TLR4 then initiates downstream intracellular signaling transduction through Toll-interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains and several adaptor molecules. Eventually, the intracellular signaling results in the activation of specific pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles by the MYD88-dependent or TRIF-dependent pathway.</div></div>
