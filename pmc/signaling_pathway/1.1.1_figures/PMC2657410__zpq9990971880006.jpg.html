(A) RTK-activated tumor cells: feedback inhibition occurs at multiple levels of the pathway, down-regulating both RAF/MEK activation and ERK phosphorylation levels. Steady-state levels of pERK are caused by low levels of both MEK activity and ERK dephosphorylation by DUSPs. Output of the pathway is low. (B) V600EBRAF cells: RAF kinase is active and insusceptible to negative feedback. Increased pathway output leads to increased DUSP6 expression. Steady-state levels of pERK are caused by high levels of MEK and DUSP6 dephosphorylation of ERK.</div></div>
