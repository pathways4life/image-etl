With a low level of IS (the rightmost cell), the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway is below the threshold needed for induction (indicated in grey), and the VPC adopts the 3° fate. A high level of IS (the leftmost cell) activates the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway and induces the 1° fate. High IS also results in the production of a strong lateral signal (LS) by this VPC, the downregulation of LIN-12, and, as predicted by our computational model (see below), in the inhibition of the lst genes as indicated by the red line. The middle VPC receives a medium IS; however, the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway is counteracted (indicated in grey) by the lst genes activated by the strong LS from the leftmost VPC. The middle VPC thus adopts the 2° fate.</div></div>
