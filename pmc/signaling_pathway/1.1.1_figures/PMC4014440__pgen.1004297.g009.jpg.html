Summary of RPM-1 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>..  From: RPM-1 Uses Both Ubiquitin Ligase and Phosphatase-Based Mechanisms to Regulate DLK-1 during Neuronal Development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">RPM-1 is a positive regulator of the GLO-4 pathway, and acts as part of a complex with FSN-1 that ubiquitinates and negatively regulates DLK-1. PPM-2 is also part of an RPM-1 protein complex and negatively regulates DLK-1 via dephosphorylation at S874.</div></div>
