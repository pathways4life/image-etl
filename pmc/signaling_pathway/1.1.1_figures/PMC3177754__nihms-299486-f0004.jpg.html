RLR-NLR interactions in <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> against pathogens.  From: RIG-I Like Receptors and Their <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Crosstalk in the Regulation of Antiviral Immunity. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The NOD2 signaling pathway for recognition of bacterial and viral PAMPs is shown on the left. NOD2 is triggered by bacterial MDP to activate NF-κB while ssRNA from RSV leads to activation of IRF-3 signaling. The RIG-I Inflammasome is depicted on the right. Both RIG-I and MDA5 can interact with CARD9/BCL10 to activate NF-κB. This leads to induction of pro-IL-1β. RIG-I but not MDA5 can directly associate with ASC bifurcating NLR mediated activation of Caspase-1. This leads to cleavage of IL-1β and secretion from the cell.</div></div>
