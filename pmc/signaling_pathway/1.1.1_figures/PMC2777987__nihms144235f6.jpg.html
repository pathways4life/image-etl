Regulation of Cellular Circadian Clock by Components in Insulin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>.  From: A Genome-Wide RNAi Screen for Modifiers of the Circadian Clock in Human Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Insulin signaling pathway genes that impact circadian function. Using the NIH David Pathway Analysis tool, we identified many components of the insulin signaling pathway represented in our screen hits. Genes that impact clock function and genes regulated by the clock are indicated with colored boxes.(B) Effects of siRNAs against genes involved in insulin signaling. The representative results from the secondary screen using individual siRNA are presented. Data represent the mean ± SD (n = 2).(C) Effects of chemical inhibitors against protein kinases involved in insulin signaling. Bioluminescence rhythms of Bmal1-dLuc cells were monitored in the presence of various concentrations of compounds (8 points of 3-fold dilution series; final 3 nM - 7 µM). Period or phase parameter was plotted against final concentrations of the compound. Data represent the mean ± SD (n = 4). The results for SP600215 and PMA are consistent with our previous observations (Hirota et al., 2008).</div></div>
