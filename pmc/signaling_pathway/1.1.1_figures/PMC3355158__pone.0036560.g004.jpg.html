Potential mechanism of photoreceptor death: TLR4 suppresses neuroprotective Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>..  From: Novel Role for the Innate Immune Receptor Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) in the Regulation of the Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> and Photoreceptor Apoptosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The TLR4 activator LPS significantly decreased Wnt signaling in Muller glia-photoreceptor cultures (A) and the Muller glia cell line MIO-M1 (B–C), as measured by luciferase reporter assay. Normalization to cotransfected Renilla was used to account for the effect of LPS reducing cell number (*p&lt;0.01, n = 4). (C) Wnt signaling is suppressed by wild-type TLR4 (white bars) but not dominant-negative (grey bars) (*p&lt;0.05, n = 5). Luciferase activity was normalized to cotransfected Renilla luciferase, and is shown as the ratio of Wnt signaling in Wnt3a-treated cells to control-treated cells. Mean + SD is shown.</div></div>
