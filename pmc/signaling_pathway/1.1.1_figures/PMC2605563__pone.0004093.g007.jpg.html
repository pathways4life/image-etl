Proposed model for the involvement of NF-κB <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in the regulation of cytokine and chemokine in Tat±morphine treated astrocytes..  From: Morphine Exacerbates HIV-1 Tat-Induced Cytokine Production in Astrocytes through Convergent Effects on [Ca2+]i, NF-?B Trafficking and Transcription. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Arrows indicate activation of the signaling pathway; the “┤” signs indicate pathway inhibition. Exposure to Tat alone increases IκB phosphorylation/degradation and NF-κB transcriptional activity, and additionally increases [Ca2+]i in astrocytes [48]. Although morphine treatment alone fails to significantly activate NF-κB in astrocytes, in combination with Tat it can potentiate Tat-induced increases in [Ca2+]i at sites upstream of NF-κB [37]. How [Ca2+]i affects IκB degradation in the present study is uncertain (?), but may involve increased oxidative stress [55], and decreased proteasome activity.</div></div>
