From: Vacuolar Ca2+/H+ Transport Activity Is Required for Systemic Phosphate Homeostasis Involving Shoot-to-Root <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Arabidopsis1[W][OA]. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Working hypothesis of the CAX1/CAX3-mediated Pi signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. When Pi is limited, repression of shoot CAX1 leads to abrogated cellular Ca2+ homeostasis involving altered [Ca2+]cyt and/or misregulated compartmentation of Ca2+, which initiates the activation of a subset of shoot PSR genes. A shoot-born signal (X) is thereby generated and moves toward the root to activate the Pi transporter system, including PHT1;1, at the posttranslational level.</div></div>
