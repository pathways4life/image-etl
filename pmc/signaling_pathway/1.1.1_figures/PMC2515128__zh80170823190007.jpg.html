Platelets were solubilized and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody (p-p38) or anti-p38 polyclonal antibody to indicate loading levels (p38; top panels), and anti–phospho-Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (p-ERK) or corresponding anti-Erk2 antibody to indicate loading levels (ERK; bottom panels). (B) VWF binding to GPIb–IX activates Lyn, which stimulates the PI3K-Akt-NO-cGMP-PKG-MAPK–dependent early GPIb-IX signaling pathway leading to integrin activation and stable platelet adhesion to VWF under shear stress. This signaling pathway together with integrin outside-in signaling causes TXA2 synthesis and granule secretion of agonists, such as ADP, leading to amplification of integrin activation, increased stable platelet adhesion, and platelet aggregation.</div></div>
