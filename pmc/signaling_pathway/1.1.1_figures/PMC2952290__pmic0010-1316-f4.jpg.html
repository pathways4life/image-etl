Zoom-in of the Enrichment Map gene set cluster representing signaling pathways enriched at the early and mid-stages of heart failure. A summary description of the cluster was visualized as a “term cloud” using Wordle (http://www.wordle.net/) derived from the text descriptions of all gene sets. Term size indicates its frequency; thus, large terms best summarize the cluster (i.e. signaling pathways). Specific terms related to the integrin pathway are highlighted within this cluster and in the network.</div></div>
