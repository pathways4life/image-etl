In NAGs, faint staining of these proteins is visible in the cytoplasm of normal zona glomerulosa cells. However, in IHA and APA patients, the staining of these four proteins is stronger. In general, the immunohistochemical staining of the tissue sections indicated that p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-S6 and VEGF were highly expressed in APA and IHA sections compared with NAGs.
