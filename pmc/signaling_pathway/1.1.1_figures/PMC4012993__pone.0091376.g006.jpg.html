Green nodes indicate mRNAs that were decreased in ScapΔ/Δ lungs with respect to control lungs. Wnt pathway genes that were not changed in response to Scap deletion are depicted as empty nodes. (B) Heatmap demonstrates decreased expression of genes encoding a number of key components in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in ScapΔ/Δ vs. control mice, n = 3/group.</div></div>
