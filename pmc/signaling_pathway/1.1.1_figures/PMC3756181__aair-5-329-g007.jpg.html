Upon LPS binding to the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the NF-κB signaling pathway becomes activated, leading to an increase in COX-2 expression, which in turn activates cAMP/PKA/AKAP through the production of PGE2. The PKA-AKAP complex blocks HO-1 activity, which results in enhanced translocation of NF-κB p65 to the nucleus.</div></div>
