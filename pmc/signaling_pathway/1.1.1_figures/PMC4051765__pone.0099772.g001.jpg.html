Down-regulated ones are green (the darker green, the more down-regulation). The unchanged transcripts have no color. The signs between two components represent activation (arrow) and inhibition (bar or bar crossing arrow). Our data show that 4-hours of cold stimulation regulated multiple transcripts of the insulin signaling pathway in BAT of rats.</div></div>
