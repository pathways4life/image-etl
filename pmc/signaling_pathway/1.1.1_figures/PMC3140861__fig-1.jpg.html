Diagramed are the genetic and physical interactions of the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway components discussed in this review and shown to be essential for organ formation and proper function of the primary cilia. Based on the role of Wnt/PCP signaling in zebrafish and other animal models, we surmise that the actin cytoskeleton may be a main target of this pathway during organogenesis. Hair cell polarity within the lateral line neuromasts is dependent on the vangl2. However, loss of glypican 4, wnt5b, or wnt11 does not perturb neuromast organization. In contrast, while glypican 4 and wnt5b mutant embryos exhibit irregular chondrocyte stacking, the organization of vangl2 mutant cartilages appears to be normal. Recently, Wnt/PCP signaling has been shown to interact with the components of the primary cilia. Proteins involved in the Wnt/PCP pathway, such as Dishevelled and Vangl2, can co-localize with the cilia and may regulate its localization and function. Primary cilia may be also involved with the down regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling,67 similar to Wnt/PCP. Overexpression of the Wnt/PCP pathway ligands appears to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling in fin regeneration,42 but the precise mechanisms of this interaction were not explored. The neuromast hair cell schematic was adapted from Lopez-Schier et al.,28,29 and the chondrocyte stacking schematic was adapted from Topczewski et al.13 Dub, Duboraya; Sea, Seahorse; Pk, Prickle; Vangl2, Van Gogh–like 2; Bbs4, Bardet–Biedl syndrome 4; Ofd1, oral-facial-digital syndrome 1.</div></div>
