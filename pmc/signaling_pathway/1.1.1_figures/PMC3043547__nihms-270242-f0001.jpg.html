In this pathway, TNF receptor 1 recruits and activates IKK to form a signaling complex through TNF receptor associated death domain (TRADD), RIP, and TRAF2. IKK then phosphorylates IκB, which leads to IκB ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome. Subsequently, the NF-κB complex (p65/p50) migrates to the nucleus and activates gene transcription. In the non-canonical pathway (represented by CD40L), NIK-mediated IKKα activation triggers the processing of p100 to create p52. Then the NF-κB complex (p52/RelB) moves to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. In the atypical pathway such as that activated by UV, IKK-independent mechanisms are involved in IκB phosphorylation.</div></div>
