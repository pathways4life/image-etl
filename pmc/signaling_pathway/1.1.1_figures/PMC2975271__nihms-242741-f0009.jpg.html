Our model proposes that Plk2 and TSC1 interact to facilitate TSC1/TSC2 restraint of mTOR. Decreased mTOR activity leads to decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K and consequent decrease in protein translation, cell growth and proliferation. These events are regulated by hypoxia and DNA damage.</div></div>
