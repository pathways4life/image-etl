The Akt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> is one of the effector mechanism of EGF/EGFR but warrants consideration as a stand-alone target.  From: Targeting glioma stem cells: a novel framework for brain tumors. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Akt is a serine-threonine kinase that is part of the PI3K signaling pathway. GSC are more dependent on Akt signaling than non-GSC, rendering Akt a potential target preferentially affecting GSC. Upon EGFR activation, PI3K stimulates the production of PIP3 from PIP2, that, in turn, stimulates the phosphorylation of Akt. Akt is a critical regulator of multiple cellular functions, such as proliferation, survival and metabolism. PTEN can directly counteract and reverse the effect of PI3K. Both EGFR and Akt may be inhibited by drugs used in the clinical setting. Erlotinib and gefitinib inhibit EGFR, while perifosine inhibits Akt. Abbreviations: PIP2= phosphatidylinositol-4-5-bisphosphate; PIP3= phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate; p=phosphorylated.</div></div>
