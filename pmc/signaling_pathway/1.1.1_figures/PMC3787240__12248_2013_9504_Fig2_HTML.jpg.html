Sulforaphane (SFN) and I3C/DIM inhibit the Akt signaling axis, a signaling pathway often hyperactive in prostate cancer. Inhibition of this pathway decreases pro-survival signaling by mTOR, Akt, and NFkB. Sulforaphane and I3C/DIM treatment also lead to changes in gene expression (blue arrow) that trigger growth arrest and apoptosis. The expression of proteins controlling the cell cycle (e.g., p21, p27, and CDK6) is altered to effect growth arrest, and apoptosis is finally induced through the mitochondrial pathway. Abbreviations: AR androgen receptor, CDK6 cyclin-dependant kinase 6, IAP inhibitors of apoptosis</div></div>
