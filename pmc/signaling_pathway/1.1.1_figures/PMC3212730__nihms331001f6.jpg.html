Genes affected by loss of TGF-β signaling were identified by genome-wide microarray analysis. Next, the overlap of genes affected by TGF-β signaling and genes bound by each transcription factor (TF) were determined. The p-value was calculated using the hypogeometric distribution.(B) Inhibition of the TGF-β pathway affects genes bound by the mES cell core regulatory transcription factors. Genome-wide expression was performed in mES cells that were cultured under standard conditions or in the presence of SB431542 for 24 hr. The association of genes bound by each transcription factor with genes affected by TGF-β signaling (significance of transcription factor occupancy at genes affected by TGF-β signaling, x-axis) was calculated for genes bound by Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Smad3 and Zfx (y-axis). A factor was considered to bind genes affected by TGF-β signaling at a p value &lt; 1e-5 (gray line).(C) TGF-β signaling leads to recruitment of p300 at genes co-occupied by Oct4 and Smad3. mES cells were treated with SB431542 for 24 hr before being washed and treated with fresh SB431542 or 10 ng/ml Activin for 1 hr. ChIP was performed for p300 and IgG, and qPCR was performed to quantify the fold enrichment of p300 relative to IgG (y-axis) at the indicated genes.(D) TGF-β signaling regulates different genes in different cell types. Genome-wide expression analysis was performed after 24 hr treatment with SB431542 in mES cells and 12 hr after activation of TGF-β signaling in myotubes and pro-B cells. The fold change in expression for each affected gene is indicated by color (bottom) and is shown for mES cells (left), myotubes (center) and pro-B cells (right). All genes that change in only one cell type are shown. Statistical analysis was then performed (as described in A) to determine if there was an association between genes bound by each transcription factor and genes affected by TGF-β signaling for each cell type. Analysis was performed for genes affected by TGF-β signaling in mES cells (top right), myotubes (middle right) and pro-B cells (bottom right). See also Table S4.</div></div>
