Effects of <b>(A)</b> TGF-Î² signaling inhibitor (SB431542, SB), <b>(B)</b> WNT signaling inhibitor [dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), DKK], and <b>(C)</b> BMP signaling inhibitor (Noggin, Ng) on the expression patterns of mesoderm-lineage genes in hESCs. After 3 days of treatment, real-time PCR was used to measure the expression levels of mesoderm-lineage genes (T, MIXL1, and WNT3a) in the chemical-treated hESCs. Untreated hESCs and ABB-treated hESCs were used as the negative control and positive control, respectively. Statistical significance among samples was evaluated by ANOVA (*P&lt;0.05).
