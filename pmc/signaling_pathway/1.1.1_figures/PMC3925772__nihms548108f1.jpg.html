From: Using Optogenetics to Interrogate the Dynamic Control of Signal Transmission by the Ras/Erk Module. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Optogenetic inputs can be used to stimulate a single intracellular node to isolate subnetworks within the full physiological signaling response network.(B) By applying time-varying light inputs, it is possible to dissect how dynamics are transmitted and drive specific responses.(C) These approaches can be used to understand how a shared signaling node can yield distinct responses when reused in multiple physiological pathways. Specificity can be encoded by distinct combinations of activated pathways (left panel) or by the dynamics of activation (e.g., duration or amplitude) of a single pathway (right panel).(D) Direct optogenetic activation of shared nodes provides a powerful approach to dissect these mechanisms of encoding.</div></div>
