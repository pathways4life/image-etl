Release of CK2 from different CK2-BMPRIa interaction sited regulates differentiation into osteoblasts (release from CK2.2, aa 324–328) via activation of Smad4 and mTor signaling pathways or via ERK/MEK signaling pathway (release from CK2.3, aa 213–217), and adipocytes (release from CK2.2, aa 324–328) by activation of Smad4, p38, and MEK signaling pathways</div></div>
