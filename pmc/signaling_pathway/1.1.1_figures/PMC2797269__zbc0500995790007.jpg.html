From: Oxidative Stress Inhibits Insulin-like Growth Factor-I Induction of Chondrocyte Proteoglycan Synthesis through Differential Regulation of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase-Akt and MEK-ERK MAPK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Hypothetical model for the effect of oxidative stress on IGF-I regulation of chondrocyte proteoglycan (aggrecan) and collagen II production.</b> In this model, the balance of Akt and ERK1/2 activation determines the final effect of IGF-I on proteoglycan production and collagen expression. In normal chondrocytes, IGF-I activates the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), which induces IRS-1 activation through tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequently activates the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway, which leads downstream to increased aggrecan synthesis and collagen II expression. Increased activation of MEK-ERK signaling, stimulated by oxidative stress and increased ROS levels present in OA cartilage, inhibits aggrecan and collagen gene transcription. Oxidative stress also activates MEK-ERK signaling, which, through inducing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, negatively regulates IGF-I activation of PI 3-kinase-Akt signaling and proteoglycan synthesis.</div></div>
