B) HEK293A cells were infected with the 7xTcf-FFluc//SV40-mCherry (“7TFC”) virus and responded similarly to purified Wnt3A protein (left). Cells expressed mCherry in a constitutive manner (right). C) HEK293A cells were infected with the 7xTcf-FFluc//SV40-PuroR (“7TFP”) virus and also responded to purified Wnt3A protein in a dose-dependent manner (left). Selection of 7TFP-infected HEK293T cells with puromycin (1 µg/ml) allowed for enrichment of Wnt-responding cells, resulting in increased luciferase signal upon addition of conditioned medium (right, compare “Puro” with “−”). D) Adipose-derived mesenchymal cells (“ADMCs”) were infected with the 7xTcf-PuroR (7TP) lentivirus. Addition of purified Wnt3A protein (500 ng/ml final, “Wnt3A”) allowed selection of Wnt-responding cells with puromycin (1 µg/ml), while cells incubated in absence of Wnt3A (“vhc”) were all killed by the drug treatment. For all graphs, activity is relative to vehicle- or mock-treated cells.</div></div>
