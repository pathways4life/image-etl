There are three key signaling pathways in GBM. The RTK/RAS/PI(3)K pathway is involved in cell growth, apoptosis resistance, invasion, and migration (pictured above with targeted therapies). The other critically important pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival are p53 and RB signaling (5) [adapted from Ref. (14)].</div></div>
