Full activation of PLCγ by Btk results in IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER, resulting in activation of the Cn–NFAT signaling pathway. PKCβ activation by Ca2+ and DAG leads to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and the induction of myc expression. Our results implicate Myc in amplifying [Ca2+]i by decreasing PMCA4-mediated Ca2+ efflux, thereby promoting optimal NFAT-dependent proliferation, differentiation, and immunogenic B cell responses. Induction of low level Ca2+ signals or Myc signaling alone results in a tolerogenic and/or apoptotic response, whereas Myc activation together with sustained Ca2+/NFAT signals or constitutive Myc signaling alone promotes B cell activation/differentiation or tumorigenesis.</div></div>
