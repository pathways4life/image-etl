The reactions in the pathway resource were used to obtain a descriptive network of reactions using CellDesigner. The legend for the pathway map is provided in the box to the right. The reactions are broadly arranged according to the cellular component they occur in and are depicted here on the plasma membrane (yellow thick line at the top) and the nucleus (the rectangle with the blue border at the bottom) and the cytosol (the space between the yellow line and the blue rectangle). The small molecules such as cyclic AMP (cAMP), calcium (Ca++), inositol 3-phosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) which are important mediators of FSH signaling are also represented in the map.</div></div>
