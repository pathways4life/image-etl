We propose that Wnt signaling acts to maintain lin-39 expression in all VPCs to prevent them from adopting the Fused fate. PRY-1 Axin and APR-1 APC act negatively to regulate the Wnt pathway, and BAR-1 β-catenin and POP-1 TCF act positively. In a cell in which the Ras pathway is inactive like P4.p, LIN-39 is required to adopt the 3° uninduced cell fate. In a cell in which the Ras pathway is active such as P6.p, we propose that the activity of both pathways leads to higher levels of LIN-39 expression, as has been reported by Maloof and Kenyon (1998). We propose that this higher level of LIN-39 and/or other Wnt pathway targets is instructive in causing the VPC to adopt an induced cell fate. In a cell in which the Wnt pathway has been hyperactivated (e.g., pry-1 loss-of-function), higher levels of LIN-39 and/or other Wnt targets allows adoption of an induced cell fate in the absence of input from the Ras pathway.</div></div>
