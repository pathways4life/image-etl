Both LMP1 and LMP2a activate members of the SFK (Fyn and Lyn, respectively) upstream of Syk activation. Syk then activates the PI3K/Akt/mTor signaling pathway. Small molecule inhibitors of these signaling molecules that are currently in preclinical or clinical development in other malignancies are listed next to their described target.</div></div>
