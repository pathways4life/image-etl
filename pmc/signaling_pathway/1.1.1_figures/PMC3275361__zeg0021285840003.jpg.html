In the osteocyte (and late osteoblasts), activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway occurs upon simultaneous binding of the secreted glycoprotein Wnt3a (or other Wnts like Wnt 10b for instance) to the seven-helix-receptor frizzled (Fz) family and the coreceptors Lrp 5/6. Binding of Wnt3a to Lrp5/6 changes the conformation of the cytoplasmic receptor domain, causing the recruitment of Axin2 and preventing the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β and its proteasomal degradation. β-Catenin accumulates in the cytosol and translocates into the nucleus, thereby stimulating the expression of the Lrp5/6 antagonists Dkk1 and sclerostin, and the RANKL inhibitor OPG, via the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (Tcf/Lef). PTH binds to its seven-transmembrane-spanning receptor and activates phosphatidyl inositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC), cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and the protein kinase C (PKC) downstream signaling cascades, all contributing to the bone anabolic effect of PTH. In addition, PTH signaling cross talks with the Wnt signaling pathway by associating with Lrp6, inhibiting GSK3β, stabilizing β-catenin, and inhibiting the expression of both sclerostin and Dkk1.</div></div>
