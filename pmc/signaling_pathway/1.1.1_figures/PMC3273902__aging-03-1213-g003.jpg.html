KGN cells (wild–type, ΔLamin ΔGSTT1 or Δp38α cells) were treated with or without H2O2 at 200 μM for 24 h before investigation of the expression of GSTT1 and activation of p38 and MK2 by immunofluorescence analysis (<b>A</b>). The primary antibodies against GSTT1, phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated MK2 were probed with anti-rabbit IgG–Alexa488 (Green). Cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 at 10 μM (Blue). Magnification: ×200. Bar graphs represent the mean fluorescence intensity per cell ± SEM (<b>B</b>). One–way ANOVA: (<b>B</b>, GSTT1) P &lt; 0.001, (<b>B</b>, p-p38) P &lt; 0.05, (<b>B</b>, p-MK2) P &lt; 0.001.</div></div>
