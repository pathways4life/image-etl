Mechanical stretch-induced cytokine production and EMT were attenuated with lum−/− mice and pharmacologic inhibition of ERK1/2 activity by PD98059. EMT = epithelial-mesenchymal transition; VILI = ventilator-induced lung injury. See Figure 1 and 6 legends for expansion of other abbreviations.</div></div>
