(<b>a</b>) Fractional dose response is shown with respect to Kss1p of MAPK pathway, with cross-activation of MAPK pathway by Tpks of cAMP pathway included. Curve ‘a’ shows the case without cross-activation. The strength of cross activation was varied by varing the ‘Km’ value of Tpks for the transcriptional activator Ste12Tec1 complex, b (1500 nM), c (600 nM), d (450 nM), e (375 nM), f (330 nM) and g (300 nM). (<b>b</b>) FLO11 expression with respect to upstream activator Ras2GTP. Curve ‘a’ represents the case without cross-activation of MAPK pathway, whereas curve ‘b’ represents the case with cross-activation (Km = 450 nM). The requirement of Ras2GTP decreases with cross-activation. (<b>c</b>) Fractional dose response with respect to upstream activator of cAMP pathway (Gpa2p) and MAPK pathway (Ras2GTP), when the fractional activation of either pathway was fixed at 20% while the other was varied in presence of cross-activation. Curve ‘a’ represents dose response when fractional activation of cAMP pathway was restricted to 20%. Curve ‘b’ represents dose response when fractional activation of MAPK pathway was restricted to 20%</div></div>
