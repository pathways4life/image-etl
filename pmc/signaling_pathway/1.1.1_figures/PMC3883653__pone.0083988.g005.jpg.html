From: Mice Fed Rapamycin Have an Increase in Lifespan Associated with Major Changes in the Liver Transcriptome. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Pathway analysis was conducted using IPA for significantly changed transcripts in Rapa-2 males and Rapa females relative to respective sex controls with adjusted p&lt;0.05 and 15% change. IPA used Fisher's exact test to place genes into pathways, and we also used a FDR cutoff of B-H p&lt;0.05 to show the highly significant pathways. The 13 shared pathways ranked by B-H p-value are shown for Rapa-2 males (<b>A</b>) and Rapa females (<b>B</b>). For the graphical portion of A and B, the yellow line indicates the â€“log(B-H p-value). Red indicates up-regulated and green represents down-regulated genes significantly changed in Rapa compared to control, and white indicates the percentage of genes not significantly changed in the pathway relative to the total number of genes in that pathway (bolded number). Twenty-four other pathways were observed to change significantly in Rapa-2 males: acute phase response signaling, hypoxia signaling, PI3K/AKT signaling, remodeling of epithelial adherens junctions, sertoli cell-sertoli cell junction signaling, renal cell carcinoma signaling, JAK/Stat signaling, IL-3 signaling, myc mediated apoptosis Signaling, germ cell-sertoli cell junction signaling, pancreatic adenocarcinoma signaling, insulin receptor signaling, non-small cell lung cancer signaling, Rac signaling, small cell lung cancer signaling, PTEN signaling, prostate cancer signaling, neurotrophin/TRK signaling, PAK signaling, RAR activation, NGF signaling, clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling, huntington's disease signaling, and TCA cycle II. Six other pathways were observed to change significantly in Rapa females: systemic lupus erythematosus signaling, mTOR signaling, actin nucleation by ARP-WASP complex, superpathway of methionine degradation, glutathione-mediated detoxification, and oncostatin M signaling. A list of the pathways that significantly changed with chronic Rapa feeding is shown in in File S2, tab2 for Rapa-2 male; tab3 for Rapa female and the transcripts that change for the 13 shared pathways are found in File S3. The asterisk indicates that the mitochondrial function pathway is indicated as mitochondrial dysfunction in IPA. The mitochondrial dysfunction pathway described in IPA is somewhat misleading because it contains genes involved in mitochondrial function in general, e.g., genes in the electron transport chain complexes and redox and antioxidant enzymes as well as other genes related to mitochondrial function.</div></div>
