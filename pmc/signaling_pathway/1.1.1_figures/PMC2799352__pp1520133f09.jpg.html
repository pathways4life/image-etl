In the absence of ABA, PYR-PYL/RCAR proteins may interact with PP2Cs, but these PP2Cs remain active. Upon ABA perception, PYR-PYL/RCAR proteins interact with PP2Cs, maintaining these PP2Cs as inactive and subsequently activating the transcription of ABA-responsive genes (including PP2Cs). The specific colocalization of FsPP2C1-PYL8/RCAR3 in the nucleus is shown.</div></div>
