From: Viperin: a multifunctional, interferon-inducible protein that regulates virus replication. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Regulation of viperin expression. Viperin induction is mediated by both the classical IFN-stimulated gene induction pathway and the IFN-independent pathway. The IFN-mediated viperin gene expression is regulated by ISGF3 (left panel), while IFN-independent viperin gene expression is regulated by IRF1 and IRF3, which can be activated by viral factors or by the peroxisomal MAVS signaling pathway.</div></div>
