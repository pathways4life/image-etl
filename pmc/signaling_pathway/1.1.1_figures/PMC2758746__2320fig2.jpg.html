(A) Hxt3-GFP signal in [gar−] and [GAR+] cells (S288c background) by fluorescence microscopy. (B) Frequency of [GAR+] in knockouts of members of the Snf3/Rgt2 glucose signaling pathway. Δsnf3 is completely resistant to glucosamine, and therefore [GAR+] frequency could not be measured. Furthermore, the frequency of spontaneous glucosamine-resistant colonies in the Δrgt1, Δstd1, and Δmths1 strains was close to the rate of genetic mutation, and therefore these colonies might not carry the actual [GAR+] element. Overall, this pathway is enriched for genes that alter [GAR+] frequency when knocked out relative to the library of nonessential genes (P = 8 × 10−6, Fisher's exact test).

(D) Measurement of [GAR+] frequency following overexpression of Snf3/Rgt2 pathway members. Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation (n = 6). STD1 strongly induces conversion to [GAR+] and MTH1 blocks it. (E, top) Tetrad spores from a [GAR+] diploid with the genotype std1∷kanMX/STD1. (Bottom) Spores from top crossed to a [gar−] strain with a wild-type STD1 allele.</div></div>
