From: Centrosomal kinase Nek2 cooperates with oncogenic pathways to promote metastasis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(<b>a</b>) Analysis of Oncomine data showed that median hNek2 mRNA levels were consistently upregulated in patient tumors in the following cancers—breast,41 pancreas,42 colorectal,43 lymphoma,44 esophagus,45 liver,46 bladder,47 lung,48 and cervical.49 (<b>b</b>) The chemical structure of Nek2 pharmacophore identified for possible SAR studies. (<b>c</b>) Model showing how Nek2 signaling can promote metastasis by cooperating with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and RTK signaling; chromosomal instability (CIN). The PI3K-Akt pathway is an axis through which Nek2 cooperates with other pathways, indicated by heavy black arrow. Akt pathway upregulation would inhibit GSK3β leading to stabilization of β-catenin and increase in Wnt signaling. Wingless/Wnt itself is also upregulated by Nek2 expression, creating the possibility of a complex feedback loop through interaction with other signaling pathways such as the Hippo cascade.50 Red inhibitory signs indicate points along the signaling cascade where we can pharmacologically inhibit Nek2-driven tumorigenesis more effectively.</div></div>
