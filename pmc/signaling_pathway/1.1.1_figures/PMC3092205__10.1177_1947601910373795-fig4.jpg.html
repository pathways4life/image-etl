From: The Role of B-RAF Mutations in Melanoma and the Induction of EMT via Dysregulation of the NF-?B/Snail/RKIP/PTEN Circuit. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Activation of NF-κB by the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. (<b>A</b>) Activation of NF-κB via the PI3K/AKT pathway. Activation of the PI3K pathway by RAS results in the production of AKT. AKT activates NF-κB through the activation of IKK. Activation of NF-κB results in Snail-induced EMT. PI3K signaling is antagonized by PTEN; however, up-regulation in Snail inhibits PTEN, resulting in a self-amplification cycle. (<b>B</b>) Activation of NF-κB via the MAPK pathway NF-κB is regulated through MEK-induced activation of IKK and ERK-induced up-regulation of Snail. (<b>C</b>) Regulation of Snail via RKIP and PTEN up-regulation of Snail through the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways inhibits both PTEN and RKIP, which then, in turn, amplifies the expression of Snail.</div></div>
