Binding of insulin to its receptor on adipocytes triggers the phosphorylation and activation of insulin receptor substrate, which forms a docking site for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) at the membrane. When docked, PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, a second messenger that activates phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 and recruits Akt (also known as protein kinase B, PKB) to the cell membrane. Consequently, PI3K-AKT/PKB signaling pathway regulates metabolic processes. The red arrows indicate up-regulation (when pointing upward) or down-regulation (when pointing downward) in response to PI3K-AKT/PKB signaling pathway. The Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway leads to the activation of genes which are involved in cell growth, thereby promoting inflammation and atherogenesis. IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PKB, protein kinase B.</div></div>
