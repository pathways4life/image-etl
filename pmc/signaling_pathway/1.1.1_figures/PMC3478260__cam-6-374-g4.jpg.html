Schematic illustration of distinct signaling pathways triggered by L1CAM due to the interacting with different binding partners. (A) L1CAM homophilic interactions promote static cell-cell binding and trigger predominantly the MAPK pathway. This signaling can be modulated by interactions with growth factor receptors (GFR). (B) The binding of L1CAM to integrins triggers NFκB activation and renders cells more motile and invasive. Cleavage of L1CAM from the membrane generates soluble L1CAM. The intracellular fragment L1-ICD can translocate into the nucleus and activate gene transcription. (C) Upregulation of L1CAM by TGF-β allows L1CAM-integrin downstream signaling via FAK-Src. This pathway induces production and release of IL-1β that in turn activates NFκB via binding to the IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI).</div></div>
