CaM complex activates phosphatase 2B (PP2B), which promotes insertion of Ntcp by dephosphorylation. This pathway is counter-regulated by cPKC. cAMP also stimulates Ntcp targeting by PI3K-dependent activation of PDK1 and subsequent PKB activation. Alternatively, PKB is activated by the concerted action of the atypical PKCζ and PDK2. Finally, cAMP/PI3K signaling stimulatory pathway may involve PKCδ.</div></div>
