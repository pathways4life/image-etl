Models for control of hepcidin expression by iron..  From: Iron regulation by hepcidin. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Efficient hepcidin expression in hepatocytes requires an intact BMP signaling pathway, HJV, neogenin, TfR2, HFE, and BMP6. (<b>A</b>) Under high iron conditions, increased loading of Tf with iron stabilizes TfR2, disrupts the HFE-TfR1 interaction, and induces BMP6 secretion from the nonparenchymal cells of the liver, which facilitates the formation of a complex consisting of the BMP receptor/BMP6/HJV/neogenin/TfR2/HFE to induce hepcidin expression. (<b>B</b>) Low iron conditions increase MT2, which induces the cleavage of hepatic HJV. Decreased Tf saturation in the circulation destabilizes TfR2 protein and facilitates the HFE-TfR1 interaction. Low iron levels in the liver reduce BMP6 secretion from the nonparenchymal cells, consequently blunting BMP signaling and lowering hepcidin expression. (<b>C</b>) Inflammation induces the expression of IL-6 and activin B in the liver, which activates the transcription of hepcidin via the STAT3/JAK2 pathway and the BMP signaling pathway, respectively. </div></div>
