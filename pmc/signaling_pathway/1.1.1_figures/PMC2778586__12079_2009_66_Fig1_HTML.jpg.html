Decorin binds and induces phosphorylation of the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor, causing downstream activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and the Akt/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB) pathway. In endothelial and renal tubular epithelial cells this signaling cascade leads to an inhibition of apoptosis, whereas in renal fibroblasts signaling through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70S6 Kinase (p70S6K) leads to increased translation and synthesis of fibrillin-1. These pathways demonstrate the intricate regulatory mechanisms whereby decorin modulates IGF-IR signaling in a cell type-specific manner, thereby giving rise to different biological outcomes</div></div>
