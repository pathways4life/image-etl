Equal protein loading was verified by stripping the blots and reprobing with tubulin antibody. Band density of each protein was normalized with tubulin and expressed as % increase or decrease ± SE as compared to controls. <b>C-D:</b> Expression levels of E-cadherin (red) and vimentin (green) was examined in CAL-IL-6 cells (C) or IOE-IL-6 cells (D) by fluorescent microscope (600×).</div></div>
