From: CD147 induces UPR to inhibit apoptosis and chemosensitivity by increasing the transcription of Bip in hepatocellular carcinoma. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"> Putative mechanisms responsible for UPR activation by CD147 in human HCC cells. CD147 is induced during ERS in human HCC cells. By interacting with integrin α3β1, CD147 activates the FAK–Src signaling pathway, which promotes p-TFII-I nuclear translocation and the subsequent transcription of Bip via binding to the ERSE sites. By inhibiting ERS-induced cell apoptosis and decreasing chemosensitivity, this CD147-mediated signaling pathway may contribute to cell survival after ERS in human HCC cells</div></div>
