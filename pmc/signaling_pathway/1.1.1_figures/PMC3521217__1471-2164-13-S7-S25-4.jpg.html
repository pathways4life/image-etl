The pathways are integrated and visualized via the Pathway Integration Tool (PINT) [36]. The oval nodes denote the proteins, and the octagon nodes denote the protein complexes. The edges between nodes represent the interactions or reactions. The green and blue nodes correspond to the components in S1P4 and ROHA signaling pathways, respectively. The yellow node is the common component between pathways.</div></div>
