From: The GTPase-activating protein Rap1GAP: A new player to modulate Ret <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model describing the proposed role of Rap1GAP in the control of GDNF-induced Ret signaling. After activation of Ret by the heterocomplex GDNF/GFRÎ±1, Ret becomes phosphorylated at different tyrosine sites. In particular, the Tyr1062 has been described to mediate the activation of Dok-4, which then triggers a sustained activation of Rap1-ERK1/2 pathway and neurite outgrowth. At the same time, Ret activation results in phosphorylation of the Tyr981 (Y981), which is the docking site involved in the recruitment of the negative signaling regulator Rap1GAP. Thus, Rap1GAP counterbalances the Dok-4/Rap1/ERK1/2 pathway and controls neurite outgrowth. The figure also shows a possible role of PKA in the inhibition of Rap1GAP activity (dashed line), and indicates the potential involvement of Rap1 in the modulation of neurite outgrowth through the concomitant activation of Vav2 and/or Tiam1, two GEFs for Rac1 and Cdc-42 (dashed arrow).</div></div>
