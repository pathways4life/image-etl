From: Ras and Rac1, Frequently Mutated in Melanomas, Are Activated by Superoxide Anion, Modulate Dnmt1 Level and Are Causally Related to Melanocyte Malignant Transformation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Ras/Rac1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway seems to be regulated by and regulates superoxide anion production during melan-a anchorage blockade and its activation could be responsible for the high Dnmt1 protein level and changes in global DNA methylation during the loss of cell adhesion. Anchorage blockade might promote an epigenetic reprogramming in order to adapt the cells to the new microenvironmental condition and contribute to the acquisition of a malignant phenotype.</div></div>
