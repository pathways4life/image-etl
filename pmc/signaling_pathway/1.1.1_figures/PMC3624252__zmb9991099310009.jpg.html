From: Gab2 Phosphorylation by RSK Inhibits Shp2 Recruitment and Cell Motility. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic representation of Gab2 signaling and its negative regulation by RSK. While Gab2 phosphorylation at tyrosine residues promotes Shp2 recruitment and activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, RSK-mediated phosphorylation of Gab2 on Ser/Thr residues inhibits Shp2 binding and Shp2-dependent signaling. RSK-mediated phosphorylation of Gab2 likely plays a role in tightly regulating Gab2-dependent biological functions, such as the regulation of cell motility.</div></div>
