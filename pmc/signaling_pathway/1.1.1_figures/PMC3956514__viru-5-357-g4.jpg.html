Stress responses mediated by UPR and MAPK signaling cascades are coordinated to buffer cells against the toxicity of camalexin. Parallel studies with A. brassicicola knockout mutants showed that camalexin induced AbHog1-dependent phosphorylation of AbSlt2 MAP kinase. 43  The UPR signaling pathway is independently activated by production of spliced AbHacA mRNA (AbHacAi). 8  This compensatory response may lead to cell wall strengthening and membrane remodeling.</div></div>
