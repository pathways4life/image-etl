B, signaling in response to GLP-1 agonists such  as Exd4. The thicker arrow indicates a major pathway of GLP-1/GLP-1R  to cAMP/PKA phosphorylating Ser-675 on β-catenin and thereby stabilizing  against degradation. The thin arrows with Xs indicate that  the pathway designated by the arrow is not involved in  GLP-1-activated Wnt signaling at the level of activating gene transcription  via β-catenin/TCF7L2. The cross-bar indicates the inhibition of  GSK3 activity by Gao and disheveled (DVL), an upstream pathway of  canonical Wnt signaling.</div></div>
