Dueber et al [49,51] showed that the allosterically regulation of the signaling protein N-WASP could be reprogrammed by recombining the catalytic domain from N-WASP with different combinations of interaction domains. Novel behaviors included multi-input (AND-gate) control and highly cooperative switch-like activation.<b>b | using scaffold proteins as a molecular circuitboard for reshaping signaling output</b>. The input/output linkage of a MAP kinase pathway in yeast could be redirected via an engineered chimeric scaffold that assembled a novel combination of kinases [58]. Novel interaction sites can also be appended on to scaffolds to recruit additional modulatory factors. These additional factors can be build synthetic feedback loops that can be used to generate pathways that display diverse signaling dynamics [62].</div></div>
