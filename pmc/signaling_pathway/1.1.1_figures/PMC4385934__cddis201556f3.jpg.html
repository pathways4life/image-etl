(<b>a</b>) Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression of the indicated elements of the Cripto-Nodal signaling pathway in Kit+ and Kit- spermatogonia. (<b>b</b>) Western blot analysis of Smad2 phosphorylation in cultured untreated Kit+ spermatogonia and in the same cells treated overnight with recombinant Nodal, in the presence or absence of the Alk4/7 selective inhibitor SB431542. Densitometric analysis of western blots from three independent experiments is shown below. Bars represent the mean Â±S.D.</div></div>
