(<b>A</b>) Downregulation of signaling mediated by inhibitory RKIP actions. (<b>B</b>) Activation of signaling elicited by removal of RKIP. Left: the ERK MAPK pathway. RKIP binds to activated RAF1 and inhibits its interaction with MEK, thus antagonizing MEK phosphorylation and activation. Phosphorylation of RKIP by protein kinase C (PKC) releases RKIP from RAF1. Center: the NF-κB pathway. RKIP interacts with the activating kinases of the NF-κB pathway: transforming growth factor β-activated kinase (TAK), IκB kinase-α (IKK-α), IκB kinase-β (IKK-β), and NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). Release of RKIP from TAK, IKKs, and NIK (by an unknown mechanism) results in the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB, which in turn releases NF-κB. Right: G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways. GPCR kinase-2 (GRK2) antagonizes the activity of GPCRs. Phosphorylation of RKIP by PKC activates it for binding to GRK2, resulting in the inhibition of GRK2 activity. This allows GPCRs to interact with their cognate G-proteins (G), thus promoting GPCR-mediated signaling.</div></div>
