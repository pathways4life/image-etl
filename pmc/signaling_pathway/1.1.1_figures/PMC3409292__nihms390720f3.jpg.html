From: Genetic and Cellular Mechanisms Regulating Anterior Foregut and Esophageal Development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Conversion of simple columnar to stratified squamous epithelium in the esophagus involving dynamic Bmp signaling activities. (A) Immunostained cross sections of E11.0 and E12.5 trachea and esophagus. Krt8 is expressed in the epithelium of both the esophagus and trachea after their formation from the foregut. Sox2 remains highly expressed in the epithelium of the dorsal, foregut-derived esophagus at E11.0 and E12.5. Note the conversion from single to multi-layered epithelium in the esophagus from E11.0 to E12.5, shown by co-immunostaining with p63 and Sox2 antibodies. (B) Schematic of the stratification and differentiation of esophageal epithelium through a two-stage Bmp signaling pattern. Stratification of the epithelium from E11.0 to E14.5 correlates with Noggin-mediated suppression of Bmp signaling. Ectopic Bmp activity in Noggin null and Shh-Cre; Rosa26caBmpr1a mutants inhibits the stratification process. Differentiation of the top layers of epithelium at E14.5-P9.0 requires activation of the Bmp signaling pathway while basal progenitor cells remain negative for Bmp signaling. Deletion of Bmpr1a in Shh-Cre; Bmpr1aloxp/loxp mutants inhibits the differentiation of suprabasal cells. Scale bar: 50Î¼m. eso, esophagus; tra, trachea.</div></div>
