From: Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation during lens development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">FGF binding to the outside of FGFR induces FGFR dimerization, receptor autophosphorylation followed by phosphorylation of the lipid-anchored docking protein Frs2α. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Frs2α serves as a focal protein for a multiprotein complex assembly that signals via two branches of FGF signaling, PI3K/Akt and FGF/MAPK. Additional components of this pathway such as heparin, N-cadherin, MKP3 and Sprouty (not shown) are discussed in text.</div></div>
