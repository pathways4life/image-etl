JNK and IKKβ are activated downstream of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLRs or by ER stress. IKKβ is also involved in the activation of the Tpl2/ERK pathway. These pathways participate in the production of inflammatory cytokines via the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB. Many of the produced inflammatory cytokines are able to activate these kinases leading to a feed-forward amplification loop. JNK and ERK1/2 are involved in the desensitization of insulin signaling through phosphorylation of IRS1/2 on inhibitory serine sites (SerP). IKKβ can directly phosphorylate IRS1/2 on serine sites but can also act indirectly through activation of mTORC1/S6 kinase. Over-activation of the mTORC1/S6K pathway could promote ER stress leading to an amplification loop.</div></div>
