TGF-α was mainly expressed in MEEC whereas TGF-β1 was not. Unlike TGF-β1, the expression of TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 was mainly in dMEEC. The TGF-β1 gene expression was down-regulated by Pn6A at the early stage (day 3~7) compared with their controls. The TGF-β2 gene was not responsive to bacterial OM and ETO. The TGF-β3 gene expression was slightly responsive to Pn6A, NTHi, and ETO. Pn6A-3D, day 3 following pneumococcal infection in the middle ear cavity. The genes in the TGF-β signaling pathway, regulated by bacterial OM and ETO, are presented in heat map (B). Note that many genes in the TGF-β signaling pathway are up-regulated in bacterial OM, especially NTHi day 7, but only few genes are slightly up-regulated in ETO.</div></div>
