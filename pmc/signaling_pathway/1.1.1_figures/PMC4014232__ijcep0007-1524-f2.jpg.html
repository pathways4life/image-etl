A: The most significant canonical pathways in which the differentially expressed genes were enriched. The 348 differentially expressed genes (expression difference &gt;4-fold) were applied to Ingenuity Pathway analysis (IPA) software, and the most significant canonical pathways were shown. B: GÎ±i signaling pathway was predicted to be activated in multidrug-resistant Eca-1 cells.</div></div>
