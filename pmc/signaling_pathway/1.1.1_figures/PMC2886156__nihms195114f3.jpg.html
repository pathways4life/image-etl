This revealed near global down-regulation (green) of nearly all members of the canonical signaling pathway. However, several genes, associated with the non-canonical Wnt pathway, were upregulated (pink) including; WNT5A and FZD5. Decreased activity of the canonical Wnt-pathway was confirmed by QRT-PCR for AXIN2, a marker of canonical Wnt signaling (B). Bars indicate mean Â± S.D, * p &lt; 0.05.
