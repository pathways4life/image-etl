Clusters of proteins enriched for the indicated KEGG signaling pathways are shown. Numbered proteins identify Sks1p and a subset of proteins exhibiting Sks1p-dependent phosphorylation by mass spectrometry (shaded red) within the context of the larger connected network. As indicated, the KEGG glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway was enriched in the subset of Sks1p-dependent phosphoproteins identified by mass spectrometry. Proteins within the network clustered around B) the KEGG glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway and C) the KEGG cell cycle and meiosis pathways are highlighted.</div></div>
