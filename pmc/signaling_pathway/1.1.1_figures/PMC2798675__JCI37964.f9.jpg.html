Non–target-directed random siRNA served as a control. (<b>B</b>) Tsc2–/– MEFs were transfected with siRNA to knock down rictor expression for 48 hours and then subjected to immunoblotting for p-STAT3, p63, and Notch components. Non–target-directed random siRNA served as a control. (<b>C</b>) Schematic illustration of how the RTK/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulates cell differentiation through the STAT/p63/Jag/Notch cascade. Upon stimulation of RTKs, PI3K activates AKT, which phosphorylates TSC2 and reduces the GAP activity of the TSC1/TSC2 complex toward Rheb-GTP, increasing Rheb-GTP levels. Rheb-GTP activates mTORC1, which in turn enhances Notch signaling through upregulation of the STAT3/p63 axis. mTORC1 regulates cell differentiation through Notch signaling in a dose-dependent manner.    </div></div>
