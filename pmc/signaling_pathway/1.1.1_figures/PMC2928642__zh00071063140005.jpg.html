Cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% serum without leucine for 2 h. Leucine, LPA, PD-98059, and/or U-0126 was added to the medium, and S6K1 phosphorylation on Thr389 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation on Thr202/Tyr204 were assessed as described in Fig. 3 and 4 legends, respectively. A and B: means ± SE of 5 experiments. In each experiment, 2 samples per condition were independently analyzed. C and D: means ± SE of 3 experiments. In each experiment, 3 samples per condition were independently analyzed. Representative blots are shown. *P &lt; 0.02 vs. cells treated in medium containing 0.5% serum without leucine. †P &lt; 0.011 vs. cells treated with LPA alone.</div></div>
