Activity of TOR is influenced by abundance of growth factors and nutrients as well as by the cellular energy level. Growth factors act through the PI3K pathway which finally leads to inactivation of the TOR inhibitory complex TSC1/TSC2. The cellular energy status is mostly represented by the abundance of amino acids which lead to the activation of AMPK kinase and to subsequent inactivation of TSC1/TSC2. How nutrient perception and intracellular signaling works in detail still remains to be elucidated. Gene identifiers represent possible Arabidopsis LST8 homologs.</div></div>
