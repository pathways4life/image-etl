A, Dendrogram showing the gating hierarchy for the total 12 cell populations including the 7 distinct immune cell subpopulations outlined in red. B, Signaling responses in all 12 of the cell populations. Signaling nodes with fold values &lt;0.25 are represented by gray squares (Response), and signaling nodes with values below this threshold are indicated with white squares (No response). C, Representative histograms from one donor with unmodulated p-Erk levels shown in red and R848-induced p-Erk levels shown in blue. D, Representative histograms from one donor with unmodulated p-Stat1 levels shown in red and IFN-α–induced p-Stat1 levels shown in blue.</div></div>
