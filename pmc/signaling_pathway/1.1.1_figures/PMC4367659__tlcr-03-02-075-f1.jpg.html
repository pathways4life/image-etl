From: Hippo/YAP <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> for targeted therapy. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In normal tissue repair NF2 activates the Hippo pathway, an essential regulator of cell proliferation. Key components of the Hippo pathway include two kinases: Mst and Lats. The sequential activation of these kinases leads to phosphorylation of the transcription factor YAP. When Hippo signaling is attenuated, e.g., in NF2-deficient cancer cells, YAP phosphorylation is reduced, resulting in its nuclear localization and regulation of target genes such as CTGF, Cyr61, AXL and survivin. Survivin is also controlled by nuclear NF2.</div></div>
