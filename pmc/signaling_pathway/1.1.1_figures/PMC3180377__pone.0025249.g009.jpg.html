From: A Toll-Like Receptor 2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Regulates the Ppargc1a/b Metabolic Co-Activators in Mice with Staphylococcal aureus Sepsis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Pathway 1 shows the canonical TLR2 MyD88-dependent signaling pathway that activates NF-kB after S. aureus. Pathway 2 shows TLR4 MyD88-dependent signaling to NF-kB and MyD88â€“independent signaling to TRIF/TRAM. Both MyD88 pathways have been excluded as causes of the Ppargc1a gene expression. Pathway 3 shows a putative TLR2-TLR4 heterodimer interacting with TRIF/TRAM. Pathway 4 indicates TLR2 in the TLR4 null state, as a homodimer or a heterodimer involving a non-TLR4 partner such as TLR1 or 6, interacting with TRIF/TRAM and unmasking the innate immune regulation of Ppargc1a expression. Pathway 5 shows canonical TLR3 endosome signaling also excluded in Ppargc1 gene regulation after S. aureus; however, independent TLR3 activation partially rescues the Ppargc1 phenotype in mice. TIRAP is Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter protein (MAL); IRAK4 is Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4; TRAF3 and TRAF6 are TNF receptor-associated factor 3 and 6; TAK1 is TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 and TBK1 is NF-kappa-B-activating kinase.</div></div>
