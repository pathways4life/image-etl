B, EGF (50 ng/ml) activates ERK1/2 signaling in ARCaPE cells. C, blockade of ERK1/2 signaling with PD98059 or U0126 inhibits EGF-induced EPLIN phosphorylation in ARCaPE cells. Input: total cell lysates. D, blockade of ERK1/2 signaling inhibits EGF-induced EPLIN degradation in ARCaPE cells. E, blockade of ERK1/2 signaling with U0126 inhibits EGF-induced EPLIN degradation in C4-2 cells. CHX, cycloheximide; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide.</div></div>
