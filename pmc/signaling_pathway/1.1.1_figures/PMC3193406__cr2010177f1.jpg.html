Canonical pathway is triggered by numerous signals, including those mediated by innate and adaptive immune receptors. It involves activation of IKK complex by Tak1, IKK-mediated IκBα phosphorylation, and subsequent degradation, resulting in rapid and transient nuclear translocation of the prototypical NF-κB heterodimer RelA/p50. Non-canonical NF-κB pathway relies on phosphorylation-induced p100 processing, which is triggered by signaling from a subset of TNFR members. This pathway is dependent on NIK and IKKα, but not on the trimeric IKK complex, and mediates the persistent activation of RelB/p52 complex.</div></div>
