Binding of TRAIL to DR4 or DR5 leads to activation of caspase-8 through FADD. Activated caspase-8 can directly activate effector caspase-3, -6, and -7 via the extrinsic pathway or cleave Bid and activate the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated pathway. Initiation of the latter pathway leads to activation of effector caspases through caspase-9. Activation of caspase-3, -6, and -7 leads to apoptosis. TRAIL resistance can occur at several levels. At the outer membrane, TRAIL sensitivity can be reduced by DcR1 and/or DcR2 over-expression as well as by defective expression/function of DR4 and/or DR5 (1). At the DISC, down-regulation, degradation or inactivation of the initiator caspase-8 and/or increased expression of c-FLIP can lead to TRAIL resistance (2). At the mitochondria, defects in pro-apoptotic molecules (e.g., Bid, Bax, Bak, PUMA, Bim) and/or up-regulation of proteins able to prevent cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1) also interfere with TRAIL signaling (3). Finally, members of the IAP family prevent the activation of both caspase-9 and caspase-3, -6 and -7 (4). →indicates activation, ⊥ indicates inhibition.</div></div>
