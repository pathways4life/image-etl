TLR-bound MyD88 interacts with several proteins including IRFs, TRAF3, IRAK4 and IRAK1. On one hand, activated IRFs and TRAF3 initiates signaling cascades that lead to production of type I IFNs. One the other hand, IRAK1 is activated by IRAK4 in the TLR/MyD88/IRAK receptor complex. Subsequently, PKD1 is recruited to the TLR/MyD88 receptor complex by interacting with IRAK4 and IRAK1 and then activated by IRAKs. IRAK1-bound activated PKD1 leaves the TLR/MyD88 receptor complex and binds to TRAF6, which allows TRAF6 to interact with IRAK1, and leads to the ubiquitination of TRAF6. Ubiquitinated TRAF6 leads to the activation of TAK1, which in turn activates signaling cascades that lead to activation of MAPKs and NF-ÎºB, and subsequent production of pro- inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.</div></div>
