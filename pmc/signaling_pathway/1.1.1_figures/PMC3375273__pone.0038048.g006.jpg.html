In osteoclast precursors, TRAIL is not able to induce sufficient amount of signals to activate the downstream apoptosis signaling to induce apoptosis; instead, TRAIL induces signaling to activate TRAF6 after receptor engagement. TRAF6 is the key molecule linking cytoplasmic signaling to the nuclear transcriptional program in osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. These signals include activation of NF-ÎºB by a process of ubiquitination in which TRAF6 functions as an E3 ligase [36] and recruitment of the TAB1-TAB2-TAK1 complex, which lead to the osteoclast-specific event, that is, autoamplification of NFATc1, the master transcription factor for osteoclast differentiation [29], [30], [31].</div></div>
