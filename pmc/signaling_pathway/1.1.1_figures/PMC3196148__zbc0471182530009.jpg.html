The novel information in this study illustrates the existence of a ERK-JNK-c-JUN/ATF2 pathway that functions independently of ATF4 by assembling c-JUN-c-JUN or c-JUN-ATF2 dimers at AP-1 sites. Although not indicated for clarity, it is known that ATF2 also participates in activating ATF4-dependent genes by catalyzing histone acetylation (16, 48). The dashed lines indicate that the mechanism is unknown.</div></div>
