Moreover, the Arg/N-end rule pathway appears to have a neuroprotective role in neurons for the clearance of various proteotoxic C-terminal protein fragments implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. When the Arg/N-end rule pathway is genetically or chemically inhibited, RGS4 levels are elevated to hydrolyze GTP of G protein's Î± subunit, which results in inactivation of GPCR signaling.</div></div>
