(A) Time course of Slt2p phosphorylation after calcofluor treatment. Samples were collected at the indicated times after the addition of calcofluor. The levels of total Slt2p are shown as a loading control. (B) Slt2p phosphorylation in wild-type and fks1Δ strains growing logarithmically or after calcofluor treatment. (C) Comparative levels of Slt2p phosphorylation in wild-type and rim21Δ strains after caffeine, calcofluor, or thermal stress. WT, wild type.</div></div>
