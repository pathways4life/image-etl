This scheme shows the major interactions of insulin signaling involving the activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase cascade. This leads to the initial redox-mediated priming of the receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and its IRS proteins. The scheme also links the ligand activation bypass of insulin signaling mediated by reactive oxygen species. The steady-state level of tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins is regulated by PTPases, a family of enzymes that constitutes one of the key targets of regulation by reactive oxygen species.</div></div>
