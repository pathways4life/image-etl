A TLR signal induced by LPS has been shown to activate p42/p44 MAPK (ERK 1/2), p38 MAPK, PI3-K/PKB, and the tyrosine kinases Src and JAK-2 in macrophages (2, 15, 54). These signaling kinases are also important for Kupffer cell responses to LTA. Each box contains signaling kinases clearly involved in regulating the release of the cytokine shown below. The figure is based on the effects of specific signaling kinase inhibitors obtained in this report. Tyr-K, tyrosine class kinases; Ser/Thr-K, serine-threonine class kinases.</div></div>
