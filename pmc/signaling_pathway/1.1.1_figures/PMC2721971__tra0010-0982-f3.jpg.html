From: The EGFR-GEP100-Arf6-AMAP1 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Specific to Breast Cancer Invasion and Metastasis†. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Besides well-known EGFR signaling pathways that link to the cell invasion and migration via activation of Ser/Thr kinases, EGFR can evoke a novel pathway that leads to the cancer invasion and metastasis, in which phosphorylated Tyr1068 or Tyr1086 binds directly to the PH domain of GEP100. Through this binding, GEP100 activates Arf6 and its downstream signaling pathway employing AMAP1 as its effector. For functioning of this pathway, it is prerequisite that both Arf6 and AMAP1 are highly overexpressed, and that Tyr1068 or Tyr1086 is highly phosphorylated. This EGFR-GEP100-Arf6-AMAP1 pathway plays pivotal roles not only in the formation and function of invadopodia, but also in perturbation of the E-cadherin-based cell–cell adhesion. Arf6 can be ubiquitinated by Fbx8, a component of the SCF complex. Loss of Fbx8 expression is frequently observed in different breast cancer cells, and contributes to their invasiveness. Monoubiquitination of AMAP1 by Cbl, via AMAP1's binding to CIN85, is also necessary for the invasion.</div></div>
