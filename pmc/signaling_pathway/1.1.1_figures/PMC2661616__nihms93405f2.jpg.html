RAGE is activated by its ligand, and signals are relayed to three potential pathways. Among the identified signaling routes, NF-ÎºB pathway is best studied and is likely to play major role in RAGE signaling-mediated inflammation. Depending upon ligand type, these pathways are either selectively activated, or, crosstalk, to regulate cellular activities.</div></div>
