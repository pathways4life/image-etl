From: NONCANONICAL WNT11 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">SIGNALING</span> AND CARDIOMYOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A unifying model of Wnt signaling with regard to cardiomyogenesis. Illustrated at the left is the canonical pathway, similar to that in Figure 1A, with the presence of Dkk-1. Dkk-1 can promote cardiac differentiation via canonical inhibition as well as by activating JNK via unclear mechanisms. The G-proteins have also been linked to the canonical pathway. The illustration to the right provides an alternative portrayal of the noncanonical signaling pathway as a single entity. In this model, activation of the heterotrimeric G-protein-linked Fz receptor by Wnt ligand initiates a multifaceted signaling cascade that includes activation of phospholipase C, which generates inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). IP3 mediates cytoplasmic Ca2+ accumulation via its entry from the extracellular space and its release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This Ca2+ influx activates PKC (also activated via DAG) and CaMKII. Activation of Frz receptor also activates Dsh responsible for activation of Ca2+-dependent PKC and CaMKII signaling via direct interaction with the βγG-protein subunits, and/or by forming a Dsh/PKC protein complex that drives PKC-dependent JNK signaling. Rho/Rac may also activate JNK via PKC. Although PKC phosphorylates and activates JNK, cardiogenic signaling is incompletely inhibited with JNK inhibition, suggesting other (unknown) transducing elements downstream from PKC, perhaps ultimately involving (ATF/CREB)-mediated transcriptional regulation.</div></div>
