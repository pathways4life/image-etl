Src kinase phosphorylation of caveolin-1Y14 also stimulates Rho-GTP loading and ROCK (an established downstream target of Rho) activation is necessary for PAI-1 induction. pCaveolin-1Y14-Rho-ROCK mediated signaling leads to inhibition of PTEN-PPM1A interactions resulting in a reduction of nuclear PPM1A phosphatase (black pathway), thereby, maintaining the pSMAD2/3 levels (highlighted in blue) required for PAI-1 induction by TGF-β1 (see text). PAI-1 is elevated in atherosclerotic plaques frequently colocalizing with α-smooth muscle actin-expressing cells, presumably VSMCs (insert).</div></div>
