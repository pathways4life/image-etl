From: Identifying new T-cell regulators. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">But unraveling this complex pathway and identifying all the players is a long and painstaking task. In this issue of Journal of Biology [1], Peter Chu, Jorge Pardo, Donald Payan, Charlene Liao and colleagues describe a large-scale functional genetic screen that is in theory capable of picking up most, if not all, of the molecules of the TCR signaling pathway. Their work will benefit researchers in immunology and other fields who are eager to identify all the players in a particular signaling pathway (see 'The bottom line' box for a summary of the work).</div></div>
