Upon ligand binding, the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) recruits and phosphorylates the type I receptor (TβRI) in the cell membrane, and then the activated type II-I heteromeric receptor complex can induce phosphorylation of R-SMADs. Activated R-SMADs can recruit Co-SMAD (SMAD4) for binding. The R-SMAD/Co-SMAD complexes translocate and accumulate in the nucleus and then initiate the expression of the target transcription factors with the help of other co-factors. TGF-β can in addition promote other intracellular (non-SMAD) signaling pathways, such as mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, and the Rho-like GTPase pathway</div></div>
