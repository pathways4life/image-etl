(a) Inhibition of Akt-mTOR signaling induced by DHA. PC3 (left) and DU145 (right) cells were incubated with 0−50 μM DHA for 24 h, and then the expression levels of Akt-mTOR pathway molecules were detected by Western blot analysis. (b) Effect of NAC on the expression levels of Akt-mTOR pathway molecules in DHA-treated cells. PC3 (left) and DU145 (right) cells were exposed to 50 μM DHA and/or 5 mM NAC for 12 h, and the expression levels of Akt-mTOR pathway molecules were examined by Western blot analysis.</div></div>
