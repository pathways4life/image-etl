PDGF-BB can promote VSMC proliferation by activating Erk/MAPK pathway after combining with its specific RTKs. The increasing cAMP concentration in VSMCs induces PKA activation, which can disturb Erk/MAPK signaling transduction by inhibiting c-Raf activation. SO2 derivatives can suppress the activities of Erk1/2, MEK1/2 and c-Raf, which does not result from separate targeting interferences of SO2 derivatives on the three molecules but from the inhibition of upstream signaling by SO2 derivatives. SO2 derivatives might enhance adenylyl cyclase activity to elevate cAMP production from ATP and then activate PKA signal to block c-Raf activation, which finally contributes to the suppression of PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation by SO2 derivatives</div></div>
