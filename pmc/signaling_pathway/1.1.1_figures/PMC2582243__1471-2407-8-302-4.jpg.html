MCF-10A cells were treated with MDA-MB-468 conditioned media for 0.5 hours. Treatment with 10 μM JSI-124 one hour prior to treatment with conditioned media reduced STAT3 activation. B. MCF-10A cells were treated with MDA-MB-231 conditioned media for 0.5 hours. Treatment with 10 μM JSI-124 one hour prior to treatment with conditioned media reduced STAT3 activation. C.
