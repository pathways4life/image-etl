(A) Depiction of the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. In response to cell damaging insults, pro-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family (e.g., Bax, Bim) are activated and they translocate to the mitochondria to neutralize anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL). This results in disruption of mitochondria which triggers the release of pro-apoptotic molecules from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Released cytochrome c clusters with APAF-1 and procaspase-9 in the presence of dATP to form the apoptosome to activate caspase-9. Activated caspase-9 cleaves and activates caspase-3, triggering a caspase cascade which ultimately results in the death of the cell. (B) GSK3 promotes the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway be regulating transcription factors that control the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, by promoting microtubule disruption and cell structural changes that occur during apoptosis, and by promoting disruption of mitochondria.</div></div>
