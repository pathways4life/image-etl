From: Induction of the Early Growth Response 1 Gene by Epstein-Barr Virus Lytic Transactivator Zta. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The ERK signaling pathway is activated by Zta and is important for Zta-mediated induction of Egr-1. (A) Activation of the ERK pathway by Zta. HONE-tetonZ and control HONE-1 cells were treated with (+) or without (−) doxycycline (dox) for 24 h and then subjected to an immunoblotting assay. Antibodies used to detect phosphorylated and total forms of p44/p42 ERK, p38 MAPK, and p54/p46 JNK were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. (B) Reduction of Zta-induced Egr-1 expression by inhibition of the ERK signaling pathway. HONE-tetonZ cells were left untreated or pretreated with solvent only (dimethyl sulfoxide) or inhibitors of ERK signaling (PD98059, 50 μM; U0126, 20 μM; Calbiochem) for 1 h and then subjected to treatment with doxycycline (dox) for 24 h. Protein expression was examined with an immunoblotting assay. (C) Inhibition of ERK activation impairs Elk-1 binding to the Egr-1 promoter. Nuclear extracts treated as indicated were subjected to EMSA with probe SE, which covers the most upstream SRE-Ets of the Egr-1 promoter (Fig. 4A and D). An immunoblotting assay was also performed to detect Elk-1 and phosphorylated and total p44/p42 ERKs in the nuclear extracts.</div></div>
