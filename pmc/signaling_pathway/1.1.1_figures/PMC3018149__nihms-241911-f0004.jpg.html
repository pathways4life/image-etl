From: Up Regulation of DLX5 Promotes Ovarian Cancer Cell Proliferation by Enhancing IRS-2-AKT <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">DLX5 knockdown attenuates AKT signaling pathway by down regulating upstream effectors. (A) AKT signaling is compromised by DLX5 knockdown in IGR-OV1 and OVCAR4 cells. Expression of p-PDK1/PDK1, p-AKT/AKT, p-GSK3, p-p70S6K and p-S6 were analyzed by Western blotting. (B) DLX5 knockdown reduces MET and IRS-2 expression. Levels of membrane receptor kinases MET, EGFR, HER2 and IGFR1, and adaptor proteins IRS-1 and IRS-2 were determined by immunoblotting. (C) DLX5 knockdown reduces MET/HGFR and IGFR signaling to AKT. IGR-OV1 and OVCAR4 cells with DLX5 knockdown were starved and treated with 10 ng/ml HGF or 50 ng/ml IGFI for 10 min. p-AKT/AKT levels were analyzed by immunoblotting. (D) myr-AKT protects cells from DLX5 knockdown-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. Ovarian cancer cells were co-transduced by viruses containing DLX5 shRNA and myr-AKT, and cell viability/proliferation was analyzed by WST-1 assay 5 days after infection. (E) Cyclin levels and Akt signaling diminished by DLX5 knockdown are restored by expression of myr-AKT.</div></div>
