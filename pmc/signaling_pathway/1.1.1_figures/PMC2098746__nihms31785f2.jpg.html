ErbB <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> regulates activation of PI3K and Erk MAPK pathways in Xenopus DMZ explants.  From: PI3K and Erk MAPK mediate ErbB <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in Xenopus gastrulation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">DMZ explants from embryos overexpressing ErbB4 (2ng mRNA/embryo), ErbB4-MO (20ng MO/embryo), p110caax (1ng mRNA/embryo), Î”p85 (1ng mRNA/embryo) or MEK* (1ng mRNA/embryo) were examined at gastrula stages for activation of PI3K (pAkt) or Erk MAPK (dpErk) pathways. Overexpression of ErbB4 enhanced, while depletion of ErbB4 reduced, the levels of both pAkt and dpErk. p110caax and MEK* stimulated pAkt and dpErk, respectively; but they also weakly increased phosphorylation of the other pathway component, suggesting a crosstalk between the two pathways.</div></div>
