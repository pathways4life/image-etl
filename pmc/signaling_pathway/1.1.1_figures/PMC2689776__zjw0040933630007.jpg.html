However, in response to high LET IR, these cells start a proapoptotic signaling through an early activation of JNK. Left, a hypothetical explanation is that high LET IR causes a decrease of 14-3-3 and possibly phosphorylation of c-Abl by JNK (I). As a consequence, c-Abl cannot form a complex with 14-3-3 (II) and is allowed to translocate to the nucleus (III) where it is activated by IR-induced DNA damage that in turn through activation of MKK4 mediates a late JNK activation (IV). This subsequently leads to activation of various proapoptotic signaling molecules and activation of mitochondria resulting in an apoptotic cell death. JNK may also phosphorylate the transcriptional factor c-Jun, which can increase expression of Fas ligand (V) and thereby activate non-mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signaling (VI). High LET IR also deactivates p38 that in turn inhibits the IGF-1R-mediated survival signaling in these NSCLC cells (VII). Right, in contrast, low LET IR can neither activate JNK-mediated apoptotic signaling (VIII) nor inhibit p38-mediated survival signaling via the IGF-1R/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (IX). As a result, U-1810 cells can resist low LET IR-induced apoptotic cell death. Fas R, Fas receptor; cyt. c, cytochrome c. FOX, Forkhead box.</div></div>
