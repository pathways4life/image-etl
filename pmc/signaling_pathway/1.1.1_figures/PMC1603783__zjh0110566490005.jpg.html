Overall FAK activation may be primarily accomplished by direct GFR signaling. However, in certain morphologically defined regions (perivascular, perinecrotic, tumor infiltration zone), in which extracellular matrix components (ECM) are present, integrins are up-regulated in a GFR-overexpressed background and might enhance FAK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, potentially resulting in increased motility and transcription.</div></div>
