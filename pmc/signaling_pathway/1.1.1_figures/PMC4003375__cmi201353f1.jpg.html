From: Nck, a missing adaptor between the B-cell receptor complex and the BCAP/PI3K/Akt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Nck proteins as the newly identified adaptors between the BCR complex and BCAP/PI3K/Akt pathway. After BCR crosslinking, Nck proteins bind to phosphorylated Tyr204 at the tail of Igα via their SH2 domains to recruit BCAP through their SH3 domains. Nck may control BCR signaling by activating the BCAP/PI3K/Akt pathway and cross-talking with other pathways. BCAP, B-cell adaptor for PI3K; BCR, B-cell antigen receptor; Igα, immunoglobulin-α PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SH3, Src-homology 3.</div></div>
