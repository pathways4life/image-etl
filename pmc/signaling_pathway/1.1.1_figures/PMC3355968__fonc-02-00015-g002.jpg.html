From: Regulation of Ubiquitination-Mediated Protein Degradation by Survival Kinases in Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Regulation of Mcl-1 and Snail by AKT, ERK, and IKK signaling pathway</b>. <b>(A)</b> AKT and ERK phosphorylates GSK3β and inhibit it. GSK3β phosphorylates Mcl-1 and induces its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via β-TrCP, Mule, and/or FBW7. ERK also directly phosphorylates Mcl-1, and phosphorylated Mcl-1 interacts with Pin1, resulting in its stabilization. The IKK–NF-κB pathway also contributes to Mcl-1 upregulation but the mechanisms are uncertain. <b>(B)</b> AKT and ERK phosphorylates GSK3β and inhibit it. GSK3β phosphorylates Snail and induces its nuclear exclusion, ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via β-TrCP. ERK also upregulates Snail transcription via AP-1 transcription factor. The IKK–NF-κB pathway inhibits Snail via upregulation of CSN2, which interferes with the GSK3–Snail interaction and ubiquitination of Snail.</div></div>
