From: Interaction between Interleukin-1 Receptor 2 and Toll-like Receptor 4, and Cervical Cytokines. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Cross-talk between TLR4 and IL-1 signaling pathways. Activation of TLR4 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) initiates a signal through the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (JAK-STAT1) pathway as well as through tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). IL-1 signal transduction is initiated through the TRAF6 signaling pathway by the binding of either IL-1α or IL-1β to the IL-1R1/IL-1RAP complex. The IL-1R2/IL-1RAP complex competes for the binding of IL-1α and IL-1β and does not produce a signal when bound, therefore limiting the availability of IL-1α or IL-1β to bind to the IL-1R1/IL-1RAP complex. A dashed line indicates that other signaling molecules not shown are also involved in the pathway.</div></div>
