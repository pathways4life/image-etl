From: mTOR inhibition in macrophages of asymptomatic HIV+ persons reverses the decrease in TLR4-mediated TNF? release through prolongation of MAPK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> activation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Working model describing how in HIV+ macrophages constitutively activated PI3K elicits blunting of lipid A-induced increases in TNFα release through sustained mTOR activation. PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway is constitutively active in HIV+ macrophages and inhibits the expression of TNFα by 1) direct mTOR-dependent inhibition of MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. 2) IL-10 production through the activation of mTOR. 3) destabilization a pan specific MAP kinase phosphatase,(MKP-1) expression through declines in its phosphorylation status, Inhibition of MKP-1 elicited negative feedback on ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation prolongs ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 activation by declines in its dephosphorylation.</div></div>
