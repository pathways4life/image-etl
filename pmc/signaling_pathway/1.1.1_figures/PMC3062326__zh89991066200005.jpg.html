(A-D) Flt3−LSKs were sorted from bone marrow cells of 2 pairs of Mx1Cre-GABPαFL/− and control mice and subjected to microarray analysis using GeneChip Mouse GENE 1.0 ST arrays. Genes exhibited significant expression changes (&gt; 1.5 fold and P &lt; .05) were analyzed using pathway analysis tools in DAVID bioinformatics resources. Heatmaps of genes in each pathway are shown. Color-coded scale bar indicates Z-score values, denoting number of standard deviations from the mean in each row. Asterisks denote genes containing GABP binding within 2 kb of their TISs as identified by ChIP-Seq. (A) KEGG apoptosis pathway. (B) KEGG Wnt signaling pathway. (C) BioCarta adipocytokine signaling pathway. (D) Rac1 cell mobility signaling pathway. (E) Venn diagram showing the overlap of GABP-bound genes and down-regulated or up-regulated genes because of GABPα deficiency.</div></div>
