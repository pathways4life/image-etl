Mechanical sensation of cilia induced by fluid flow activates the LKb1-AMPK pathway in a calcium independent manner and inhibits mTOR1 pathway. Mechanical flow induces activation of PC1 and PC2 and results in elevation of internal calcium level, which suppresses cAMP signaling. In addition, calcium is required for PC1-CT targeting into the nucleus. PC1 also activates JAK2, which induces gene expression that promotes cell cycle progression. Ligand binding of PDGFRÎ± in the cilia activates RAF-ERK pathway. Activation of cAMP signaling promotes PKA and AKAP activity, triggering cell cycle progression whereas calcium inhibits this pathway. In addition, aberrant activation of wnt or hedgehog pathway stimulates cell cycle progression.</div></div>
