Proposed mechanism of HGF-mediated suppression..  From: Hepatocyte Growth Factor Modulates Interleukin-6 Production in Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages: Implications for Inflammatory Mediated Diseases. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The canonical signaling pathway of LPS-TLR engagement leads to NFκB dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production through the interaction of CBP with NFκB. However, TLR signaling has also been shown to weakly activate alternative signaling through PI3K, resulting in phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3β, subsequent sequestration of CBP from NFκB to phospho-CREB, and resultant anti-inflammatory (IL-10) production[7]. Our results show that the presence of HGF enhances the IL-10 pathway. We postulate that in order to resolve inflammation, the generation of IL-6 by LPS-TLR signaling leads to the production of HGF, ultimately leading to the inhibition of inflammation. Hence, we propose HGF acts as an internal rheostat for resolving acute phase inflammatory responses.</div></div>
