In normoxia, hyperglycemic PKC activation, AGEs formation, mitochondrial ROS, and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β and TNF-α) decreases the degradation (through impairing proteasomal system) and/or increases the expression of HIF (through activating NF-κB). The elevated cytoplasmic HIF proteins may switch glucose metabolism from aerobic respiration to fermentation giving rise to lactate accumulation (also see Fig. 4a). The hyperglycemia-induced excess cytosolic HIF proteins may also lead to increased autophagy, while the lysosomal proteases are impaired by hyperglycemia. The combination of the two effects may also results in the accumulation of lysosomal lipofuscin. In addition, the excess cytosolic HIF proteins, such as an ubiquitinated form of HIF-1α induced by TNF-α, can also transactivate HIF-inducible genes (also see Fig 9b). However, under hypoxia the hyperglycemia-induced HIF protein is more stable.Fig. 9b. Hypoxic, hyperglycemic HIF pathway. In hypoxia, the transactivation activity of HIF is turned on because both oxygen sensors, PHD and FIH, become inactive. This eliminates proteasomal degradation of HIF proteins. The HIF proteins are further stabilized by hypoxia-induced HSP90 and bind to the HREs in the promoter or enhancer region of HIF-inducible genes to transactivate the transcriptions of the genes. The HIF pathway consists of many HIF-inducible genes, which encode a wide range of proteins, including RAGE, glycolytic enzymes, GLUTs, Epo, and VEGF. The hyperglycemic, hypoxic HIF pathway may be enhanced by hyperglycemic AGE formation and PKC activation, which can activate RAGE signaling cascades and increase HIF expression. Furthermore, in adaptation of lower efficiency of ATP generation from fermentation, the activation of GLUTs and glycolytic enzymes increase glucose uptake and up-regulate the glycolysis pathway (also see Fig. 4b). Therefore, in hyperglycemic, hypoxic conditions the HIF pathway may further deteriorate the four glycolysis-associated pathways and lactate accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the hyperglycemia-induced excess cytosolic HIF proteins may also enhance autophage, while the lysosomal system is impaired by hyperglycemia. Together, they may also result in the accumulation of lysosomal lipofuscin. In addition, hyperglycemia-induced proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β and TNF-α) can further enhance the HIF pathway.</div></div>
