Scheme for CLCA1/MAPK13 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> to mucus production..  From: IL-13-induced airway mucus production is attenuated by MAPK13 inhibition. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The CLCA1/MAPK13 signaling pathway is initiated when environmental stimuli (e.g., allergen or virus) stimulate IL-13 production and subsequent activation of IL-13 receptor on the surface of mucous precursor cells. IL-13 receptor activation leads to STAT6 activation and consequent induction of CLCA1 gene expression. The CLCA1 protein is secreted as N-terminal and C-terminal CLCA1 (N-CLCA1 and C-CLCA1) peptide fragments that might activate a putative CLCA1 receptor and in turn MAPK13 to drive a consequent increase in mucin (especially MUC5AC) gene expression and mucus production in airway mucous cells. </div></div>
