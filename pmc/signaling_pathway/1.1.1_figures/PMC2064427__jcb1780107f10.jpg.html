From: BMP gradients steer nerve growth cones by a balancing act of LIM kinase and Slingshot phosphatase on ADF/cofilin. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Schematic diagram illustrating the signaling mechanisms that control the bidirectional responses of the growth cone to BMP7 gradients.</b> In 4–8-h neurons, BMP7 induces an attractive response through the LIMK pathway. In overnight neurons, BMP7 repels the growth cone through the CaN–SSH phosphatase pathway, which is activated by Ca2+ signaling through TRP channels. ADF/cofilin acts as the common downstream target of these two signaling pathways to locally regulate the actin cytoskeleton for distinct turning responses. PM, plasma membrane.</div></div>
