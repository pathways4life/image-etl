The Rap pathway is shown in yellow: EphA activation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of SPAR, a RapGAP that binds to EphA4 through its PDZ domain. SPAR then inactivates Rap. The RhoA pathway is shown in light blue: Upon ephrin-A treatment, EphA recruits and phosphorylates Cdk5, which in turn phosphorylates and activates a RhoGEF, ephexin, activating RhoA. RhoA then activates ROCK, leading to dendritic spine retraction (as shown by the dashed pink box). The dashed blue box indicates the part of this pathway that has been shown to be important for growth cone collapse. The Rac pathway is shown in green: Activation of EphA receptors leads to binding and phosphorylation of the RacGAP α2-chimaerin, which then inactivaes Rac1 in cortical neurons, leading to growth cone collapse. In retinal axons, ephrin binding to EphA receptors leads to activation of the Rho family GEF Vav2, which then activates Rac1. Vav2-mediated activation of Rac1 leads to endocytosis of the membrane, eventually leading to growth cone collapse. In reverse signaling, ephrin-A associates with the p75-NTR receptor. This complex works to phosphorylate Fyn and cause axon repulsion from EphA-expressing cells when EphA binds ephrin-A. <b>B: ephrin–A-EphA signaling in the vascular system</b>. There is limited information on how this signaling regulates angiogenesis, but ephrin-A expression is known to be regulated by HIF-2α expression in surrounding tissue and signaling through EphA in the vascular system can lead to angiogenesis in tumor models. <b>C: ephrin–B-EphB signaling in the nervous system</b>. EphB is recruited to the membrane by GRIP1, a multi-PDZ domain scaffolding protein. The Rac1 pathway is shown in green: Rac1 is activated by the GEFs Kalirin and Tiam1. Both Tiam1 and Kalirin bind to and are phosphorylated by the activated receptor and then activate Rac1, leading to increased dendrite morphogenesis. The RhoA pathway is shown in blue: EphA activation leads to phosphorylation of FAK, which then activates RhoA, activating ROCK and leading to increased dendrite morphogenesis. For reverse signaling through the ephrin-B ligand, several adaptor proteins are required. GRIP1 binds to ephrin-B3 and is perhaps involved in clustering it at the synapse. The SH2-SH3 domain containing adaptor protein Grb4 binds ephrin-Bs and links them with multiple downstream regulators and enhancing dendrite morphogenesis in the ligand-expressing cell. <b>D: ephrin-B–EphB signaling in the vascular system</b>. EphB activation leads to the activation of RhoA and ROCK. In addition, EphB signaling enhances SFD/CXCR4 signaling as seen by increased phosphorylation of Akt. Both pathways lead to endothelial cell migration and sprouting. For reverse signaling, ephrin-B binds the SH2-SH3 domain containing adaptor protein Grb4, leading to vessel sprouting, presumably through multiple downstream regulators recruited by Grb4.</div></div>
