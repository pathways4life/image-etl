From: PROSTATE CANCER: Re-focusing on Androgen Receptor <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proliferation induced by androgen independent pathways. (A) Hypersensitive pathway: Lower levels of androgen can activate signaling through the AR transcription factor. This state is usually achieved by amplification of the receptor itself, but it can also occur in the presence of activating mutations. (B) Promiscuous pathway: Mutations allow non-androgenic steroid hormones to bind and activate AR signaling. (C) Outlaw pathway: AR is activated independently of ligand binding by growth factors, cytokines, interleukins, cytoplasmic kinases or nuclear co-activators. Importantly A, B and C rely in the presence of an active AR complex. (D) Bypass pathway: Alternative survival pathways are activated and promote proliferation in the absence of androgens. The presence of an active AR is not required. Classification adapted from (Feldman and Feldman, 2001).</div></div>
