In the latter case, CXCR7 changes the conformation of the CXCR4/G-protein complexes and abrogates signaling. Activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12 leads to G-protein coupled signaling through PI3K/Akt, IP3, and MAPK pathways, which promote cell survival, proliferation and chemotaxis. In addition, the β-arrestin pathway can be activated through GRK to internalize CXCR4. When CXCR7 binds CXCL12, the classical GPCR mobilization of Ca2+ does not occur, and activation of the β-arrestin pathway may lead to scavenging of CXCL12. In certain cancer cells (e.g., glioma) CXCR7 can also signal through PLC/MAPK to increase cell survival.</div></div>
