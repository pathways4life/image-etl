Protein glycosylation can regulate <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> specificity.

Fringe is a glycosyltransferase that modifies Notch and enhances a Delta-specific response (green arrows) while inhibiting Serrate/Jagged-specific responses (red arrows). B) Two yeast MAPK pathways that share components. Nutrient limitation activates the filamentous growth pathway through Msb2 (green arrows). Osmotic stress activates the HOG pathway through Msb2 and Hkr1 (red arrows). Reduced glycosylation of Msb2 specifically triggers the filamentous growth pathway through a core module composed of proteins that are shared between the two pathways, shown in grey. The lighter dashed red arrows designate a function for Msb2 in the HOG pathway.</div></div>
