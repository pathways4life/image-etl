We propose that a complex formed between Xfz4S and Wnt-3a/-8/-8b could be recognized by LRP and Wnt signaling could be activated in LRP dependent manner. Complexes between Xfz4S and Wnt-4/-5a/-11 would not be recognized by LRP and Xfz4S and Wnt/β-catenin signaling would not be activated by these Wnts.</div></div>
