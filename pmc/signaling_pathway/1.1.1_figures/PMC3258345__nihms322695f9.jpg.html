Proposed interaction between RAR/RXR and oxidative stress/JNK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>.

Retinoic acid, through activation of RAR/RXR-mediated signaling, inhibits intracellular oxidative stress and the JNK pathway, protecting cardiomyocytes from HG-induced apoptosis. High glucose promotes oxidative stress, which leads to activation of the JNK pathway and degradation of RAR/RXR, resulting in repression of RAR/RXR signaling. Impaired RAR/RXR signaling further potentiates intracellular oxidative stress and activation of JNK-mediated apoptotic signaling.</div></div>
