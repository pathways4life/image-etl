From: Expression and mutation analyses implicate ARHGAP29 as the etiologic gene for the cleft lip with or without cleft palate locus identified by genome wide association on chromosome 1p22. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The hypothetical pathway links the IRF6 gene regulatory network (IRF6, TP63, TFAP2A, and TGFB3, all previously implicated in craniofacial development) with the Rho signaling pathway through ARHGAP29. This pathway may also involve WNT and TGFB3, which can signal through the Rho pathway, and are required for craniofacial development. We propose that decreased ARHGAP29 would maintain Rho in an active state, which would negatively regulate processes critical for craniofacial development such as cellular migration.
