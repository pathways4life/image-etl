From: STAT3 is involved in phosphatidic acid-induced Bcl-2 expression in HeLa cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A proposed model for the signaling pathway of PA-induced Bcl-2 expression. We diagramed a mechanism of up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression induced by PA. PA can be converted to LPA by PLA2, but does not pass through the DAG pathway by PAP. Subsequently, LPA acts as an important signal molecule to upregulate Bcl-2 expression. PA leads to activation of downstream kinases, ERK1/2, which are responsible for the phosphorylation of STAT3 (Ser727).</div></div>
