From: Distinctive G Protein-Dependent <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> by Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) in Smooth Muscle: Feedback Inhibition of RhoA by cAMP-Independent PKA. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In gastric smooth muscle PAR2 receptors are coupled to Gq, G13 and Gi1/2, and stimulation of PI hydrolysis via Gaq and Gbgi1/2, and RhoA/Rho kinase via Ga13. Initial contraction is mediated via PLC-b/Ca2+/MLCK pathway whereas sustained contraction is mediated via RhoA/Rho kinase pathway. Although PAR2 receptors are coupled to inhibition of cAMP via Ga i1/2, activation of NF-kB pathway via Ga13/RhoA leads to degradation of IkB and activation of PKA that result in attenuation of Rho kinase activity in a feedback mechanism via phosphorylation of RhoA at Ser188 by PKA.</div></div>
