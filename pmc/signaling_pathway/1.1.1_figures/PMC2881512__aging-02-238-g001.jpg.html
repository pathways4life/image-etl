In mammals, nutrients are                                             sensed by a G-protein (GEF) that activates an adenylyl cylase (AC).  AC                                             produces cAMP, which binds to the regulatory subunits (R) of the PKA                                             holoenzyme, releasing the catalytic subunits (C), which are then free to                                             enter the nucleus of the cell and activate gene transcription or to                                             interact with other signaling proteins in the cell.                                                              </div></div>
