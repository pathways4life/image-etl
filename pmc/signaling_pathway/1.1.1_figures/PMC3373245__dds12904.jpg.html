Total RNA was extracted from P2 calvarial tissues of WT and miR-34c Tg mice. The expression level of Notch receptors (<b>A</b>), Notch ligands (Jag1 and Dll4), Rbpjk and Hey1 (<b>B</b>), osteoblast markers (<b>C</b>) and Opg and Rankl (<b>D</b>) were quantified by qRTâ€“PCR and normalized to B2m (n = 6). *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01. Error bar is SEM. (<b>E</b>) Diagram of miR-34c-mediated regulation of bone development. MiR-34c regulates both osteoclasts and osteoblasts via targeting multiple factors in the Notch signaling pathway and Runx2 and Satb2, respectively, during skeletal development. The direct targets of miR-34c are in bold.</div></div>
