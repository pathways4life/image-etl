(a-c) Microarray data analysis of OSM signaling in PP cells versus cultured cells. Genes with higher expression in PP cells are in pink, those expressed less well in PP cells are in green, those not expressed are in grey (IL6ST, interleukin-6 signal transducer). The OSM signaling pathway was intact, although STAT3 was upregulated in cultured cells, probably explaining the responsiveness of P3 cells to added OSM.</div></div>
