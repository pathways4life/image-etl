(<b>B</b>) Integrated signaling network of metabolic enzymes and metabolites obtained with Ingenuity pathway analysis. Clusters of significantly enriched canonical pathways and related enzymes and metabolites are highlighted. Upregulated enzymes in green, downregulated enzymes in red. Upregulated metabolites in dark red, downregulated metabolites in blue.</div></div>
