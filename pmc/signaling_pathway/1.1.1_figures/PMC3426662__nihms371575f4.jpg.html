Two forms of Notch activity in CNS longitudinal axon growth in Drosophila.

Canonical, nuclear Notch signaling in glial cells (green) promotes morphogenesis of the substratum for approaching pioneer axons (dMP2, vMP2; black). “Non-canonical”, cytoplasmic Notch signaling in the growth cones of the pioneer axons drives their extension alongside the glia. Ligand for both Notch functions is provided by the axons of commissural interneurons that bear Delta protein (pink), and that cross the longitudinal pathway. It is likely that there is also some level of canonical Notch signaling occurring in the pioneer neurons (light gray nuclei). CNS midline is indicated to the right; Delta+ commissural interneurons are located laterally in the nerve cord (left).</div></div>
