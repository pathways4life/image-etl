Signaling proteins associated with TGFβ (a) and FGF (b) pathway regulation are shown. Components or processes that currently can be targeted by small molecules to achieve selective pathway control are labeled with green (agonist) and red (antagonist) hexagons. Direct small molecule–protein interactions are depicted when known.</div></div>
