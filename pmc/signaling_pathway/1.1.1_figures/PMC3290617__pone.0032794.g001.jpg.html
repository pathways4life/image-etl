Activation of this pathway will elicit pro-inflammatory cytokine release (e.g. tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)), mitochondrial and intracellular ROS production and impairment of the insulin sensitivity at the molecular level. More mitochondrial ROS production is associated with an increased expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2), suggesting that SOD2 only acts as mitochondrial stress marker (indicated as dotted line). The formed ROS will not only induce the IKK complex phosphorylation and thereby the translocation of NFκB but will also lead to inhibition of the insulin receptor signaling pathway. Interestingly, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-3 (IRAK3) and miR-146b-5p are located upstream of the transcription factor NFκB and negatively regulates TLR signaling. IRAK3 prevents the dissociation of IRAK1 and IRAK4 from MyD88 and formation of IRAK-TRAF6 complexes. miR-146b-5p, on the other hand, inhibits the translation of IRAK1 and TRAF6. Flow of the pathway at the protein interaction level is indicated by black arrows. Blunted arrows indicate inhibition. Phosphorylation is indicated by a circled P.</div></div>
