Black arrows represent signaling pathway connections; green arrows represent pharmacological agents that serve as agonists or activators; red lines represent small molecule inhibitors. In light blue are 3 possible effectors of cAMP signaling in NS-1 cells, including the regulatory subunit of PKA (Reg), Epac, and the neuritogenic cAMP sensor. Diagram is not to scale, and components depicted are not necessarily placed in their actual cellular compartments.</div></div>
