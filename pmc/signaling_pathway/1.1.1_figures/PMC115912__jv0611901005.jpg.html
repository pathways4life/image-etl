WI38 cells were first infected with empty vector or Δ-N β-catenin-expressing lentiviruses and then infected with adenoviruses. (A) Western blot showing DBP expression 24 h after infection with wild-type Ad5 and vMB31. (B) PCR quantitation of adenoviral E1B and E2 mRNA 24 h after infection with wild-type Ad5 and vMB31 (upper two panels), and burst assay for virus production 48 h after infection with wild-type Ad5 and vMB31 (lower panel). The viral titer was measured by plaque assay on SW480.</div></div>
