Only canonical (classical) pathway is shown. Extracellular stimuli transmitted though receptor complexes activate IKK via phosphorylation. Consequently, IKK phosphorylates IκB, leading to its dissociation from inactive NF-κB complex and ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Freed from IκB, active NF-κB dimer translocates into the nucleus and induces the transcription of various target genes involved in multiple cellular pathways. Cancer-relevant mutations, indicated in orange boxes, can occur in all steps of NF-κB signaling cascade.</div></div>
