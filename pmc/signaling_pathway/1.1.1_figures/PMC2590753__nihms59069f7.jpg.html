Transmitter binding to postsynaptic receptors on SCN neurons evokes a series of intracellular signal transduction events, including MAPK pathway activation. One downstream target of the MAPK cascade is CREB, which, when phosphorylated on Ser-133, drives clock gene transcription. Light-induced activation of the MAPK cascade also stimulates mTORC1, which in turn targets the translation regulators p70 S6K and 4E-BP1. Activated p70 S6K stimulates S6 phosphorylation, whereas 4E-BP1 phosphorylation has been shown to lead to its dissociation from eIF4E, thereby allowing cap-dependent mRNA translation to occur. U0126 is a specific MEK 1/2 inhibitor and rapamycin inhibits mTORC1.</div></div>
