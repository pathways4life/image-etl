Canonical Smad-dependent TGF-β signaling first binds to receptor type II (R-II) and receptor type I (R-I), and then signaling transduces to their Smads. Activated Smads form a complex with Smad4 and then translocate into the nucleus where they interact with other transcription factors to trigger target gene expression. Smad7 disrupts the activated Smad2/3 to form a complex with Smad4. The non-Smad-dependent TAK1 signaling pathway also regulates bone formation. PTH binding activates PTH1R to stimulate several downstream effectors. PTH binding also drives internalization of PTH1R-TGFβRII complex, which attenuates both TGF-β and PTH signaling on bone development. Transcriptional factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) mediates PTH signaling in osteoblasts. P: phosphorylation; Ub: ubiquitination.</div></div>
