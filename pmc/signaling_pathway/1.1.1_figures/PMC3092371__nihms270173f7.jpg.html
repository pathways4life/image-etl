From: Disrupting Function of FK506-Binding Protein 1b/12.6 Induces the Ca2+-Dysregulation Aging Phenotype in Hippocampal Neurons. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Working model of the role of FKBP1b in aging-related Ca2+ dyshomeostasis. <b>A</b>, In young subjects, neuronal FKBP1b exerts strong tonic inhibitory effects on two pathways: the Ca2+regulatory pathway and the mTOR signaling pathway. In the Ca2+regulatory pathway, FKBP1b inhibits cytosolic Ca2+ rises generated by extracellular influx via L-VGCCs (<b>1</b>) and intracellular release from RYRs (<b>2</b>), by inhibiting both channel types directly (<b>3</b>, <b>4</b>). In the mTOR pathway, FKBP inhibition of mTOR(<b>5</b>) helps maintain the balance between growth-stimulating and autophagy-suppressing effects of mTOR.<b>B</b>, With aging (mimicked by FKBP1b knockdown), a decline of FKBP1b expression/function leads to weakened inhibition of both pathways and concomitant increases in both Ca2+ and mTOR signaling. Increased Ca2+ signaling results in dampened neuronal excitability and function, whereas mTOR disinhibition leads to aberrant increases in growth signaling as well as decreased autophagy. <b>C</b>, Rapamycin in young subjects exerts opposite effects on FKBP inhibition in the two pathways, mimicking the effect of aging of weakened FKBP inhibition in the Ca2+ pathway (<b>B</b>) but paradoxically augmenting FKBP inhibition of the mTOR pathway (<b>C</b>).</div></div>
