From: Dmp1 and tumor suppression. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Dmp1 links the Rb and p53 pathways. The novel ‘Jun-Dmp1’ pathway links oncogenic Ras-Raf signaling and the Arf-p53 pathway. This pathway is independent of the classical cyclin D1/Cdk4-Rb-E2F signaling. E2Fs directly bind to the Dmp1 promoter and causes repression; thus they have differential effects on the Dmp1 and on the Arf promoter. Overexpression of D-cyclins inhibits the activity of Dmp1 in a Cdk-independent fashion; however, on the Arf promoter, Dmp1 and cyclin D1 act synergistically, and this activity is dependent on Cdks. Dmp1 might have other targets than Arf, especially in T lymphocytes.</div></div>
