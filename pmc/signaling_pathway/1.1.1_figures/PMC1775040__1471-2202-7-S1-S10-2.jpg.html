Overview of signaling pathways in the baker's yeast S. cerevisiae. From left to right: HOG pathway activated by osmotic shock, pheromone pathway activated by pheromones secreted by cells of the opposite mating type, pseudohyphal growth pathway stimulated by starvation conditions, and the glucose sensing pathway. In each pathway, the activated receptor activates a cascade of intracellular processes including complex formation, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and transport steps. Most of these pathways comprise a MAP kinase cascade and transcription factors that regulate the expression of target genes. Besides this, the signaling pathways can directly interact with cell cycle progression and adaptation of metabolism.</div></div>
