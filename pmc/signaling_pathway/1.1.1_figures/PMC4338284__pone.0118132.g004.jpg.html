This composite network merge three top networks based on “network score,” which converges on the ERK/MAPk pathway: specifically merging on Extracellular signal-related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 kinases subfamily. <b>Red</b> is up-regulated and <b>Green</b> is down-regulated.</div></div>
