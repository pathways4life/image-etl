From: Estrogen <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> and Cardiovascular Disease. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Figure 2 A illustrated the interaction of the genomic and acute estrogen signaling pathways in regulating nitric oxide (NO) signaling. Estrogen (E2) can bind to ER resulting in dimerization and activation of gene transcription. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression has been reported to be regulated by E2 and females have been shown to have higher levels of NOS than males. In addition, E2 active via rapid signaling pathways can activate the PI3K pathway regulating in phosphorylation and activation of NOS.Figure 2B illustrates how this signaling might be altered with aging and disease and provides a possible explanation as to why HRT failed to protect in post-menopausal women. Tetrahydropterin (BH4) is a cofactor for NOS and in the absence of BH4, NOS now generates ROS rather than NO.</div></div>
