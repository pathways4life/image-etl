The Notch receptors are produced as large proteins that are cleaved (S1) and inserted in the membrane as heterodimers. Upon ligand binding, two consecutive cleavages occur (S2 and S3), which release the ICN. In the nucleus, ICN forms a multimeric protein complex together with CSL and co-activators, and initiates transcription of target genes. See text for further details.</div></div>
