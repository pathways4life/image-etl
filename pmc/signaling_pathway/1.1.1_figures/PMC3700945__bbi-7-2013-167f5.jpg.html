The TNF pathway (purple) includes the TNFR ligands TNF and TNFRSF1A and culminates in the transcriptional activation of NFkB. The IL13 pathway (red), describes the molecular events leading to epithelial cell differentiation into mucin-producing goblet cells through the cytokine IL13 and the transcription factor, SPDEF. The SP-1 pathway (green) describes the routes leading to transcriptional activation of MUC5AC by the transcription factor SP-1, and includes the upstream signaling kinases, PKA, PKC and MAPK14. The AP-1 pathway (blue) includes the primary pathways that activate MUC5AC expression via EGFR activation and the signaling intermediate, reactive oxygen species (ROS).</div></div>
