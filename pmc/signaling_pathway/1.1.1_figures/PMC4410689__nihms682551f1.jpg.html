Both Canonical and Endoglin/ALK-1 TGF-Beta signaling is mediated by the phosphorylation of distinct receptor Smad proteins. Nuclear translocation requires Co-Smad binding in both pathways. Inside the nucleus, R- and Co-Smads form a complex with transcription factors to either repress or activate TGF-Beta related gene expression. The noncanonical pathway is mediated by TGFBRI, TRAF6, and TAK1 and results in the phosphorylation of MAPKs such as Erk1/2, JNK, and p38. These MAPKs can re-enter the Smad-dependent pathway through phosphorylation or mediate downstream signaling through other Smad-independent pathways. The lightning bolts represent mutations to the indicated proteins causative of the syndromes listed in red.</div></div>
