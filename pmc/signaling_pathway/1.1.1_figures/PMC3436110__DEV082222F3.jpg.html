To screen for pathways affected by Mkl2 deletion, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was applied to identify KEGG-designated signaling pathways that are coordinately induced or repressed in response to Mkl2 deletion. The most repressed pathway was TGFβ signaling (FDR q value&lt;0.0001). The heat map shown on the left displays the list of KEGG-designated genes in the TGFβ signaling pathway and their relative level of gene expression in biological replicate samples of Mkl2–/– (gray) and wild-type (yellow) ES cells. Red or blue signal indicates increased or decreased expression, respectively. Brightness is proportional to the difference from the median expression level. The NCBI gene identification names are listed on the right (see also Dünker and Krieglstein, 2002).</div></div>
