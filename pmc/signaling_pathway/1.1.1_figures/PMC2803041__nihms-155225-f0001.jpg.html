Protoplasts (2 × 104) from the snrk2.2/3/6 triple mutant were used except in (d), where protoplasts from the Col-0 wild-type plants were used. The RD29B::LUC and ZmUBQ::GUS were used as the ABA responsive reporter and internal control, respectively. After transfection, protoplasts were incubated for 5 h under light and in the presence of 0 (open bars) or 5 μM (solid bars) ABA. Error bars, mean ± s.e.m. (n=3).</div></div>
