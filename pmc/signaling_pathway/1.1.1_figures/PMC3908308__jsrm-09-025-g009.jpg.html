From: Regulated expression of CXCR4 constitutive active mutants revealed the up-modulated chemotaxis and up-regulation of genes crucial for CXCR4 mediated homing and engraftment of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A schematic figure representing the different groups of up-regulated genes based on their relation to the classical CXCR4 signaling at protein level, which altogether may contribute in likely up modulation of mutant downstream signaling. A. as downstream effectors of CXCR4 signaling, B. as positively associated members of CXCR4 activated downstream pathways (Phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, MAPK pathway), C. as positive regulators of CXCR4 signaling, D. genes whose protein product have established role in cell migration and chemotaxis but so far not reported to play a role in CXCR4 signaling.</div></div>
