This scheme summarizes the pathway from wounding to HCEC wound closure and includes EGFR transactivation and its downstream signaling. Wounding activates Src, which leads to the release of HB-EGF. The soluble form of HB-EGF then binds EGFR, which transduces the signals into the intracellular signaling pathways, including the activation of Src. After EGFR activation, HCEC migration, proliferation, and wound healing are induced through PI3K, ERK, and other intracellular signaling pathways. Activation of PI3K, but not ERK, pathway in HCECs after EGFR (trans)activation requires Src activation. Light solid arrows: novel findings reported in the present paper. Dash lines: remain to be determined.</div></div>
