L-CBM also controls the JNK, particularly JNK2, activation pathway through antigen receptors, leading to c-JUN activation. Upon antigen receptor stimulation, PKCθ in T cells and PKCβ in B cells phosphorylate CARMA1 in the PRD region (see Figure 4), enabling the formation and membrane recruitment of the L-CBM complex. IKKβ positively and negatively regulates L-CBM signaling. These signaling events are regulated by the recruitment of signaling components to specific membrane domains, such as lipid rafts, after receptor triggering. In MZ B cells, L-CBM mediates signals for canonical NF-κB activation through TLR4-Myd88. L-CBM also mediates signals for noncanonical NF-κB (RelB/p52) activation mediated by NIK and IKKα downstream of the BAFF receptor (BAFF-R), which regulates the survival of MZ B cells.</div></div>
