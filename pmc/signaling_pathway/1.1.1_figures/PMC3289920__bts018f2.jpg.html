(<b>A</b> and <b>A</b>′) NF-kB signaling pathway extracted from image (<b>B</b> and <b>B</b>′). (<b>C</b>) Pathway Palette explaining pathway elements. (<b>D</b>) Pathways similar (in gene/protein members) to opened pathway are shown on the ‘Similar Pathways’ tabbed panel. (<b>E</b>) Multi-experiment viewer represents microarray experiments that are most relevant (by number of differentially expressed pathway's gene members) searched over a wide variety of cell and tissue types. (<b>F</b>) Build Pathway Wizard (BPW) assists the user in finding regulatory paths, protein–protein, genetic and functional links, between selected objects, searches for common targets or regulators for the group of molecules, finds connection to canonical and other imaging pathways. (<b>G</b>) Node properties, (<b>H</b>) Link properties, including Abstracts from PudMed publications from which the link was extracted. (<b>I</b>) ‘Like/Don’t Like' buttons for pathway quality evaluation and users' comments.</div></div>
