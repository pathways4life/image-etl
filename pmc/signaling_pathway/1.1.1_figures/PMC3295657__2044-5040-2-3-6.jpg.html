IL-1α and TNF-α induced secretion of Activin A in differentiating HuSKMCs cells and this secreted Activin A mediated their effects. Release of Activin A was dependent on <b>t</b>ransforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1/p38/nuclear factor κB pathway activation, but independent of SMAD2/3 signaling. The released Activin A subsequently inhibited differentiation via ALK/SMAD2/3 signaling.</div></div>
