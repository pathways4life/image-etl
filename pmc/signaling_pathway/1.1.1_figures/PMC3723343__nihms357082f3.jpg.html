Cripto binding to cell surface GRP78 promotes stemness and the tumorigenic phenotype.  From: Cripto/GRP78 modulation of the TGF-? <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> in development and oncogenesis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(<b>A</b>) The cell surface Cripto/GRP78 complex interaction required for Cripto regulation of the Smad2/3 pathway both as a Nodal co-receptor and antagonist of activin and TGF-β signaling. Soluble Cripto also binds cell surface GRP78 to cause activation of PI3K and MAPK signaling via activation of Src. The effects of Cripto/GRP78 signaling on Src/MAPK/PI3K and Smad2/3 pathways are likely to function synergistically to promote stemness, plasticity and tumorigenesis. (<b>B</b>) The N-20 antibody blocks Cripto binding to cell surface GRP78 and inhibits Cripto-dependent signaling via MAPK, PI3K and Smad2/3 pathways. By blocking Cripto, this GRP78 antibody blocks Src/MAPK/PI3K pathway activation and enhances activin and TGF-β signaling thereby promoting cytostasis and tumor suppression.</div></div>
