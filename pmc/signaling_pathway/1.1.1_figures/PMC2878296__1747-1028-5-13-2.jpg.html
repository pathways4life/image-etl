From: Merotelic attachments and non-homologous end joining are the basis of chromosomal instability. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Signaling by spindle attachment defects</b>. Two independent pathways act to delay anaphase. The spindle attachment pathway senses kinetochore tension and is especially efficient for detecting monotelic and syntelic attachments, and the DNA damage pathway acts as an additional mechanism that responds to DSB generated by merotelic attachments. When kinetochore attachment defects are undetected, for example in tumors with a CIN phenotype (grey), merotelic attachments and DSB increase, leading to activation of the DNA damage pathway and ultimately to mitotic slippage.</div></div>
