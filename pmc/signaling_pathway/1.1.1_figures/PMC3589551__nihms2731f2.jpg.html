The cartoon illustrates induction of LTP by theta burst stimulations under physiological conditions (right), suppressed NRG1-ErbB4 signaling (top) and enhanced NRG1-signaling (bottom). Under physiological conditions, the NRG1-ErbB4 pathway is a partial brake on the induction of LTP as genetic or pharmacological suppression of this pathway increases the magnitude of the potentiation. Gain-of-function of NRG1-ErbB4 signaling may block induction of LTP.</div></div>
