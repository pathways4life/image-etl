From: Chromium-Insulin Reduces Insulin Clearance and Enhances Insulin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> by Suppressing Hepatic Insulin-Degrading Enzyme and Proteasome Protein Expression in KKAy Mice. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>The possible mechanisms of CRI enhancing insulin action and insulin signaling were shown in figure</b>. The CRI treatment may directly suppress IDE and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in the liver, and result in reduction of insulin clearance and degradation of proteins (such as IRS-1 and IRS-2) in the downstream of insulin signaling pathway. The consequent of CRI treatment enhances insulin signaling, increases insulin sensitivity, and improves glucose metabolism in insulin-resistant and diabetic conditions.</div></div>
