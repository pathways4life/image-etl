From: Lessons from Mouse Models of Thyroid Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Altered signaling pathways and mouse models of thyroid cancer. Mouse models are indicated by an (*). Aberrant signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as the RET and NTRK1 receptors induce papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Overactivation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (or MAPK signaling pathway) leads to PTC. The BRAFV600E mutation results in constitutive activation of BRAF and is commonly found in PTC. RAS overactivation is common to both papillary and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) models. TSH receptor (TSHR) signaling via adenyl cyclases/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) is important for normal thyroid growth, but only a few models of TSHR overactivation develop thyroid cancer (Prkar1aΔ2/+, Rap1bG12V). The adrenergic receptor may also contribute to thyroid cancer development also through increased cAMP and signaling via pathways such as MAPK and protein kinase C (PKC). Overactivation in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway via cell-surface receptors such TSHR or inactivation of the phosphatase, PTEN, are important for FTC tumorigenesis. TRßPV/PV mice also have PI3K-AKT overactivation and develop FTC. Please see text for additional details regarding these mouse models.</div></div>
