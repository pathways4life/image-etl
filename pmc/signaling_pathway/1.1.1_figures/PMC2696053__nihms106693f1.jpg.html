(A) Model for the major events in the Notch signaling pathway. Signals initiated by the engagement of ligand (1) lead to metalloprotease cleavage (MP) at site S2 (2). This proteolytic step allows the cleavage of Notch by the Î³-secretase complex at site S3 within the transmembrane domain (3), and release of intracellular notch (ICN) from the membrane (4). ICN translocates to the nucleus where it enters into a transcriptional activation complex with CSL and Mastermind (MAM;5). (B, C) The domain organization of Notch receptors (B) and DSL-family ligands (C) from fly, human and worm.</div></div>
