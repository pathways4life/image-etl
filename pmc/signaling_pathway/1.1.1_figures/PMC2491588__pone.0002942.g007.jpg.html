PTHR1 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Osteocytes Leads to Increased Bone Mass and Remodeling via Distinct Mechanisms..  From: Control of Bone Mass and Remodeling by PTH Receptor <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Osteocytes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In the proposed model, PTHR1 signaling in osteocytes activates at least two distinct pathways: one leading to increased bone mass and the other leading to increased bone remodeling. Suppression of Sost/sclerostin and activation of LRP5 signaling increase osteoblast numbers and are required for the increase in bone mass. The elevation of bone resorption is independent of the Sclerostin/LRP5 pathway. The question mark indicates uncertainty of the cellular source of RANKL and M-CSF (osteocytes versus stromal/osteoblastic cells).</div></div>
