(1) Upon FRc exposure, phyA localizes from the cytosol into the nucleus through direct interaction with FHY1/FHL (Genoud et al. 2008). (2) In the nucleus, the phyA signal is transmitted to two major transcription factors (HFR1 and LAF1) through FHY1/FHL to promote photomorphogenesis (Yang et al. 2009). However, FHY1/FHL does not directly transmit phyA signal to one of the major transcription factors, HY5. The unidentified factor X may be involved in the FHY1/FHL-dependent pathway. (3) Direct interaction between HY5 and HFR1 or LAF1 may modulate transcription factor abundance and hence signaling strength. Taken together, we proposed here that HY5 may share the FHY1/FHL signal through interactions with HFR1 and/or LAF1 (4). Alternatively, HY5 may transmit phyA signals through a FHY1/FHL-independent pathway (5). Gray arrows represent the direction of the phyA signaling pathway.</div></div>
