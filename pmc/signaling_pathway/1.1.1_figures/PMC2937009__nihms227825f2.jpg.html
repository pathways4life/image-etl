In muscle, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway controls many metabolic responses including glucose transport and protein degradation. Activated insulin receptors phosphorylate the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. The PI3K p85 regulatory subunit binds to the phosphorylated IRS protein and recruits the PI3K p110 catalytic subunit. The PI3K complex forms phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) triphosphate which then activates Akt. Akt serves as a nexus enzyme that phosphorylates a variety of downstream effectors. The activated insulin receptor also stimulates a parallel signaling cascade of kinases called the MEK/ERK pathway. Pathway signaling is initiated by the IRS proteins. It ultimately controls many cellular processes involved in cell growth and survival.</div></div>
