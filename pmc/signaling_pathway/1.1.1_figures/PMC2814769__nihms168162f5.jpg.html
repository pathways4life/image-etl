Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and the cilium.  From: The Primary Cilium as a Complex <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Center. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The cilium/basal body may function as a regulatory switch to control the balance between the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways. In the canonical pathway (A, left), a Wnt ligand binds to the co-receptors Frizzled and LRP. This inhibits the activity of the β-catenin destruction complex possibly through the Dishevelled (Dvl) protein and leads to stabilization of β-catenin., which accumulates in the nucleus and with LEF and TCF activates target genes. In the noncanonical pathway (A, right), Wnt binds to a frizzled receptor, independent of LRP. This activates a membrane form of Dvl which regulates downstream targets. The noncanonical Wnt signal activates Inversin, which resides in multiple locations in the cell including the cilium or at the base of the cilium. Inversin induces the degradation of cytoplasmic but not the membrane form of Dvl. In a ciliated cell (A), both the canonical and noncanonical pathways are operative and the strength of the canonical pathway (A right) is thought to be influenced by the noncanonical Wnt pathway (A, left). In the absence of cilia (B), the model would suggest that noncanonical pathway is unable to efficiently antagonize the activity of the canonical.</div></div>
