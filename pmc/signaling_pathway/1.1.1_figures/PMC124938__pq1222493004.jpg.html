(C) ALV-mediated expression of c-AKT also improves PGC survival when c-Kit signaling is activated (PGCs cultured on STO cells that express membrane-bound KL). (D) ALV-mediated expression of a dominant-negative AKT gene (AKT-T308A/S473A) in PGCs with an activated Kit signaling pathway (PGCs cultured on STO cells that express membrane-bound KL) significantly impairs survival. Data represent the mean Â± SEM of three pooled experiments each comprising triplicate cultures. *, Difference is significant at the 0.05 level.</div></div>
