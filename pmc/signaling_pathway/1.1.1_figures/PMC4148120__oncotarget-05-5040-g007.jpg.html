Scheme of the MEK inhibitor induced crosstalk mechanism.  From: The MAPK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> as an apoptosis enhancer in melanoma. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>A</b>: In absence of MEK inhibitor, BRAFV600E activation leads to the ERK1/2-dependent induction of SPRED genes, which block RAS signaling downstream of RTKs in melanoma cells. This results in low PI3K pathway activity. When cells are exposed to genotoxic stress, PUMA is induced and cells undergo apoptosis. <b>B</b>: Application of MEK inhibitor abolishes the expression of SPRED1 and SPRED2 and thereby relieves the negative feedback on RTK signaling. As a result, the PI3K pathway is activated. This prevents the induction of the apoptosis promoter PUMA in response to genotoxic stress and allows enhanced survival and protection from apoptosis.</div></div>
