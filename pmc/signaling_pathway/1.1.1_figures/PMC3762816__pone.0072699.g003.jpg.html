The cutoff P-value was set at &lt;0.00095. Common KEGG pathways shared between the two analyses are shown in the same color. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway showed that several down-regulated miRNAs could converge on the same putative gene targets (C). The predicted miRNA targets are highlighted in yellow.</div></div>
