Wnt signaling enrichment was demonstrated in human and mouse tumors associated with cAMP/PKA activation. Up-regulation of WNT3, WNT3A, WNT7 and WISP2 induces the activation of the β-catenin-dependent signaling (canonical pathway). Binding of Wnt ligands to the frizzled, LRP5, and LRP6 receptors inhibits the degradation of β-catenin cytoplasmic complex and leads to nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. CTNNB1 mutations in adrenal tumors also promote β-catenin stabilization. miR-449 is one of the highest down-regulated microRNAs in PPNAD and regulates WISP2 expression.
