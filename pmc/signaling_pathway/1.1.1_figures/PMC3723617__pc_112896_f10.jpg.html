ABA levels peak during the ST and QU phases of the salt response, but lower levels present during the RE and HO phases promote growth recovery. Based on experiments using tissue-specific suppression of ABA signaling, the inferred site of ABA in growth regulation is the END/PER tissue layers; however, regulation of gene transcription appears to occur through signaling in all tissue layers. JA levels are predicted to rise during the RE and HO phases, which are when the jai3-1 mutant has an effect on growth rates and when JA-associated transcriptional programs are induced during the salt response. GA and BR signaling is coregulated with peak levels occurring under nonstress conditions. Based on the expression pattern of GA and BR-associated transcriptional targets and dynamic changes in fluorescent-based reporters of pathway activity, we infer that GA and BR signaling recovers during the RE and HO phases of the salt stress response. Reestablishment of pathway activity is necessary to promote growth recovery.</div></div>
