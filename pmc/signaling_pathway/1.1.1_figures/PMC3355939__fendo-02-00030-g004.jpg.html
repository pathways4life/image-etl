From: ERK, Akt, and STAT5 are Differentially Activated by the Two Growth Hormone Receptor Subtypes of a Teleost Fish (Oncorhynchus Mykiss). </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Model of differential activation of signaling pathways by growth hormone receptor (GHR) subtypes</b>. JAK2 activation is essential for propagation of signaling from both GHR1 and GHR2 to the ERK, PI3K/Akt, and STAT5 pathways (details of pathway elements are omitted for simplicity). Cross-talk occurs between the ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways, possibly through Akt activation of c-Raf in the ERK pathway.</div></div>
