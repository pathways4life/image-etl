(<b>D</b>) Cell signaling proteins relating to the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway were evaluated in lung tissue by Western blotting analysis. (<b>E</b>) Expression and phosphorylation of signaling proteins relating to NF-κB transcription factor were evaluated in lung tissue by Western blotting. (<b>F</b>) Cell signaling proteins relating to the AKT signaling pathway were evaluated by Western blot. β-actin was used as a loading control. Data are shown as mean ± SEM of n=3 mice per group and are representative of three independent experiments. *P&lt;0.05; **P&lt;0.01; ***P&lt;0.001; one-way ANOVA (Tukey’s post hoc).<b>Abbreviations:</b> ANOVA, analysis of variance; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; IL, interleukin; Kp, Klebsiella pneumoniae; SEM, standard error of the mean; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; p, phosphorylation.</div></div>
