Although the canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways primarily activate the RelA/p50 and RelB/p52 dimers, respectively, all NF-κB members can be activated by either pathway or both. In fact, the RelA/p50 dimers may be sequestered in the cytoplasm by p100 and can be activated through p100 processing. On the other hand, NF-κB dimers containing p52 may be sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκBα and can be activated through IκBα degradation. Furthermore, activation of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway can be induced through inducible degradation of IκBβ, IκBε and p105, a process similar to the inducible IκBα degradation, although their degradation dynamics can be different.</div></div>
