An activation of Wnt signaling by addition of Wnt3a-CM could induce GSH generation; in contrast, overexpression of Wnt inhibitor DKK1 reduced GSH levels. <b>(B)</b> Impact of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on GSH production of RAW264.7 cells exposed to oxidative stress H2O2 (500 μmol/L) or LPS (100 ng/mL) stimulation for 6 h. The Wnt signaling could increase intracellular reduced GSH concentration in cells stressed by H2O2 and LPS. Compared to a control-CM treated cells, *: p &lt; 0.05, **: p &lt; 0.01.
