(A) IFN-responsive gene expression was determined by microarray analysis from the RNA of vaccinated ferrets at day 1 postvaccination (red, upregulation; blue, downregulation) and plotted by heat map. (B) Schematic created from the gene expression profiling data obtained at day 1 postimmunization by IPA. (Top) IPA canonical pathway of IFN signaling using Q-PCR data from the 2007 vaccine study and microarray data from the 2008 vaccine study from ferrets with CpG-mediated immunization. (Bottom) IFN signaling pathway activated by PEG-IFN-adjuvanted vaccination by using the microarray data of the 2008 vaccine study (red, upregulation). (C) Gene expression heat map of molecules involved in Ras signaling at day 1 postvaccination (top) (red, upregulation) and IPA modeling of JAK/STAT pathway-mediated Ras signaling using the microarray data from the whole-blood RNA of ferrets given PEG-IFN-mediated immunization at day 1 postvaccination (bottom) (red, upregulation).</div></div>
