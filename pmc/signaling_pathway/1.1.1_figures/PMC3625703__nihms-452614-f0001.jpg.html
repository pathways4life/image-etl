Endocytosis of receptors can produce functional desensitization of cellular responsiveness by physically removing receptors from access to extracellular ligands, and preventing access to plasma membrane-delimited signaling mediators. Recycling of internalized receptors can function, conversely, to resensitize cellular responsiveness. Trafficking of internalized receptors via the MVB/lysosome pathway causes a prolonged attenuation of cellular responsiveness by promoting proteolytic downregulation of receptors.</div></div>
