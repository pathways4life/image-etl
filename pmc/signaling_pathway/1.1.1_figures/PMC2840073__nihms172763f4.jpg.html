These cells were treated with or without 60µm H2O2 for 30min, 2h, 24h, 48h, and 72h as indicated in the panels. 100µg of total protein were loaded in each lane. Actin was included as an internal control for protein loading. The antibodies used against the different signaling mediators are indicated in the panels.</div></div>
