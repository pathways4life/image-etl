From: Non Linear Programming (NLP) Formulation for Quantitative Modeling of Protein Signal Transduction Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Generic pathway is represented as a signed directed graph, also refers as PKN. Green nodes refer to different cytokines (ligands) where the signaling process initiates; Red nodes refer to inhibitors present in the in-silico dataset; Grey nodes refer to measured proteins; White nodes refer to latent species, i.e. proteins whose activation state is not measured. (B) In-silico signaling data under combinatorial treatment with stimuli (TGFα, TNFα, no-treatment) and inhibitors (mek12i, pi3ki, no-inhibitor). Each subplot shows the average activation level within 30 minutes upon stimulation [37]. Red background refers to model-prediction mismatches (C) Optimized pathway, grey arrows refer to reactions with limited activity (zik) (caused by a parameters being close to 0). The opacity of each edge corresponds to the activity (zik) of the corresponding reaction. (D) In silico signaling dataset and fitness error after the optimization procedure. Decrease in the red background color shows the optimized model is in accordance to the signaling dataset. (E) Optimized transfer functions presented in C.</div></div>
