(A) Whole-mount ISH showing a down-regulated distal expression of Ihh in Ror2W749X/W749X mutant hand plates at E13.5 (arrows) that recovered concomitant with the differentiation of the digit tip at E14.5 (arrows). (B) Down-regulation of the IHH pathway in distal mesenchyme shown by whole-mount and section ISH for the IHH targets Gli1, Ptc1, and Runx2. (C) Ror2W749X line crossed to the canonical WNT reporter line Axin2LacZ, demonstrating ectopic activation of the canonical WNT pathway in Ror2W749X/W749X mice. LacZ staining on cryosections shows elevated/ectopic signal in the mutant in distal mesenchyme (arrows) and also in the distal-most condensation (arrowheads). Boxed areas are shown as magnifications. (D) Micromass cultures of E12.5 hand plates derived from Ror2W749X/W749X/Axin2LacZ embryos showing increased LacZ activity in cultures derived from mutant embryos. Right: Histomorphometrical quantification; error bars represent SEs from three independent experiments. (E) Schematic representation of pathway network regulating digit outgrowth in WT and its perturbation in the IhhE95K/E95K and the Ror2W749X/W749X mutants leading to impaired distal elongation of the digit condensations in the BDA1 and BDB1 phenotypes. AER–FGF signaling maintains undifferentiated mesenchymal cells (yellow). BMP/pSMAD1/5/8 signaling in the PFR (green) mediates distal outgrowth of the phalangeal condensation by controlling commitment of mesenchymal cells (arrow) to the condensation. IHH promotes distal outgrowth by enhancing chondrogenic cell commitment, potentially via induction of mesenchymal BMPs. Canonical WNT factors emanating from the ectoderm (red) induce β-catenin signaling in the mesenchyme, which inhibits BMP/pSMAD1/5/8 signaling in the PFR, thus limiting distal growth. The β-catenin signaling in the mesenchyme is negatively regulated by ROR2 (strong expression domain of ROR2 in condensing distal mesenchyme is highlighted in blue). In BDA1, the IHHE95K protein interferes with normal IHH signaling in distal mesenchyme, subsequently leading to a down-regulation of the BMP pathway in the PFR. In BDB1, the expression of a truncated ROR2 molecule leads to an up-regulation of WNT/β-catenin signaling in the mesenchyme concomitant with a down-regulation of Ihh expression and pathway activation, both converging on a drastic down-regulation of BMP/pSMAD1/5/8 signaling in the PFR. m, metacarpal; p1, condensation of phalanx 1; p2/3, unseparated primordium of phalanges 2 and 3.</div></div>
