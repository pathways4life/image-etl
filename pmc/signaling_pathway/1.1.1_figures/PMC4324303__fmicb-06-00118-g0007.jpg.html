A schematic representation of the MAPK pathways involved in arsenic signaling is depicted. As (V) triggers phosphorylation of both, HOG and CWI pathways. As (V) signaling requires Ssk1 suggesting that signal comes from outside the cell. Hog1 and Mkc1 phosphorylation may mediate transcription of genes involved in its detoxification or tolerance. As (III) triggers Hog1 phosphorylation and therefore, HOG pathway may control the transcription of genes involved in As (III) detoxification. As (III) signaling is independent of Ssk1 and others elements involves in Cek1 phosphorylation (Sho1, Opy2, and Msb2) but requires Ssk2 and Pbs2. The As (III) signaling may enter through an unknown element (represented as a question mark) or may enter the cells triggering Hog1 phosphorylation avoiding the three components system (Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1).</div></div>
