From: Targeting the Hedgehog <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> in cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Different models of Hedgehog pathway signaling. (A) Type I ligand-independent cancers harbor inactivating mutations in Patched 1 protein (PTCH) or activating mutations in Smoothened (SMO) leading to constitutive activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway even in the absence of the Hh ligand. (B) Type II ligand-dependent autocrine cancers both produce and respond to the Hh ligand leading to support tumor growth and survival. (C) Type III ligand-dependent paracrine cancers secrete the Hh ligand which is received by the stromal cells leading to pathway activation in the stroma. The stroma in turn feeds back various signals such as IGF, Wnt, VEGF to the tumor tissue leading to its growth or survival. (D) Type IIIb reverse paracrine tumors receive Hh secreted from the stroma leading to pathway activation in the tumor cells and upregulation of survival signals. (E) Cancer stem cells (CSCs): Hh signaling occurs only in the self-renewing CSCs, from the Hh ligand produced either by the CSCs or by the stroma. CSC will give rise to more Hh pathway dependent CSCs or possibly may differentiate into Hh-pathway negative tumor cells comprising the bulk of the tumor.
