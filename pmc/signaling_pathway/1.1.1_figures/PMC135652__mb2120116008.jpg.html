From: Drosophila PDZ-GEF, a Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor for Rap1 GTPase, Reveals a Novel Upstream Regulatory Mechanism in the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model showing the role of dPDZ-GEF in the MAPK pathway. Various extracellular signals instigate the MAPK-related signaling cascade. Three GEFs, i.e., Sos, dC3G, and the newly discovered dPDZ-GEF, are involved in this pathway. dPDZ-GEF is the first genetically revealed GEF that is specific for Rap1. The dPDZ-GEF/Rap1 component shares the effector signaling pathway with the Sos/Ras component, and there are likely other effectors yet to be found. In this complex network, dPDZ-GEF controls cell fate and survival as an upstream regulatory component.</div></div>
