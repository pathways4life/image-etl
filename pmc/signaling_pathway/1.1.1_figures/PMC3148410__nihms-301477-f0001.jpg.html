It is unknown if CLF1 is secreted in the absence of its partners. CLF1/CLC has been found to signal via the tripartite receptor complex of CNTFRa, LIFRÎ², and gp130. CLF1/p28 was also found to bind IL-6Ra complexed with gp130 and WSX-1. Engagement of these receptors leads to downstream signaling events via the JAK/STAT pathway (particularly STAT3), MEK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT. The full range of cells that are potentially responsive to CLF1 stimulation is unknown. The effect of CLF1 on these cells also remains unknown.</div></div>
