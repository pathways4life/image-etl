Only one common pathway, the “Development_WNT signaling pathway. Part 2”, was identified in the top 10 significant pathways between the two models. Bars quantify the –log (p-value) indicating the enrichment of the individual pathways identified. False discovery rate (FDR) is calculated for all identified pathways and a cutoff of FDR &lt; 0.05 is set to define pathways as significant. Asterisks denote significant pathways shown.</div></div>
