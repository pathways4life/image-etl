A simplified schematic of NFκB signaling pathways highlighting regulatory proteins commonly targeted by viruses [1,2,13]. HTLV-1 Tax targets the pathway at several points. (<b>a</b>) Tax leads to the activation of receptor-associated kinases that signal through the NFκB pathway [16,17]. (<b>b</b>) Tax directly binds to IKKγ (NEMO) which leads to constitutive phosphorylation and degradation of the NFκB repressor IκB [15]. (<b>c</b>) Tax activates and recruits IKKα to p100 stimulating phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and processing to p52 leading to nuclear translocation [19]. (<b>d</b>) Tax alters binding or recognition of a variety of transcription factors and DNA binding proteins increasing the number of genes regulated by the NFκB pathway [18].</div></div>
