The HepG2 cells were transfected with various plasmids provided by PathDetect Cis-/Trans-Reporting Systems. In the experimental group, cells were treated with 40 μg mL−1 EASR for 48 h. And the control group was cultured without EASR treatment. The signaling pathway activities were determined by luciferase reporter assay. EASR inhibited the activity of p53 pathway significantly (P &lt; .05). The data are presented as means ± SD (n = 3). *P &lt; .05 as compared with the control group.</div></div>
