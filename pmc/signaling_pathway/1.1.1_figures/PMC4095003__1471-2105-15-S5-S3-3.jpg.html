Panel A. Junction tree of the mTOR signaling pathway (using graphite R package and database KEGG). The top ranked time-dependent paths identified in timeClip step 2 are highlighted using the wheel of time visualization. Panel B. KEGG representation of mTOR signaling pathway. Genes are colored according to the paths in panel A. Panel C. Enlargement of the wheels of time representative of the main block of mTOR signaling pathway: from t0 to t27 (clock-wise) every slice of the pie is colored according to the value of the clique first PC (green means no activation; red means activation).</div></div>
