When ligands including Delta-like and Jagged families from signaling cells bind to Notch receptor in signaling receiving cells, NICD is cleaved by the Î³-secretase enzyme complex. The NICD translocates into the nucleus and associates with CBF1 and others to activate target genes including Hes family members.</div></div>
