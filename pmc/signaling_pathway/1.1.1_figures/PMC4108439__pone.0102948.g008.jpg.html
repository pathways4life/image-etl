From: PGE2 Promotes Apoptosis Induced by Cytokine Deprivation through EP3 Receptor and Induces Bim in Mouse Mast Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Withdrawal of cytokines results in activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway due to imbalance between Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein family members and BH3 only pro-apoptotic proteins. Intrinsic apoptotic pathway in mast cells is upregulated by PGE2 via EP3 receptor and Ca2+-CaMII-ERK1/2 pathway. While Erk 1/2 mediated phosphorylation of BimEL and Bim L immediately after PGE2 stimulation and this leads to ubiquination and degradation of these isoforms, Erk also induces expression of c-Jun, a potent upregulator of Bim expression. Final outcome of Erk regulation of Bim is a balance between Bim degradation after its phosphorylation and increase in its expression due to c-Jun. Data presented here support view that increase expression of Bim and proapoptotic action of EP3-Ca2+-CamKII â€“Erk1/2 pathway is prevalent in mast cells in presence of PGE2 and during cytokine withdrawal.</div></div>
