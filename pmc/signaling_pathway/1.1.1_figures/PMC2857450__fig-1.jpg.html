From: Potent Inhibition of Thyroid Cancer Cells by the MEK Inhibitor PD0325901 and Its Potentiation by Suppression of the PI3K and NF-?B Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PD0325901 inhibited the MAPK pathway signaling in thyroid tumor cells. Cells were lysed for Western blotting after PD0325901 treatment. The MAPK pathway activity was reflected by the level of phosphorylated ERK detected with specific antiphosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) antibody. Total ERK (t-ERK) was used for quantity control of proteins. (<b>A</b>) Concentration response of the inhibitory effects of PD0325901 on MAPK pathway in two B-type RAF (BRAF) mutation–harboring thyroid cancer cell lines KAT5 and DRO. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of PD0325901 for 2 hours. (<b>B</b>) Time course of the inhibitory effects of PD0325901 on MAPK pathway in KAT5 and DRO cells. Cells were treated with 0.1 μM PD0325901 for the indicated times. (<b>C</b>) Inhibitory effects of PD0325901 on MAPK pathway in various thyroid tumor cells. Cells were treated with 0.1 μM PD0325901 (+) or vehicle DMSO (−) for 24 hours.</div></div>
