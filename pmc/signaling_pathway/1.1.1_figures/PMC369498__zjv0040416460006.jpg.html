From: Selective Induction of Th2-Attracting Chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 in Human B Cells by Latent Membrane Protein 1 of Epstein-Barr Virus. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Effects of various signaling inhibitors on the expression of chemokine genes in EBV-immortalized B cells and BJAB-LMP1. EBV-immortalized B cells (A) or BJAB-LMP1 cells (B) were treated for 12 h with or without PD98059 (the inhibitor of the MEK/ERK pathway) at 30 μM, SB202190 (the inhibitor of the p38/ATF2 pathway) at 10 μM, JNK inhibitor (the inhibitor of the JNK/AP-1 pathway) at 30 μM, JAK3 inhibitor (the inhibitor of the JAK3/STAT pathway) at 30 μM, AG490 (the inhibitor of the JAK2/STAT pathway) at 20 μM, and BAY11-7082 (the inhibitor of the TRAF/NF-κB pathway) at 5 μM. The concentrations of the inhibitors used were carefully chosen as optimal based on preliminary experiments. Total RNA was prepared, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR was carried out for TARC/CCL17, MDC/CCL22, I-309/CCL1, MEC/CCL28, MIP-1α/CCL3, MIP-1β/CCL4, and RANTES/CCL5. For details, see Materials and Methods. The data are shown as means plus standard errors of the mean from three separate experiments.</div></div>
