Known signaling pathways: such as Tight junction signaling (WNT, P&lt;1.49E-2) and CREB signaling (SHH, P&lt;1.70E-4) were identified in our analysis as well as an abundance of neuronal pathways in non-WNT medulloblastomas.(b) Cytoscape BINGO analysis of the significant Gene Ontologies (GO) targeted by alternative splicing in Group 3 tumors, after subtracting events present in the normal cerebella, identifies neuronal pathways targeting axonogenesis and glutamatergic synaptic transmission.</div></div>
