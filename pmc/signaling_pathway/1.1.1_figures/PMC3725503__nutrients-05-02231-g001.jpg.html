From: The Role of Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Complexes <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in the Immune Responses. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Network of the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Figure 1 shows diagram summarizing the inputs and outputs of mTOR signaling network. mTORC1 integrates multiple inputs from signaling pathways including insulin, growth factors, energy, stress, mitogens, and amino acids. Additionally PI3K-mTOR also receives signals from the immune microenvironment such as T Cell Receptors (TCR), and co-stimulatory molecules CD28 (Cluster of Differentiation 28), as well as interleukins. mTORC2 complex activates Akt by phosphorylating it on serine 473, and indirectly activates mTORC1, which in turns phosphorylates its effector S6K on threonine 389.</div></div>
