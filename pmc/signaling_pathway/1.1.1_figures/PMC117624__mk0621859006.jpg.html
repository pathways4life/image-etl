Dissection  of the MAPK signaling pathway. Serum starved COS-1 cells grown in  100-mm dishes were incubated with W-13 (10 μg/ml) for 60 min, and the  last 15 min with the indicated concentrations of EGF, at 37°C.  Lysates with equal amount of protein were electrophoresed and the  stimulation of EGFR-phosphotyrosine (RC-20) (A), the Ras activation  (Ras-GTP) assessed by GST-RBD pull down (B), and the MEK activation (C)  were analyzed by Western blotting.</div></div>
