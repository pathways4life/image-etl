In this work, we have investigated the contribution of Cdc42 paralogs to morphogenesis and thermotolerance. Based on data presented here, as well as previously published work, we propose a pathway in which Ras1 signals through multiple Rho-GTPases: Cdc42, Cdc420, Rac1, and Rac2; with Cdc42 and Rac1 playing the major roles, and Cdc420, and possibly Rac2, playing minor roles. Rac1 primarily is required for hyphal morphogenesis, and may act through Ste20 and Pak1 to organize the actin cytoskeleton during cytokinesis. Cdc42, and to a lesser extent Cdc420, organize the septins during cytokinesis, and play a role in actin organization during growth under stress conditions. We additionally propose the existence of multiple as yet uncharacterized GEFs, which may provide specificity to Ras1 Rho-GTPase-mediated signaling.</div></div>
