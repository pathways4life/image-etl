From: Regulation of Cancer Stem Cells by Cytokine Networks: Attacking Cancers Inflammatory Roots. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Regulation of cancer stem cells by inflammatory cytokine networks. Binding of IL-6-IL-6R complex to gp130 and IL-8 to CXCR1/2 activates NF-κB pathway via Stat3 and Akt signaling. IL-6 and IL-8 production by NF-κB generates a positive feedback loop which maintains constitutive pathway activation. Inhibition of pathway components by pharmacologic agents is illustrated.</div></div>
