From: Cross-platform expression profiling demonstrates that SV40 small tumor antigen activates Notch, Hedgehog, and Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in human cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Impact of SV40 ST on the Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog Pathways. Schematics of the Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog pathways are shown. Genes with significantly increased mRNA's in HEK-TERST cells compared to HEK-TERV cells are shown in red, while genes significantly decreased are shown in green. Sets of downstream targets of the Wnt pathway are grouped in boxes, as are sets of c-myc downstream targets. Activation of the Hedgehog pathway due to increased HIP, SMO, and GLI2 levels results in increased Wnt ligand expression. Activation of Wnt signaling increases c-myc, activating and repressing multiple downstream target genes. Wnt pathway activation also feeds back to activate expression of Notch ligands such as DLL1.</div></div>
