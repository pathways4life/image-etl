(A)</b> TLR4 and MyD88 protein expression in microglia was significantly lower in the curcumin-treated group than in the vehicle-treated group at 24 hours after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. <b>(B)</b> NF-κB p65 and p-IκB-α protein expression in microglia was also significantly lower in the curcumin-treated group than in the vehicle-treated group at 24 hours following LPS stimulation. In contrast, IκB-α protein expression was significantly higher in the curcumin-treated group than in the vehicle-treated group after LPS stimulation. Values (mean ± SD) are representative of three independent experiments. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01.</div></div>
