Other ABA-insensitive signaling mutants (abi1-1, abi2-1) do not exhibit the gin phenotype, suggesting distinct ABA signaling pathway for Glc signaling and the vegetative stress response. The glucose insensitive (gin) phenotype is mimicked by ethylene precursor treatment of wild-type plants and is also displayed in constitutive ethylene biosynthesis (eto1) and constitutive ethylene signaling (ctr1) mutants, whereas the ethylene-insensitive mutants etr1-1, ein2, ein3 as well as mkk9 exhibit glucose hypersensitivity (glo phenotypes). Glucose and ethylene signaling converge on the regulation of the ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) TF to differentially modulate its protein stability. The bifurcate and antagonistic CTR1 and MKK9 pathways are both critical in determining ethylene-signaling specificity through two MAPK phosphorylation sites with opposite effects on EIN3 stability. In addition, HXK-signaling positively and negatively interacts with auxin and cytokinin signaling, respectively. More details on hormone and sugar interactions are presented in the text.</div></div>
