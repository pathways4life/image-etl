Pathway 1: The nuclear-initiated estrogen signaling mediated through classical ERs leads to the transcriptional changes in estrogen-responsive genes with or without EREs. Pathway 2: The membrane initiated estrogen signaling leads to diverse cytoplasmic effects, including the regulation of membrane-based ion channels, regulation of second messenger systems, and modification of transcription factors or other membrane receptors. Pathway 3: Estrogen can also exert antioxidant effects in an ER-independent manner. Pathway 4: Ligand-independent genomic actions. Growth factors (GF) activate protein-kinase cascades, leading to phosphorylation (P) and activation of nuclear ERs at EREs.</div></div>
