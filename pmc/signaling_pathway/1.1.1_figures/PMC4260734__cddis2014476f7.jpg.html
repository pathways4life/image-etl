Podocytes display a highly organized cytoskeleton, which is important for the complex structure of the cells. Actin dynamics or the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton impairs the complex structure of these cells, leading to a loss of physiological functions. The disruption of the actin cytoskeleton activates Hippo signaling by activating LATS kinase, which changes the predominant nuclear YAP signal to a more cytoplasmic distribution. Reactivation of Hippo signaling by activating LATS kinase is sufficient to induce apoptosis in podocytes, but not in HEK293T cells</div></div>
