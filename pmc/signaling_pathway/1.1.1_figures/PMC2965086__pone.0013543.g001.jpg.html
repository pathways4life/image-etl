Median Fluorescence Intensities (MFI) were calculated for leukemic blast cells in each condition and used to compute metrics for Relative Expression of surface expression markers and Basal, Fold and Total measurements of signaling as described in Results. Definitions of metrics used to analyze surface marker expression, signaling data, and apoptosis readouts are shown (i.e. Basal  =  log2(UnmodulatedMFI/AutofluorescenceMFI).</div></div>
