The correlation was positive between the curve of lactation and lactose yield with ‘Galactose metabolism’ (r = 0.87, P = 0.02 and r = 0.81, P = 0.09, respectively) and ‘Lactose biosynthetic process’ (r = 0.82, P = 0.05 and r = 0.88, P = 0.05, respectively). The correlation was positive (r = 0.56) but not significant (P = 0.32) between milk fat yield and ‘PPAR signaling’.</div></div>
