(A)</b> Shows the coordinates of proteins from the proteomics dataset (see as Figure 2F), where proteins from the leukemia tail are highlighted. In contrast to the microarray data, leukemia features are clearly represented in the proteome dataset. <b>(B)</b> The leukocyte extravasation signaling pathway is significantly enriched in analysis resulting from integration of leukemia features from all platforms. Colors indicate features from different datasets. <b>(C)</b> Melanocyte development and pigmentation signaling pathway was enriched in melanoma genes.</div></div>
