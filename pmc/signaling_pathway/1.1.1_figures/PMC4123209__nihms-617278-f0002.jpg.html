From: A tale of two cytokines: IL-17 and IL-22 in asthma and infection. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">IL-17 and IL-22 bind to transmembrane heterodimeric cell surface receptors to induce cellular signaling pathways. Specifically, IL-17A or IL-17F binds to the IL-17RA and IL-17RC, respectively as homodimers or heterodimers. The binding of IL-17 to its receptor leads to the recruitment of adaptor protein and E3 ligase, Act1. Scaffold proteins TRAF6 and TAK1 interact with Act1 to activate NF-ÎºB expression, which leads to subsequent induction of proinflammatory genes. IL-17 signaling through its receptor also induces ERK, p38, and JNK activation via Act1 binding with TRAF2 and TRAF5. Further, this MAP kinase activation can induce downstream signaling to activate AP-1 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP). Receptor signaling of IL-22 through its heterodimer receptor of IL-10R2 and IL-22R1 induces phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Tyk2, which activate the transcription factor STATs. In some cases, MAP kinases (ERK, p38, and JNK) are also activated through a distinct pathway following IL-22R activation. IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) acts as a soluble antagonist.</div></div>
