In the presence of Wnt signaling, adipogenesis is inhibited through Î²-catenin-mediated expression of Wnt target genes. Wnt pathway antagonists, including frizzled-related proteins (sFRPs), Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF-1), and Cerberus and Dickkopfs (Dkk), inhibit Wnt signaling and subsequently stimulate adipogenesis.</div></div>
