Impact of Gef on βAR-mediated regulation of cardiac transcript expression..  From: ?-Adrenergic Receptor-Dependent Alterations in Murine Cardiac Transcript Expression Are Differentially Regulated by Gefitinib In Vivo. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Stimulation of βAR leads to activation of G protein signaling to induce changes in transcript expression via classical cAMP-PKA-mediated signaling. βAR stimulation also induces the transactivation of EGFR, which alters transcript expression directly, or indirectly by antagonizing the classical βAR-cAMP-PKA pathway, effects that are blocked with Gef treatment.</div></div>
