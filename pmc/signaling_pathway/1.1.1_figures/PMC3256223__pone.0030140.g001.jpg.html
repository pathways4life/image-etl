The protein BAD-1 takes part in further three reactions that are the decay-reaction (4), phosphorylation reaction (5) and dephosphorylation reaction (6). The phosphorylated protein P-AKT (plasma membrane) catalyzes the phosphorylation reaction, in which protein BAD-1 is phosphorylated into P-BAD-1. Afterwards, the protein P-BAD-1 is then dephosphorylated; <b>C</b>: shows a simplified miRNA biogenesis, target recognition and competitive anti-miRNA effect. (1) miRNA-gene transcription; (2) miRNA translocation (from nucleus into cytoplasm); (3) miRNA-binding-target reaction; (4) miRNA binds to the miRNA inhibitor.</div></div>
