From: I-mfa Domain Proteins Interact with Axin and Affect Its Regulation of the Wnt and c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Diagram of the effects of HIC and I-mfa on Axin-mediated signaling. (A) Effects on the Wnt Pathway. (Top panel) In the absence of HIC or I-mfa, Axin binds free β-catenin or β-catenin that is released from E-cadherin and promotes phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β and β-catenin degradation. TCF- or LEF-mediated transcription is not activated. (Middle panel) In the presence of HIC, the Axin-mediated decrease in the free β-catenin level is inhibited due to effects on Axin complex formation or GSK-3β activity. Axin inhibition of β-catenin activation of TCF- or LEF-mediated transcription is decreased. (Bottom panel) In the presence of I-mfa, the Axin-mediated decrease in the free β-catenin level is inhibited, and β-catenin activation of TCF- or LEF-mediated transcription is inhibited. (B) Effects on the JNK pathway. (Top panel) In the absence of GSK-3β, Axin binds MEKK, leading to activation of the JNK pathway. (Middle panel) HIC binding to Axin does not affect the binding of GSK-3β, and the activation of JNK is decreased. (Bottom panel) I-mfa binding to Axin does not affect the binding of GSK-3β, and the activation of JNK is decreased.</div></div>
