The Wsp signaling machinery (WspA, WspB, WspD, WspE) is shown as a box with the letters C and F indicating the proteins WspC (methyltransferase) and WspF (methylesterase), respectively. The links indicate activations (arrows) or repressions (bar ends). In the absence of a stimulatory ligand, the signaling machinery oscillates between an active (solid) and inactive (open) state, depending on the combined (and opposing) effects of WspC and WspF, which cause the cell to achieve a particular balance between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated WspR. (Left) The signaling state of the wild-type Wsp pathway that spends time in both active (upward diagonal lines) and inactive (downward diagonal lines) states. Mutations in wspF that reduce protein function, even just slightly, destroy the capacity of the pathway to fluctuate between activity states, producing instead a steady-state output (a constant level of phosphorylated WspR). The precise strength of the output signal depends on the degree to which WspF function is reduced and is maximal when WspF function is completely eliminated (right). Different mutations are predicted to tune the pathway to different output levels (middle panels).</div></div>
