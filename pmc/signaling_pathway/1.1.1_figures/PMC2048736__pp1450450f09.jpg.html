From: Dual Regulation Role of GH3.5 in Salicylic Acid and Auxin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> during Arabidopsis-Pseudomonas syringae Interaction. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Function model of GH3.5 in Arabidopsis-P. syringae interactions. A, In the compatible interaction, GH3.5 is activated to modulate the auxin pathway resulting in enhanced disease susceptibility through increasing IAA biosynthesis and derepressing auxin signaling. IAA also induces GH3.5 to enlarge those processes. In addition, GH3.5 might also function as an IAA-amido synthetase to regulate IAA homeostasis. B, In the compatible/incompatible interactions, GH3.5 positively modulates the SA pathway to enhance plant defense response through elevating SA biosynthesis, activating SA-induced genes, WRKYs, and basal defense-related genes. Feedback regulation of GH3.5 by SA amplifies those effects. In this case, GH3.5 might also synthesize SA-Asp with unknown function during the interactions.</div></div>
