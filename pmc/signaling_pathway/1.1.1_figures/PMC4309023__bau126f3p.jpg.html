(<b>A</b>) INOH-based ontology uses the ontology or hierarchical formats to annotate the curated signal transductions and metabolic pathways in BioPAX and INOH formats. ‘MoleculeRole’, ‘Process’, ‘Location’ and ‘Event’ are four types of ontological terminologies, which are used by this database. Under the ‘Event’ category, all the pathways are annotated and each pathway is then further categorized into several sub-categories according to their molecular functions. For example, the Hedgehog pathway is divided into four sub-categories: ‘Negative regulation of Hedgehog pathway’, ‘Secretory Hedgehog pathway’, ‘general Hedgehog pathway’ and ‘Regulation of Hedgehog pathway’. For each category, there is also a unique ID number present, which classifies a pathway according to its various molecular functions. (<b>B</b>) ‘Bioportal: Pathway Ontology’ (http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PW) forms the ontological tree by using the conceptual terminologies: ‘classic metabolic pathway’, ‘disease pathway’, ‘drug pathway’, ‘regulatory pathway’ and ‘Signaling pathway’. The signaling pathway is further divided into various categories, such as ‘calcium mediated’, ‘adhesion based’, ‘G-protein mediated’ and ‘Developmental process’. Hedgehog and Notch pathways are kept under the ‘signaling pathways pertinent to development’ category. Furthermore, a unique ID is provided for each pathway with its sub-categories in the ontology tree. Here, the altered pathways for each pathway is also considered and kept under different classification, which in turn helps to distinguish the normal and its altered counterpart. For example, in case of Notch signaling pathway, it is classified as the possible alteration of Notch pathway by several factors such as by promoters, target genes and macromolecules and each altered pathway are assigned with different ID numbers.</div></div>
