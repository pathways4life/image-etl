Engagement of the TCR in more effective CTLs results in rapid and robust proximal TCR signaling, as opposed to the slower proximal signaling that is induced in less effective CTLs. In contrast to weak signaling, strong signaling is initiated by a greater number of activated signaling proteins per microcluster and leads to rapid downstream signaling kinetics, as determined by measurement of the rate of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (10). Increasing the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ results in the activation of downstream signaling that regulates the velocity of granule movement to the MTOC. In contrast, translocation of the MTOC is independent of Ca2+ and is mediated by DAG-dependent signaling (21, 34). This signaling dichotomy accounts for the mechanism that controls the two pathways of granule delivery to the secretory domain. A faster signaling kinetics stimulates the swift movement of granules toward the MTOC, and granules become concentrated near the MTOC before its polarization. The MTOC then directly delivers granules to the secretory domain, which is the short path of delivery. Slower signaling kinetics results in delayed recruitment of granules, which move along microtubules to the periphery of the synapse and then loop through the pSMAC to fuse at the outer edge of the secretory domain; this is the longer pathway. Both pathways can operate in a single cell, and the balance between them is regulated by the kinetics of TCR-mediated signaling.
