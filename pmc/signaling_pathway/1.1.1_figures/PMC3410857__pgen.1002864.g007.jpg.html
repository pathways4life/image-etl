Model for mir-71 function in AWC asymmetry..  From: The MicroRNA mir-71 Inhibits Calcium <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> by Targeting the TIR-1/Sarm1 Adaptor Protein to Control Stochastic L/R Neuronal Asymmetry in C. elegans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In the default AWCOFF cell, tir-1 acts in a calcium-regulated kinase signaling pathway to represses the expression of the AWCON marker str-2. Both nsy-4 and nsy-5 act to increase the level of mature mir-71, which results in downregulation of tir-1 expression and subsequent de-repression of str-2 gene expression in the cell that becomes AWCON. Gray is used to indicate the gene product is less active or inactive.</div></div>
