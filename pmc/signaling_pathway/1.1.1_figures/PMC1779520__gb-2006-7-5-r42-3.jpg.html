Major components from three pathways, the PI3K pathway, the JAK/STAT pathway and the MAP kinase pathway are indicated. Class I genes with consistent expression profiles across all treatments in our experiments are indicated by red (up-regulated) or green (down-regulated) at their appropriate position in each of the pathways.</div></div>
