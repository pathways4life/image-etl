This signaling network can be thought of as a highly coarse-grained representation of the full apoptotic signaling network. The following rate constants were used: 2 × 10−4 (for the type 1 pathway); 1.0, 10−7 and 10−1 (for the type 2 pathway). X0 measures the strength of an apoptotic stimulus (varied in Figure 9). Initial numbers for all other the molecules (X1, X2, X3) were assumed to be 100. </div></div>
