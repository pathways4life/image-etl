In the classic pathway, any signaling through the Na+/K+-ATPase requires inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase pumping activity, which in turn is accompanied by changes in cytosolic [Na+] and [K+]. As discussed in the text, some authors feel that the caveolar Na+/K+-ATPase may be more sensitive to CTS in terms of enzymatic function. The increases in [Na+] and decreases in [K+] then induce an increase in cytosolic [Ca2+], which, in turn, activates a variety of pathways that have combinations of genomic and nongenomic effects. In contrast, the signaling pathway involves the association of Src with the Na+/K+-ATPase in a caveolar domain. Binding of the CTS to the Na+/K+-ATPase activates Src, which, in turn, transactivates the EGFR and phospholipase C (PLC). This leads to a cascade that involves generation of ROS, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) through activation of its mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), activation of PI(3)K, stimulation of endocytosis and activation of Akt as well as activation of protein kinase C. This signaling construct proposes that these steps induce increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] and induce the combinations of genomic and nongenomic effects. Note that whereas both the classic and signaling pathways allow for intervention at the level of CTS binding to the Na+/K+-ATPase [(a), immunoneutralization or pharmacological neutralization], the signaling pathway presents a number of potential targets such as (b) interference with Src activation and EGFR transactivation, (c) PLC activation, (d) MEK activation, (e) ROS generation or scavenging, or (f) PI(3)K activation. Modulation of the signaling pathways at the level of PKC (g), ERK, and Akt might also be possible.</div></div>
