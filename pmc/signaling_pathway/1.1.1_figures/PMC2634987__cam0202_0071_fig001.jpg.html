From: The EGFR-GEP100-Arf6 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> in breast cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The GEP100-Arf6 pathway to invasion. The Arf6 pathway, which involves its activation by GEP100 and employs the AMAP1-mediated signalsome for its downstream signaling constitutes a robust and central pathway for the induction of the invasion and metastasis of some breast cancer cells. GEP100 associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR for its activation. Therefore, activation of EGFR is required for the activation of this pathway. This pathway also appears to perturb the formation and maintenance of E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion.</div></div>
