From: Time series gene expression profiling and temporal regulatory <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> analysis of BMP6 induced osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Gene expression fold changes induced by BMP6 in three representative significant KEGG pathways</b>. Each pathway shown is at its most perturbed time point: (a) TGF-beta signaling pathway at 8h; (b) Focal adhesion at 10d; (c) MAPK signaling pathway at 24h. Gene expression level fold changes are standardized over the standard deviation of fold changes for all genes. The standardized fold changes are visualized by using KEGGanim web tool [56]. Note that one KEGG node may correspond to multiple closely related genes with the same function. Relevant other pathways are magnified locally for better view. Gene names are intentionally omitted by KEGGanim for clear view of the gene expression changes in pseudo-color.</div></div>
