From: Negative feedback regulation of Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> by G??-mediated reduction of Dishevelled. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model for a negative feedback mechanism of Wnt signal transduction by Gβγ signaling. Left panel: In the presence of Wnt, Dishevelled (Dvl) and Axin (for canonical Wnt signaling) are translocated to membrane-bound Frizzled and LRP, respectively, and initiate downstream signaling. Released Gα subunits from Gβγ may then synergistically enhance canonical Wnt signaling. During this time if LRP-bound Axin binds the Gβγ subunit and blocks the downstream signaling of Gβγ then Dishevelled will not be degraded and signaling will continue. Middle panel: Upon further Wnt signaling LRP-bound Axin is degraded which leads to release of Gβγ subunits from Axin. Right panel: The released Gβγ subunits interact with Dishevelled, which lead to its destruction via a signaling pathway including PLC, Ca+2 and PKC. The activation of the Gβγ signaling cascade leads to degradation of Dishevelled in lysosomes and thereby turns off Wnt signaling.</div></div>
