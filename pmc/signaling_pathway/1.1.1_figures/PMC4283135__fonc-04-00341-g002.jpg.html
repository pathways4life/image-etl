Notch signaling has been shown to be modulated on multiple levels in glioma cells and is linked upstream and downstream to other tumorigenic pathways. Its expression is induced by Ras and Akt, while Notch itself induces expression of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) via p53 (indirectly; hence dashed arrow) and pro-migratory glycoprotein tenascin C (TNC). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and HIF-2α compete for NICD binding. The Notch inhibitor HIF-2α is displaced by HIF-1α under hypoxic conditions. Further, several proteins modulate the Notch pathway at the level of NICD. Examples are Numb, which promotes Notch degradation via ubiquitin ligases such as FBW7 or Itch, or Numb4d7 and ligand of Notch protein X (LNX), which stimulate Notch signaling.</div></div>
