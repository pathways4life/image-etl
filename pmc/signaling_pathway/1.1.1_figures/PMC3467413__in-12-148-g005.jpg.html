(A and B) Serum levels of IFN-β (A) and TNF (B) in B6 mice treated with LPS (50 mg/kg) plus various doses of STO609 or vehicle (DMSO) were measured by ELISA (n=4). B6 mice were treated various doses of STO609 twice (18 and 0.5 hours) before LPS infusion. Mice were sacrificed 2 hours after LPS administration and sera were collected from each mouse for ELISA. Data are presented as mean±SEM. *p&lt;0.05 compared with LPS plus vehicle-treated mice.</div></div>
