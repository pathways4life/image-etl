In the chemical network representation of a KEGG metabolic pathway <b>(B)</b> the nodes represent biochemical compounds and edges represent chemical reactions. These chemical reactions are performed by enzymes which are proteins encoded by genes. Hence, in contrast with the signaling pathways in which genes are associated with nodes, in a metabolic pathways genes are associated with edges. This is the main reason most methods developed for signaling pathways cannot be applied directly to metabolic pathways. In an NCI-PID signaling pathway <b>(C)</b> nodes fall in two categories: component nodes representing biomolecular components, or process nodes representing biochemical reactions or biological processes. Edges connect two biomolecular components through a biochemical reaction or a biological process. Process nodes can have 3 states: positive regulation, negative regulation, or “involved in.” (see http://pid.nci.nih.gov/userguide/network_maps.shtml for details). In a protein-protein interaction network <b>(D)</b> nodes represent proteins and the interactions among them represent physical binding. These interactions can be inferred from two-hybrid assays and they may be either undirected (top), or directed from the bait protein to the prey protein (bottom). In the Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX) <b>(E)</b> nodes are physical entities and edges are conversions. BioPAX entities can represent complexes, DNA, proteins, RNA, small molecules, DNA regions or RNA regions. Conversions can represent biochemical reactions complex assembly or degradation, transport or transport with biochemical reaction. This model is very generic and increasingly flexible. It provides a standard for pathway information to be available in machine readable format, therefore easy to use for pathway analysis and to exchange between pathway databases (see http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3-documentation.pdf for details).</div></div>
