(A) In the vasculogenesis by bone marrow-derived cells, endothelial progenitor cells migrate from the bone marrow, home to peripheral organs, and participate in the postnatal neovascularization. (B) JAK-STAT pathway in cardiac resident stem/progenitor cells may contribute to neovascularlization by inducing the endothelial differentiation. IL-6-type cytokines, secreted from myocardium, stimulate gp130-JAK-STAT-Pim-1 signaling pathway in cardiac resident stem/progenitor cells, and induce the endothelial differentiation. The newly differentiated endothelial cells may participate in vessel formation without homing process, designated as “in situ vasculogenesis.”</div></div>
