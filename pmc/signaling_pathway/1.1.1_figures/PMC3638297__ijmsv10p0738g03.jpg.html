(A) Lef1 mRNA expression level measured by realtime PCR (*p&lt;0.05). (B) The cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of Lef1 and β-catenin in the bulge stem cells treated with DP or not. (C) Immunofluorescence analysis on the location of Lef1 in those cells. Scale bars: 20μm. (D) The transcriptional activity of Wnt signaling was determined by luciferase reporter assay. (*p&lt;0.05). Data shown here are representative for three experiments.</div></div>
