Meanwhile, there are considerable interactions between JA/ethylene- and SA-dependent pathways in systemic acquired resistance. In edr1 mutant, ethylene potentiates SA-mediated PR-1 gene expression. In the absence of CPR5 and CPR6, the ethylene pathway can also activate SA-dependent PR-1 gene expression independent of NPR1 to promote systemic acquired resistance. In the ssi1 mutant, the JA/ethylene-dependent PDF1.2 gene is constitutively expressed. Moreover, the ethylene pathway is also required for the rhizobacteria-mediated induced systemic resistance, which is independent of SA and pathogenesis-related gene activation. Ethylene signaling acts downstream of the JA pathway but upstream of NPR1 in ISR activation. Plants that lack ISR1 fail to develop ISR and display ethylene insensitivity. Arrows indicate positive regulation, and open blocks indicate negative regulation.</div></div>
