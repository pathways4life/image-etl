From: Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>: the good and the bad. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) When Wnt signaling is “turned off”, cytoplasmic β-catenin is degraded by the Axin complex consisting of APC, GSK3 and CKIα. Within this complex, CKIα and GSK3 phosphorylate β-catenin, phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by β-Trcp and degraded via the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Wnt protein can be inhibited by sFRPs, and LRP5/6 can be inhibited by DKK1. (B) When Wnt signaling is “turned on”, Wnt protein binds its receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6 and stimulates LRP5/6 phosphorylation with the help of Dishevelled. Phosphorylated LRP5/6 recruits Axin to the membrane and disrupts the Axin complex. β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and enters nucleus, where it binds TCF/LEF and co-activators, such as pygopus, legless and CBP/p300, and activates gene expression.</div></div>
