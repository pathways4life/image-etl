Intergenic Network..  From: Genome Wide Expression Analysis Suggests Perturbation of Vascular Homeostasis during High Altitude Pulmonary Edema. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The figure represents an integrated network of multiple pathways interacting through common gene products. Specific sub-networks (gene associations within individual pathways) constituting the integrated network are highlighted in Supplementary Figure S3 (A-R). The major sub-network pathways include regulation of actin cytoskeleton, calcium signaling, MAPK pathway, immune cell signaling, cell-cell communication, VEGF signaling amongst others. The network shown was extracted from the list of differentially expressed genes utilizing ‘Pathway Miner’. Relationships between the genes (nodes connected by edges) suggest co-occurrence in a biological pathway. Weight of a specific edge is a relative representation of the number of pathways in which the associating nodes (gene products) co-occur in the KEGG pathway resource. The nodes are labeled by gene names and colored based on the respective fold changes for specific genes in the original data set.</div></div>
