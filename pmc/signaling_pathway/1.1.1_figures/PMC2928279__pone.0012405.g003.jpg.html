From: Distinct Patterns of DNA Damage Response and Apoptosis Correlate with Jak/Stat and PI3Kinase Response Profiles in Human Acute Myelogenous Leukemia. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of NR samples (unfilled red squares) compared to CR samples (filled blue circles) for Jak/Stat and PI3K signaling. The metrics used in the analysis were “basal”, “fold” and “total”. (A) Basal signaling: basal metric values for p-Stat1, p-Stat3, p-Stat5 and p-Stat6 were chosen to represent Jak/Stat pathway signaling, while the basal values for p-Erk, p-S6 and p-Akt were chosen to represent the PI3K pathway. The first principal component for the Jak/Stat pathway explained 85% of the variance while the one for the PI3K pathway explained 71% of the variance. (B) Induced signaling: the metrics used in the analysis were “fold” and “total” metric for the same intra-cellular readouts used for the PCA of basal signaling. The percentage of variance explained by the first principal component for induced Jak/Stat signaling was 66% and for induced PI3K signaling it was 46%. The PCA reveals a heterogeneity of profiles for NR samples when treated with modulators which is not seen in the PCA of untreated samples in their basal state.</div></div>
