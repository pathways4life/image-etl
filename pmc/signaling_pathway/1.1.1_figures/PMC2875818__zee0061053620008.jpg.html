The results described are consistent with the model in which LH activates the LH receptor and adenylyl cyclase, which leads to an increase in cAMP. As a result, there is an increase in the phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3B. At the same time, there is a reduction in the activation of AMPK. These events reduce the activity of the TSC, allowing MTOR to phosphorylate components of the translational apparatus, S6K1 and 4EBP1. Treatment with rapamycin inhibits MTOR activation without altering progesterone secretion. Treatment with AICAR activates AMPK, inhibits MTOR phosphorylation of S6K1, and inhibits progesterone secretion. The results suggest that LH uses a unique pathway to activate MTOR signaling in bovine luteal cells, but the rapamycin-sensitive MTOR signaling pathway does not contribute to corpus luteum progesterone synthesis.</div></div>
