Hippo <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and some of its connections with other pathways.  From: Integration of intercellular <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> through the Hippo <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The schematic depicts regulatory some of connections within the Hippo pathway, and between Hippo signaling and other pathways discussed in the text. The Drosophila names of pathway components are used, and the schematic is over-simplified in that many Hippo signaling pathway components are not shown. Interactions with other pathways depicted include 1) Within the nucleus, Yki/Yap/Taz promotes the expression of ligands for other signaling pathways. 2) Yki/Yap/Taz interacts with Smad proteins (Mad) and β-catenin, which are transcription factors of TGF-β and Wnt pathways. When Yki/Yap/Taz is cytoplasmic this interaction inhibits transcriptional activation by these pathways, but when its nuclear they cooperate to promote transcription of downstream genes. 3) Fj and Ds expression are regulated by the Notch, Dpp, and Wg signlaing pathways in the Drosophila wing, at least some of this regulation is mediated through Vg (not shown). 4) Wounding, apoptosis, or infection (“stress”) can activate the Jnk pathway, which can lead to Yki activation.</div></div>
