From: Macrophage Migration and Its Regulation by CSF-1. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A schematic of signaling pathways activated by the Rho GTPases in macrophages. Generic GEFs and GAPs are designated as upstream regulators of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho activity. Downstream signaling molecules specifically labeled in the schematic are those that are described in the text. Signaling pathway outcomes are depicted for actin cytoskeleton responses only. Regulation of adhesion by Rho GTPases in macrophages is not shown as the signaling pathways are not yet elucidated.</div></div>
