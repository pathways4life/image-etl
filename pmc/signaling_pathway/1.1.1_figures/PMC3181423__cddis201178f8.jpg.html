TNFR1-induced activation of the classical NFÎºB pathway results in concomitant upregulation of FLIPL/S and CD95. Although upregulation of FLIPL/S antagonizes TRAIL-induced apoptosis, this effect is overcompensated in context of CD95L-induced signaling by the strong increase in CD95 expression</div></div>
