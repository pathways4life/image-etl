Without SMO activation, Gli proteins are processed with Su(Fu), GSK3Î², PKA, and CKI into a repressor form (Gli-R), which disable the Hh signaling pathway. <b>B</b>, In the presence of Hh, it binds to PTCH. The binding can be repressed by HIP and supported by Cdo, Gas1 and Boc. Upon binding, the Hh/PTCH complex becomes internalized in endosomes and later degraded. Without inhibition from PTCH, SMO becomes activated and facilitated Gli activation n (GliA), which stimulates Hh target gene expression.</div></div>
