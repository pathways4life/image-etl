Simplified schematic of the proposed relationship between BMPR2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>, canonical TGFβ <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>, and caveolae.  From: HERITABLE FORMS OF PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Caveolae are receptor-rich regions of the plasma membrane, populated by multiple receptor types including BMPR2 and TGFβ receptors. A delicate balance between BMPR2 pathway and TGFβ pathway signaling modulates pro-proliferative and apoptotic forces. A BMPR2 mutation, or reduced wild-type BMPR2 gene expression, may perturb this balance—perturbation may promote PAH pathogenesis. Disruption of caveolae structure or function could also disrupt cell signaling by reducing receptor density.</div></div>
