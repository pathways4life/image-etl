The uric acid-induced increase in NF-κB transcriptional activity was reversed by benzbromarone. (<b>B</b>) IκBα phosphorylation, detected by Western blotting, increased in a time-dependent manner in Min6 cells stimulated with 5 mg/dL uric acid at 60 mins. (<b>C</b>) Benzbromarone (50 µmol/L) reversed the uric acid-induced increase in IκB phosphorylation.
