Western blot analyses were done to assess activation of the PI3-kinase→Akt→mTOR pathway (A), MAP kinase signaling (B), RAS pathway activation (C), and expression of Myc and Cyclin D1 (D). Western blots were performed using total protein extracts prepared from dorsolateral prostate or prostate tumors from the indicated genotypes. Western Blots were quantified using ImageJ.</div></div>
