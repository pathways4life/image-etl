From: A new cytosolic DNA-recognition <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> for DNA-induced inflammatory responses. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Cytosolic DNA recognition pathway for IL-1β production. Upon recognition of DNA, AIM2 interacts with ASC, a common adaptor of the inflammasome, leading to the assembly of an inflammasome and the cleavage of caspase-1, which induces the processing of pro-IL-1β and the secretion of IL-1β. Roth et al.4 demonstrated a new cytosolic DNA sensing pathway that was able to induce IL-1β. The presence of DNA or a DNA virus in the cytosol induces the formation of dsDNA–Rad50–CARD9 signaling complexes, which control NF-κB activation and the transcription of the gene encoding pro-IL-1β. AIM2, absent in melanoma 2; CARD9, caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9.</div></div>
