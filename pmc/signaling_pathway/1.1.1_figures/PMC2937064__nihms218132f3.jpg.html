Stimulation of the CD28/PI-3K/AKT pathway and thereby inhibition of the FOXO signaling axis is a unique mechanism developed to separate T cells from the major glucose metabolic system. This would confer a great evolutionary advantage on the organism, because the signal that triggers T-cell co-stimulation by CD28 also triggers the energy utilization of T cells. However, life-long over-utilization of this pathway is associated with acceleration of T-cell senescence, including loss of CD28 expression and development of AICD-resistant T cells.</div></div>
