ABA receptors include nucleocytoplasmic PYR/PYL/RCARs (PYLs), most likely the plastid-localized Mg-chelatase H subunit (CHLH/GUN5/ABAR) and plasma membraneâ€“localized GPCR type G-proteins (GPCRs). A core signaling pathway (black dotted rectangle enlarged in left) consists of PYLs, PP2Cs, SnRK2s, and downstream substrates, which control gene expression (long ABA signaling pathway) and stomatal closure (short ABA signaling pathway). Dimeric PYLs cannot bind to PP2Cs in the absence of ABA; thus, SnRK2s activity is inhibited by PP2Cs. Nevertheless, a subfamily of monomeric PYLs exhibits constitutive inhibitory activity on PP2Cs. In the presence of ABA, PYLs contact and inhibit PP2Cs, leading to the activation of SnRK2s through autophosphorylation. Then, the activated SnRK2 targets ABA-responsive element binding factors (such as bZIP) to regulate gene expression in the nucleus and the cation channel SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1 (SLAC1) and POTASSIUM CHANNEL IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1 (KAT1) to cause stomatal closure in cytoplasm. The solid line with double-headed arrows indicates the equilibrium between dimeric PYLs and monomeric PYLs. The solid line with an arrow indicates direct positive interactions. The solid line with a bar indicates repression.</div></div>
