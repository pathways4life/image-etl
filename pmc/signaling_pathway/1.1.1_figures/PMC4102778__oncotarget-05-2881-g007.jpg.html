From: GSK-3 as potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The Hh pathway normally inhibits the membrane spanning PTCH1 GPCR receptor which is indicated by a squiggly red line crossing the membrane 14 times. PTCH1 normally inhibits SMO which is indicated by a purple squiggly line which crosses the membrane 7 times. SMO is then activated in the primary cilium and serves to inhibit SUFU which is indicated by a red octagon. SUFU normally inhibits the GLI1 and GLI2 transcriptions factors which are indicated in blue diamonds. The Rab23 GTPase may aid in the nuclear translocation of the transcription factors and is indicated by a purple oval. In contrast, GLI3 is activated by SUFU and may serve as a transcriptional repressor and is regulated by GSK-3. It is indicated in a black diamond. One of the genes that are regulated by GLI signaling is IGF2. Dysregulation of Hh signaling pathway occurs in certain cancers. Resistance to Hh pathway inhibitors may result from mutations in the pathways which lead to increased pathway expression and autocrine IGF2 expression. This figure is presented to give the reader an idea of the negative regulation of the Hh pathway by various components</div></div>
