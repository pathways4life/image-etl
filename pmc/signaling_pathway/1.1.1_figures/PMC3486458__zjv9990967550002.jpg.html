(A and B) LC3-II, PCV2 Cap expression, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), and total ERK1/2 in PK-15 cells infected with PCV2 or mock infected (Ctrl) for 36 h. Their ratios to β-actin were normalized to mock infection, set at 1.0. (C and D) Effect of UO126 treatment on endogenous LC3-II, p-ERK1/2, and total ERK1/2 of PK-15 cells infected with PCV2 for 36 h. Their ratios to β-actin were normalized to mock infection, set at 1.0. (E) Formation of autophagosomes, shown as green punctae in PK-15/EGFP-LC3 cells that were treated as described in panel C. (F) Average number of punctae in each cell from 60 to 80 cells in each treatment. (G and H) PK-15 cells were mock treated (NS) or treated with ERK1/2-specific siRNA for 24 h. The cells were then further infected with PCV2 or mock infected for 36 h, and p-ERK and LC3-II ratios to β-actin were normalized to mock-infected cells, set at 1.0. (I) Formation of autophagosomes, shown as green punctae in PK-15/EGFP-LC3 cells that were treated as described in panel G. (J) Average number of punctae in each cell from 60 to 80 cells in each treatment.</div></div>
