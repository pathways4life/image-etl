Measurement of the fractional reduction of proteins in the pathway from NADPH through TrxR1, Trx-1, and redox factor-1 (Ref-1) to NF-ÎºB p50 subunit under control conditions showed that the pathway is kinetically limited in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. In the nuclear compartment, the characteristics suggested that electron transfer was blocked between Trx-1 and Ref-1. Under conditions where NADPH supply was limited by removal of Glc and Gln from the culture media, the cytoplasmic pathway was selectively oxidized while the nuclear pathway showed a loss of the kinetic limitation. The results show that metabolic conditions determine sites of rate limitation, supporting the concept that rate control in redox pathways is important in cell signaling and regulation. Scheme is based upon data of Go et al. (57).</div></div>
