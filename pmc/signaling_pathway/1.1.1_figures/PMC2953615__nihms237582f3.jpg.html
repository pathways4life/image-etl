One model is that the cilium is positioned next to the nucleus such that components of signaling cascades like the Shh pathway (inset) may be concentrated within the cilium in order to faithfully relay messages. Thus, the cilium acts as a concentrator of signaling components, or a signaling hub. Background images are immunostaining within renal tubules or cultured hippocampal neurons.</div></div>
