Phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by the E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase β-TrCP and targeted for proteosome degradation. Wnt signaling inactivates the destruction complex, as a result β-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors and co-activators such as CBP/p300, to stimulate transcription. In the absence of Wnt signaling, DNA-bound TCFs interact with transcriptional co-repressors such as, Tle/Groucho to keep target genes turned off.</div></div>
