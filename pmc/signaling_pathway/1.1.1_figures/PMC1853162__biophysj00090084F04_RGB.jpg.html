(A) The simplest such network, herein referred to as the “basic architecture”, shown with activation and decay rate constants. Component x1 is common to pathways X and Y. This network cannot achieve specificity and fidelity. (B–F) Elaborations to the basic architecture that are found in nature and have been proposed to promote specificity. (B) Combinatorial signaling with an independent, parallel input provided by pathway Z. (C) Combinatorial signaling via the branching and reintegration of pathway X. (D) Cross-pathway inhibition. (E) Compartmentalization. (F) The action of a scaffold protein.</div></div>
