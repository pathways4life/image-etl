The oncogenic Ras-transformed MCF-10A cells (10A/H-Ras and 10A/K-Ras) were transiently transfected with control, IFN-β or IFNAR1 siRNA. Cell lysates were collected 72 hrs post-transfection and immunoblotted with anti-ISG15 and anti-IFNAR1 antibodies. C. The PI3K inhibitor reduces ISG15 expression in oncogenic Ras-transformed cells. 10A/H-Ras and 10A/K-Ras cells were treated with 20 µM LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, for 3 days. Lysates with equal protein amount were immunoblotted with anti-ISG15 antibodies (L: LY294002). D. The NF-κB inhibitor reduces ISG15 expression in oncogenic Ras-transformed cells. 10A/H-Ras and 10A/K-Ras cells were seeded and cultured overnight. Cells were then treated with or without 40 µM Bay 11-7085, an NF-κB inhibitor, for 24 hrs. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-ISG15, phospho-IκBα, and IκBα antibodies.</div></div>
