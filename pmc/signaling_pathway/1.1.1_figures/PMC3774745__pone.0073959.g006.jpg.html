The P values are expresses as logarithmic scale. B) Graphical representation of the Notch signaling pathway map (gene ontology enrichment, P=2.913e-4).C) Graphical representation of the WNT5 signaling pathway (gene ontology enrichment, P=3.256e-3).Genes with gains are underlined in red and genes with losses in blue.
