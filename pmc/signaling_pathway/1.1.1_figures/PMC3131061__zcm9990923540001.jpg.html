Immune receptor signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation can be grouped into four categories on the basis of the surface receptors involved: members of the TIR superfamily (IL-1Rs/TLRs), antigen receptors (TCR and BCR), members of the TNF-R superfamily (TNF-Rs), and RANK, VEGFR3, and EDAR. The two proteins of the TIR signaling pathway (MyD88 and IRAK-4) and the two proteins of the NF-κB signaling pathway (NEMO and IκBα) responsible for primary immunodeficiencies are shown.</div></div>
