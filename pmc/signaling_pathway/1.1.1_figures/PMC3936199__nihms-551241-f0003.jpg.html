Regulation of hepcidin by BMP/SMAD, inflammatory and hypoxia/erythropoietic <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in the liver.  From: Iron homeostasis in the liver. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Three major pathways are critical for regulating basal and stimuli-induced hepcidin expression. Binding of iron containing Tf to Tfr1 causes a dissociation of Tfr1-High FE (HFE) complex and an interaction of HFE with Tfr2. Increased stabilization of Tfr2 increases BMP6 mediated phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/ 8 and recruitment of SMAD 1/5/8 and SMAD4 to the hepcidin proximal promoter. BMP/SMAD signaling is the major pathway by which hepcidin expression is coordinated to meet systemic iron requirements. Activation of hepcidin by inflammation is thought to act independently of the BMP/SMAD pathway. The best-studied mechanism is via the pro-inflammatory mediator IL-6. Binding of IL-6 to its receptor IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) initiates activation of the JAK-STAT3 pathway. STAT3 binds directly to the proximal promoter to increase hepcidin expression. Hypoxia and erythropoiesis are inhibitors of hepcidin expression and these are the least understood pathways by which hepcidin expression is regulated. Hypoxia and erythropoiesis have been shown to inhibit hepcidin expression via direct binding of HIF to the proximal promoter, an EPO-EPO receptor (EPOR) mediated decrease in C/EBPÎ± expression, and through increase in an unknown erythroid derived factor which signals through an undefined pathway.</div></div>
