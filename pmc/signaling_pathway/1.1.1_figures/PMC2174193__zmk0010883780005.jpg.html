From: Large-Scale Analysis of Yeast Filamentous Growth by Systematic Gene Disruption and Overexpression. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway and filamentous growth. (A) Overview of the pathway and relevant proteins. (B) Phenotypic analysis of RTG pathway mutants. Gene deletion and rho0 mutants were analyzed for filamentous growth phenotypes as indicated. Colony morphology was assessed on low-nitrogen solid growth medium supplemented with 1% butanol; cell morphology was assessed in rich liquid medium supplemented with 1% butanol. (C) The RTG pathway inhibits filamentous growth. Retrograde signaling acts as part of the mechanism by which mitochondrial dysfunction is transduced into a signal affecting filamentous growth.</div></div>
