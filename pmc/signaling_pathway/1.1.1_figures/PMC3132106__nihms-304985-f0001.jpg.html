This simplified representation of the known extracellular interactions governing Wnt signaling depicts how secreted Wnt ligands can interact with receptors that trigger either the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway or other pathways like the Wnt/Ca pathway that act via other signaling mediators. As indicated in the figure, activation of Wnt/Ca receptors can inhibit the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. The portrayal of RYK reflects data suggesting that this receptor may be able to activate both the Wnt/beta-catenin as well as beta-catenin-independent Wnt signaling cascades (17). Extracellular levels of Wnt ligand are titrated by binding to sFRPs, which exhibit homology to the cysteine-rich Wnt-binding domains of the FZD receptor. The secreted protein DKK antagonizes Wnt signaling via binding to the canonical Wnt co-receptor LRP5/6.</div></div>
