From: Why should we care about fly tumors?. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Figure 1.</b> The combined action of EGFR and JAK-STAT signaling results in tumor progression. (<b>A</b>) Epithelial growth in tissues with normal apico-basal cell polarity is controlled by the balanced activity of EGFR, JAK-STAT and other signaling pathways. Negative regulators such as Socs36E control pathway activity by modulating signaling output. (<b>B</b>) When EGFR is over activated (shown in bold), the epithelium proliferates excessively without necessarily causing metastasis. (<b>C</b>) Over proliferation and metastasis are promoted by the combined misregulation of EGFR and high JAK-STAT expression when the signaling balance is broken by the downregulation of Socs36E by bantam miRNA expression or by JNK mediated JAK-STAT activation.</div></div>
