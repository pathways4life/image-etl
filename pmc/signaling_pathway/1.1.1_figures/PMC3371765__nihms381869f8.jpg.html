Left, Î³-secretase inhibitor DAPT decreases the amounts of Notch1C, inhibits Hrt/Hes, increases the amounts of Hath1 and CDX2 and probably leads to goblet cells production. Right, inhibition of the pathway by DCA (an unknown mechanism) decreases the total amounts of Notch receptors, thereby reducing the amounts of Notch1C, inhibits production of Hes/Hrt, increases amounts of Hath1 and CDX2, and may lead to goblet cells. An arrow indicates activation and a blocked arrow indicates inhibition. Broken arrow, suggested processes.</div></div>
