From: Role of VPO1, a newly identified heme-containing peroxidase, in ox-LDL induced endothelial cell apoptosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The proposed pathway of VPO1 mediation of ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell apoptosis. Ox-LDL up-regulates the expression of NADPH oxidase subunit gp91phox and consequently increases intracellular ROS production and VPO1 expression as well as HOCl production. There is a positive feedback loop between VPO1/HOCl and the NADPH oxidase/ROS pathway, which in turn activates the p38 MAPK/caspase-3-dependent signaling pathway to mediate ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell apoptosis.</div></div>
