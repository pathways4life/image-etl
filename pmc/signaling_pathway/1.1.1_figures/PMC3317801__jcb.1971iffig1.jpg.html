Cells arrest in early mitosis when signaling through the pathway is disrupted, either by blocking membrane traffic or by mutating pathway components like protein kinase C (right, compared with wild-type yeast, center). The researchers think that the pathway may allow cells to control their size by coordinating cell growth and division.PHOTO COURTESY OF VU THAI</div></div>
