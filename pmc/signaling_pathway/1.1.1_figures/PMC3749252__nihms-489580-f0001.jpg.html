Error bars represent standard deviation (n=4 independent experiments). 22-NHC inhibits Hh pathway activation by Shh but does not significantly change the EC50 of Shh.(c) As in (b) but Hh signaling was activated by various concentrations of the 20-OHC analog, 20-OHC-Pent. 22-NHC inhibits Hh pathway activation by 20-OHC-Pent, without significantly changing the EC50.(d) As in (b) but Hh signaling was activated by various concentrations of SAG. 22-NHC does not inhibit Hh pathway activation by SAG but decreases the EC50 for SAG.(e) Smo−/− MEFs were rescued by stable expression of mSmo or the constitutively active mutant mSmoM2. Transcription of the Hh target gene, Gli1, was measured by Q-PCR in the absence or presence of 22-NHC (20 μM) or SANT1 (2 μM). Error bars indicate standard deviation (n=3 independent experiments). 22-NHC does not inhibit SmoM2.(f) Shh Light II cells were stimulated with Shh, in the presence of increasing amounts of 22-NHC, with the addition of cylopamine or cyclopamine-KAAD. Hh pathway activity was assayed as in (b)(g) As in (f) but with addition of SANT1, GDC0449 or itraconazole.</div></div>
