Models for the mechanisms of cross-talk between receptor tyrosine kinase/growth factor and rapid estradiol-induced activation of ERK1/2.

Pathway 1 represents G-protein-like transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) proposed to occur via GPR30 or ERα induction of MMP-mediated heprin-bound EGF (HB-EGF) shedding; Pathway 2 shows the mechanism proposed to involve direct interaction of ERα with Shc which acts to couple the activated ER to the ras/ERK pathway; Pathway 3 is a cascade involving the interaction of the ER with the adaptor protein PELP/MNAR 1, or directly interacting with c-Src to stimulate c-Src kinase, which in turn activates Ras to link the activated ER to ERK-MAPK pathway; Pathway 4 shows the G-protein and Src-kinase dependent, EGF-receptor independent pathway operative in cerebellar granule cells. The site of inhibition for specific antagonists used to elucidate the pathway of rapid cerebellar signaling are indicted. The dotted arrow indicates the identified rapid intracellular estrogen signaling pathway that stimulates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity in granule cells. This phosphatase pathway is independent of Gαi-signaling and is also PKA independent. PP2A activation is required, along with rapid ERK-activation, for estrogen to induce calpain-mediated cell death in granule cell precursors. Key protein kinase activation phosphorylation sites are indicated with a red P. The PI3K pathway is included to illustrate that EGF-receptor activation in granule cells activates both the ERK &amp; PI3K pathways, but estrogen only stimulates ERK-signaling.</div></div>
