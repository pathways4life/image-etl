(A) The main chain of the filamentation pathway (KEGG Database), (B) PathFinder output for the Sho1-Tec1 pair (75% recall, 17% precision). For (A), the dashed interactions indicate that these interactions do not exists in the database. For (B), the proteins that were not on the main chain of the pathway were not colored, whereas the proteins on the main chain are colored grey. Proteins that are part of other pathways are colored with different colors.</div></div>
