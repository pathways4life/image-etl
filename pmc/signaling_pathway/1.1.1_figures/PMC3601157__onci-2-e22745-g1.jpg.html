The activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in melanoma cells by oncogenic BRAFV600E leads to the production of interleukin 1 (IL-1)α/β. Tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) respond to IL-1 by upregulating an immunomodulatory transcriptional program resulting in the production of COX-2, PD-1 ligands and chemokines, as well as in the amplification of IL-1 signaling. Collectively, these factors and signaling circuitries suppress cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) functions.</div></div>
