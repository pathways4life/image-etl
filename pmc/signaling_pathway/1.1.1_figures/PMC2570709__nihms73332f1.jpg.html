The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is referred to as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway since it can regulate β-catenin. All Wnt signaling pathways are initiated by interaction of Wnt proteins with Frizzled (FZD) receptors. Once Wnt protein binds to the FZD receptor and the co-receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)-5/6, this is followed by recruitment of Dishevelled. Dishevelled can inhibit glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3β) activity. The non-canonical or calcium Wnt signaling pathway has two intracellular signaling cascades that consist of the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway and the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. In the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, Wnt protein binds to FZD receptors on the cell surface resulting in several cellular processes that can involve stimulation of heterotrimeric G proteins and increased intracellular Ca2+ release. Yet, the distinction between these pathways is sometimes not distinct and may involve non-canonical pathways, such as Wnt5a, that antagonize canonical pathways by leading to the degradation of β-catenin.Lef: Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor; Tcf: T cell factor.</div></div>
