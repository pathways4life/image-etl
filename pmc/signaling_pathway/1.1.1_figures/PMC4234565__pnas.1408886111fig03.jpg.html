(A) Expression of the deltex gene Dtx4 in all organs superimposed. (B) Example of pathway componentsâ€™ timing reflecting function: expression profiles from the heart, for Vegfa and its two receptors Kdr and Flt1. Black arrows highlight times at which Flt1 and Kdr are anti-phased. (C) Example of systemic pathway orchestration segregating in time and space: expression profile of Igf1 in the liver, compared with its downstream target Pik3 in several organs. (D) Example of widespread pathway component synchronization within the same space (organ): expression profiles from the kidney for multiple signaling receptors that activate the PIK3-AKT-MTOR pathway.</div></div>
