From: NPHP4, a cilia-associated protein, negatively regulates the Hippo <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>NPHP4 antagonizes the Hippo pathway.</b> Active Hippo signaling leads to phosphorylation (P) and activation of the large tumor suppressor (LATS) kinase, which in turn phosphorylates YAP at Ser-127 and TAZ at Ser-89. This creates phosphoepitopes that are rapidly engaged by 14-3-3, leading to cytoplasmic retention of YAP and TAZ and the inhibition of their transcriptional activation potential. NPHP4 abrogates the interaction of large tumor suppressor with its substrates YAP and TAZ, which abolishes 14-3-3 binding and allows for nuclear translocation of YAP and TAZ.</div></div>
