Multiple modes of crosstalk between the RAS/MAPK and insulin pathways during vulval development..  From: PTEN Negatively Regulates MAPK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> during Caenorhabditis elegans Vulval Development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Activation of LET-60 RAS in the VPCs causes phosphorylated MPK-1 to enter the nucleus where it phosphorylates transcription factors such as LIN-1 ETS, which represses 1Â° fate-specific gene expression. The insulin signaling pathway interacts with the RAS/MAPK pathway at several levels. Firstly, DAF-2 InsR activation enhances RAS/MAPK signaling by stimulating the PI3K AGE-1, which positively regulates RAS/MAPK signaling via increased PIP3 production. In addition, DAF-2 signaling activates the RAS/MAPK signaling independently of AGE-1, possibly by recruiting SEM-5 to the plasma membrane. DAF-18 PTEN inhibits RAS/MAPK signaling in two distinct manners; by dephosphorylating PIP3 and by negatively regulating MAPK activation.</div></div>
