Receptors, adaptor proteins, Smads, co-activator/co-repressor and DNA binding co-factors are targeted by E3 ubiquitin ligases for ubiquitination and degredation by the proteasome. These protein degredation pathways impart precise and specific control over the cellular response to TGF-β signaling.</div></div>
