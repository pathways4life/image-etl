There are two independent endocytic pathways, regulated by accessory protein interactions that exist to regulate TGF-β signaling: <b>A</b>.) the clathrin-mediated pathway leading to receptor recycling, and <b>B</b>.) the caveolin-mediated pathway leading to proteasomal degradation of TGF-β receptors. The TGF-βRII mutations identified in several aneurysm syndromes may contribute to the enhanced TGF-β signaling by facilitating interactions with SARA, or by diminishing association with Smad7, favoring receptor recycling and resulting in prolonged activation of TGF-β signals.</div></div>
