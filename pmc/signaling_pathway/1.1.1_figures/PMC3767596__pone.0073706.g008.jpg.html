The loss of CD9 causes the transfer of the LPS-signaling mediator CD14 from tetraspanin-enriched microdomains to lipid rafts and thereby leads to augmentation of LPS-induced inflammatory signaling in macrophages. Theophylline and dexamethasone (which activate HDACs) or statins (which inhibit the mevalonate pathway) upregulate CD9 and may reverse this cascade in inflammatory lung diseases, including COPD.</div></div>
