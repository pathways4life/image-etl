(A and B) After transfection, HEK293 cells were treated with tunicamycin (2 μg/mL) together with U0126 (10 μmol/L) (A) or EGF (200 ng/mL) (B) for the indicated time and insulin for 5 min (167 nmol/L). Then, the phosphorylated IR was analyzed. (C) HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1/pcDNA3.1-hATF6α. After 5 h, cells were refreshed and incubated with U0126 (10 μmol/L) or EGF (200 ng/mL) in serum-free DMEM for 4, 8, and 12 h without tunicamycin stimulation before 5-min insulin (167 nmol/L) stimulation. cP&lt;0.01.</div></div>
