It in turn activates the pathway to KRAS, RAF, to ultimately activate the mitogen-activated kinase, MAPK, pathway via MEK to ERK. An activating mutation in KRAS (shown in red), such as the codon 12 and 13 mutations described in low grade serous ovarian cancer, can drive downstream activation of the MAPK pathway without upstream the otherwise needed upstream stimulation by RTK. Similarly, an activating mutation in BRAF (shown in green), such as V600E</div></div>
