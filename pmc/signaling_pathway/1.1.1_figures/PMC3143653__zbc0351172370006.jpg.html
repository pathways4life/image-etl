Nine of 15 mRNAs were included in the network. Lines with arrowheads, molecule acts on a target; lines without arrowheads, binding only. Solid lines, direct interaction; dotted lines, indirect interaction. Blue background, regulated putative MEF2 targets; white background, other signaling network members.</div></div>
