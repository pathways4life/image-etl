From: Transcriptional Programs Controlling Perinatal Lung Maturation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Representation of mRNAs changed during lung maturation in KEGG Notch Signaling Pathway (map04330). Red nodes indicate mRNAs that were significantly increased, while dark green indicates decreased expression during lung maturation. Light green indicates no significant change in gene expression or data not available. (B) Genes encoding a number of key components in the Notch Signaling Pathway were expressed at significantly higher levels in A/J than in B6 mice at E18.5 (*: P&lt;0.05). Results are expressed as the means Â± SEM of 3 animals per time point.</div></div>
