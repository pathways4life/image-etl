Capillary ECs are coupled by tight and adherens junctions that limit paracellular transport between adjacent cells. Circulating large molecules are extravasated from the capillary when PVM/Ms are absent. PVM/Ms control vascular permeability by affecting the expression of tight- and adherens-junction proteins through a PEDF/PEDFR signaling pathway.</div></div>
