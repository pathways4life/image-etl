Sixty min later, the rats were treated icv with apoE (4 μg) or saline. After 30 min, hypothalami were microdissected and the protein extracted. Proteins were analyzed using Western blot with phospho-specific anti-pAkt antibody or antibody that recognizes the total Akt protein as loading control. Pretreatment with LY294002 (LY) attenuated apoE-induced Akt phosphorylation in the hypothalamus. A, representative immunoblots of pAkt and total Akt; B, quantitative analysis.
