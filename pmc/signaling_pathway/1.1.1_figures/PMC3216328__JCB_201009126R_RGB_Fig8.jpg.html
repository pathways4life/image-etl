PI(3,4)P2 that is generated via dephosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P3 by synaptojanin-2 (SJ2) may regulate invadopodia formation through the Tks5/N-WASP axis in parallel with PI(3,4,5)P3. PDK1 and Akt are activated by both PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 and act as mediators of the PI3K signaling pathway for invadopodia formation.</div></div>
