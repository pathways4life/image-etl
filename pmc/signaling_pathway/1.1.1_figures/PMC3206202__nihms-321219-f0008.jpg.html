The y-axis displays the significance score (negative log of p-value calculated using right-tailed Fisher Exact Test). The yellow threshold line that appears in the bar chart represents a p-value of 0.05. The significance threshold of pathways was set to 1.3 (derived by −log10 [P-value], whereas P≤0.05). Canonical pathways below the threshold line are not statistically significant. Beyond the threshold, the taller bars represent participation of higher number of genes in the pathway compared to shorter bars. (A) Genes induced during MIPM displaying higher statistical significance value (low p-value) or stronger association to the canonical pathways (Huntington’s disease signaling, 14-3-3 mediated signaling, GABA receptor signaling, CXCR4 signaling and axon guidance signaling) compared to genes induced during BIPM. (B) Bar chart showing the significant association of mating induced genes to the canonical pathways like neuregulin signaling, synaptic long-term potentiation, cAMP-mediated signaling, G-protein coupled receptor signaling, α-adrenergic signaling, and oxidative phosphorylation. The genes in these pathways are expressed only in during MIPM. (C) Graph showing the significant association of genes induced during BIPM with the canonical pathways like neurotrophin.TRK signaling, protein ubiquitination pathway, regulation of actin-based motiliy by Rho and PI3K/AKT signaling. Association with these pathways among genes induced during MIPM is either absent or statistically not significant.</div></div>
