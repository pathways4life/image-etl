Time course of JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation as detected by immunoblotting with anti-p-JNK and anti-p-c-Jun, respectively (Top) and the control antibodies anti-JNK and anti-c-Jun, respectively (Bottom). Cells were incubated with fXa (10 nM), TNF (5 ng/ml), or both for the indicated times. Representative data from three independent experiments are reported.</div></div>
