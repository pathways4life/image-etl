In the two-choice arena, two first-instar larvae of P. rapae were placed on each plant <b>(A)</b>. Each two-choice arena (n = 20) consisted of two 6-week-old plants of each genotype (total eight larvae per arena). After 4 days the number of caterpillars on each genotype was determined. The preference of P. rapae larvae was tested in combinations with wild-type Col-0 plants and genotypes that are affected in the MYC2-branch of the JA pathway <b>(B1–3)</b>, genotypes that are affected in the ERF-branch and/or the MYC2-branch of the JA pathway <b>(C1–5)</b>, and mutant coi1-1 plants that are completely blocked in JA signaling <b>(D1)</b>. The right panel displays which branch of the JA pathway is predominantly activated in the corresponding genotypes that are displayed in the left panel. The “0” indicates that neither of the branches of the JA pathway was activated. Displayed are the average percentages (±SE) of the distribution of the P. rapae larvae over the two genotypes (x-axis). Statistically significant differences from the 50% percentile were analyzed using a Student’s t-test. In cases of statistically significant differences (Student’s t-test; p &lt; 0.05), the preferred branch of the JA pathway is marked with a red circle. Experiments were repeated with similar results.</div></div>
