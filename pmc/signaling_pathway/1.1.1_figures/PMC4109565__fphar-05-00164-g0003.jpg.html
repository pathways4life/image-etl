In case 1, a compound shows high activity through, for example, activation of apoptosis. In case 2, three compounds are annotated to targets known to function in the same signaling pathway but each compound shows weak activity in the assay. In case 3, a compound shows strong activity in the assay acting through inhibition of general mechanisms such as transcription/translation. <b>(B)</b> While compounds in case 1 and 3 are easily captured using standard statistical thresholds, compounds in case 2 may only be rescued by examining the entire dataset and considering the target annotations in the context of biological pathway analysis. <b>(C)</b> Plot representing the aggregate effect of compounds perturbing a pathway to identify weakly active compounds (case 2). Each circle on the plot represents a pathway. The x-axis represents the aggregate effect of compounds hitting targets from the same pathway. For example, case 2 is depicted as having three compounds that individually show weak activity but are annotated as operating in the same pathway. The likelihood of getting such a score by chance, given the number of genes/proteins, is given on the y-axis (given as âˆ’log10, e.g., p = 0.01, 2). Using such an approach, relevant biological processes with subtle effects can be identified.</div></div>
