PTEN has major implication in PI3 kinase (PI3K) signal transduction pathway and negatively controls PI3K phosphorylation. PTEN is implicated in cell cycle progression and cell death control through inhibition of PI3K-Akt signal transduction pathway and in the control of cell migration and spreading through its interaction with focal adhesion kinase (FAK).</div></div>
