From: Inhibition of c-Jun-N-terminal Kinase Increases Cardiac Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor ? Expression and Fatty Acid Oxidation and Prevents Lipopolysaccharide-induced Heart Dysfunction. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Proposed model.</b> A, schematic model that explains the role of the JNK signaling pathway in the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and relevant gene expression that leads to cardiac dysfunction during sepsis. Binding of the complex that consists of LPS and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) on the TLR4 and CD14 receptors activates the JNK signaling pathway. In addition, inflammatory pathways are activated via stimulation of the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. The JNK signaling pathway leads to down-regulation of the expression of fatty acid oxidation-associated genes and eventually causes cardiac dysfunction. B, inhibition of JNK prevents sepsis-mediated down-regulation of cardiac fatty acid oxidation, thus it protects cardiac function in sepsis despite increased levels of inflammatory cytokines.</div></div>
