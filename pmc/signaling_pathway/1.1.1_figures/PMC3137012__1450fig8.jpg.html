From: Differential regulation of CIDEA and CIDEC expression by insulin via Akt1/2- and JNK2-dependent pathways in human adipocytes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Hypothesis of insulin signaling pathways associated with the regulation of CIDEA and CIDEC expression in human adipocytes. The regulation of CIDEA and CIDEC expression by insulin is mediated by PI3K signaling. However, the insulin signaling pathway involved in the regulation of CIDEA and CIDEC diverges into different pathways downstream of PI3K. Akt1/2 mediates insulin-induced downregulation of CIDEA, whereas JNK2 mediates insulin-induced upregulation of CIDEC. The insulin regulation of CIDEA and CIDEC via different signaling pathways would contribute separately to insulin-induced anti-apoptosis and lipid droplet formation in human adipocytes.</div></div>
