From: Toll-Like Receptor 4 Mediates Tolerance in Macrophages Stimulated with Toxoplasma gondii-Derived Heat Shock Protein 70 . </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Mechanism of TgHSP70 tolerance in PMs from WT mice. TgHSP70 stimulation leads to TLR2 activation and the pathway of TLR2-MyD88-IRAK4-TRAF6-IKK-mediated phosphorylation of I-κB. These signaling cascades produce NO. Simultaneously, TgHSP70-stimulated TLR4 mediates IFN-β activation that suppresses NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (18). Inhibition of these signaling cascades by IFN-β is possibly mediated by SOCS-1 (7) and limits the production of NO.</div></div>
