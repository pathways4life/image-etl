The signaling downstream from EphA2 activation by ligand engagement counteracts growth factor signaling by inhibiting activation of Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt, which contributes to the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis. <b>B.</b> In EphA2-null epithelial cells, the negative regulator of growth factor signaling is disrupted, which renders epithelial cells more susceptible to carcinogen insults leading to tumor development. <b>C.</b> With tumor progression, EphA2 can be highly upregulated whereas ephrin-A is not or downregulated, which resulting in excess of unligated EphA2. Unligated EphA2 can serve as a substrate of Akt becoming an integral component of growth factor pathway to promote tumor cell migration and invasion. At the same time, unligated EphA2 is incapable of suppressing Ras/ERK pathway.</div></div>
