Arrow indicates activating phosphorylation; line with a perpendicular line at the end indicates inhibitory phosphorylation; line with a circle at the end indicates dephosphorylation; dashed line indicates resulting outcome of signaling. Green represents components of the PI3K/AKT pathway which have been shown to be beneficial for Treg function and/or development. On the contrary, red indicates molecules with activity thought to be inhibitory for Treg function and/or development.</div></div>
