A, Western blot of total SMC extract, at different times after the addition of PDGF to cells that were not preincubated (Control) or were preincubated with 10 nm ACE for 120 min (ACE-treated). Graphs show the densitometry plots of the Western blot bands corresponding to activation of SHP2 (B) or AKT (C) by PDGF in control and ACE-treated cells. D, a longer exposure of the band corresponding to pPDGFR-β (185 kDa) shown in A. E, densitometry plot of the Western blot bands corresponding to activation of PDGFR-β.</div></div>
