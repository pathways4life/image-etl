Activation of these receptors activates several downstream signaling pathways. Among these pathways the Ras-MAPK, the P13K-Akt, mTOR and NF-κB pathways are of significance and targets of DIM. By dephosphorylating these molecules, DIM modulates downstream signaling pathways impinging on proliferation, angiogenesis and apoptosis. NF-kB pathway is inactive as a result of the binding of p50 and p65 to IκB. When IκB is phosphorylated by IKKs and degraded, p50 and p65 are set free and are translocated into the nucleus to activate a specific set of genes. This pathway has been shown to be inhibited both in vitro and in vivo by DIM. Activation of AP-1 is primarily mediated by MAPK, especially through the phosphorylation by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which leads to translocation of AP-1 and subsequent transcriptional activation of target genes</div></div>
