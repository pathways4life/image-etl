Activation of P2X7 promotes LPA formation through PLA2 or PLD, but subsequent activation of LPA1 or LPA3 does not promote IκBα degradation. Activation of P2Y6 promotes the release of intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. Purinoceptor activation alone is not sufficient for NF-κB translocation, suggesting that another FSS-activated signaling pathway (indicated by <b>?</b>) is involved in this process.</div></div>
