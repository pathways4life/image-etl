From: Dynamic Regulation of the Kv2.1 Voltage-gated Potassium Channel during Brain Ischemia through Neuroglial Interaction. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic diagram of our model. During brain ischemia, the signaling pathway shown in red takes place immediately (&lt;5 min), and then later, the left-hand pathway will also be driven to cause Kv2.1 modulation. They both ultimately induce the increase in the intracellular Ca2+ level [Ca2+]i, followed by Kv2.1 modulation (dephosphorylation, dispersion, and activation). The texts in the parentheses indicates the experimental supports of the signaling pathways. See Discussion for more detail.</div></div>
