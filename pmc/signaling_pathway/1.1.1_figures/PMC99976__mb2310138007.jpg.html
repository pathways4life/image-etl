EGL-15 activation leads to the phosphorylation of SOC-1 on tyrosine 408; this event triggers PTP-2 recruitment and/or activation. In addition, EGL-15 activates the canonical SEM-5/SOS-1/RAS/MAPK pathway. Potential targets of the SOC-1/PTP-2 cassette and/or its role in modulating activity of the RAS/MAPK cascade are indicated by dashed lines. Precisely how activation of EGL-15 triggers SOC-1 and SEM-5 to participate in EGL-15 signal transduction remains unresolved (indicated by dashed lines from the receptor).</div></div>
