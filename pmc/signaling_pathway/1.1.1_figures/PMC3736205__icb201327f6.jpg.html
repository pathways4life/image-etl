From: Host genetic background impacts modulation of the TLR4 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> by RON in tissue-associated macrophages. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Overview of the impact of the RON pathway on M1 versus M2 differentiation program in the context of TLR4 signaling. Transcript and protein levels of IFN-β and TNF-α were compiled from data presented in figures, as described in the text. The IFN-β transcript level was taken from Supplementary Figure S3A (FVB) and from Supplementary Figure S5A (C57Bl6). The TNF-α transcript level was taken from Supplementary Figure S1A (FVB) and Supplementary Figure S2A for C57Bl6 mice. The intermediate time points for TNF-α protein levels in both backgrounds were analyzed (data not shown). Protein or mRNA levels at each time point are expressed as percentage of maximal expression (100%). Optimal TNF-α expression in response to LPS in macrophages from FVB mice was highly dependent on early induction of IFN-β. In contrast, M1/Th1 predisposed macrophages from C57Bl6 mice were mostly refractory to the effects of RON on TNF-α production and IFN-β. We propose that RON signaling in macrophages from FVB mice preserves M2 differentiation in the presence of TLR4 signaling, whereas C57Bl6 macrophages maintain polarization toward M1 cells in the presence of RON signaling.</div></div>
