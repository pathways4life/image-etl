From: What's Downstream? A Set of Classroom Exercises to Help Students Understand Recessive Epistasis . </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A hypothetical yeast enzymatic pathway regulated by a hypothetical signaling pathway. (A) Enzymatic pathway alone (see text for context). A, B, and C are small molecules. Heavy arrows represent enzymatic reactions, and light arrows represent expression of the genes that encode the corresponding enzymes in the pathway. This pathway is controlled by the presence or absence of sucralose. (B) The same enzymatic pathway (lower line), intersecting with a signaling pathway (blue line) that is controlled by the presence or absence of neotame. In the signaling pathway, R, S, and T are proteins with the functions shown, encoded by Genes 3, 4, and 5 respectively. Light arrows indicate gene expression, but here, heavy arrows represent regulatory interactions: pointed arrows indicate activation, and the blunt arrow indicates inhibition. For example, in the presence of both sucralose and neotame, if the receptor R is activated by neotame binding, it activates the protein S. If S is active, it inactivates the transcription factor T, which is otherwise active and is required to activate transcription of Gene 2.</div></div>
