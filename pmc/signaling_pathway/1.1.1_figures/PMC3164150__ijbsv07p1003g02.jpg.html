From: The Link between the Metabolic Syndrome and Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The insulin receptor (IR) with its two subtypes IR-A and IR-B, the insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) and the hybrid receptors (IGF-1R/IR-A and IGF-1R/IR-B). Structurally, IR and the IGF-1R have two extracellular α-subunits and two transmembrane β-subunits that are jointed to each other by disulfide bonds. Affinity, insulin binds with high affinity to IR-A or IR-B but has low affinity for IGF-1R, while insulin has no binding to the hybrid receptors. IGF-1 binds to the IGF-1R and to the hybrid receptor IGF-1R/IR-A or IGF-1R/IR-B. IGF-2 binds to IR-A, IGF-1R or to IGF-1R/IR-A hybrid receptor. Signaling, ligand binding to insulin receptor-A or to IGF-1 receptor mediates the mitogenic signaling pathway, while ligand binding to insulin receptor-B activates metabolic signaling. Binding to the hybrid receptors, leading to mitogenic or metabolic signaling, is determined by the IR isoform that formed the hybrid receptors. Reproduced by permission of the RMMJ 54.</div></div>
