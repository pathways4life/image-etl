In air, the MAPK-cascade is repressed, the ET downstream components EIN2, EIN5 and EIN6 inhibited and EIN3 ubiquinated and degradated by 26S proteasome. In the presence of ET, the EtRs are inactivated, CTR1 is not active and the repression on the downstream pathway do not exist; thus, the ET signal is transmitted to EIN3, which accumulates in the nucleus and activates gene expression. Ub, ubiquitin.</div></div>
