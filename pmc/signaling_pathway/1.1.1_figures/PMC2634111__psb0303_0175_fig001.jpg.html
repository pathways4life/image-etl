In dormant state, high amount of ABA induces an active signaling pathway involved in dormancy maintenance. Lower ABA concentration in nondormant seeds would be associated with a higher level of ROS, presumably H2O2, which could in turn interfere with ABA and GA signaling pathways, modify redox status and induce protein carbonylation. NO may interfere with H2O2 and activate GA signaling. The size of the letters is proportional to the relative amount of the compounds (ABA, GA, H2O2).</div></div>
