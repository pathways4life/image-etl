From: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Cascades and Ethylene: <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>, Biosynthesis, or Both?. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed models for the involvement of MAPK modules in the ethylene signaling (A) or the ethylene biosynthetic pathway (B). A, Ethylene is perceived by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized ethylene receptors. In the absence of ethylene, ETR1 and ERS1 interact with and activate the Raf-like MAPKKK CTR1. CTR1 represses ethylene signaling by inhibiting the activity of the potential membrane (M)-bound Nramp ion metal transporter-like protein EIN2 and inactivating the MKK9-MPK3/6 module. Additionally, CTR1-dependent signaling, possibly through another MAPK cascade, leads to the phosphorylation of the EIN3 transcription factor on T592 and, thus, to the degradation of EIN3 via the 26S proteasome. After the binding of ethylene, the signaling through the receptor/CTR1 module is inactivated and downstream signaling events are initiated. After translocation of MKK9 from the cytosol (C) to the nucleus (N), the MKK9-MPK3/6 module phosphorylates EIN3 on T174, causing the stabilization of the protein and protecting it from 26S proteasome-mediated degradation. Moreover, EIN2 positively regulates the ethylene-dependent transcriptional responses mediated by EIN3 through an unknown mechanism. B, Diverse abiotic and biotic stresses induce the activation of MAPK modules involving MKK4/5/9 and MPK3/6. The activated MPK3 and MPK6 are capable of phosphorylating two isoforms of the ACC synthase, namely ACS2 and ACS6, at their C terminus. By this phosphorylation, ACS2/6 become stabilized and preserved from degradation via the 26S proteasome. As ACC synthases convert S-adenosyl-l-Met (SAM) to ACC, a precursor of ethylene, the stabilization of the two ACS2/6 isoforms leads to an enhanced ethylene production and activation of the ethylene signaling pathway.</div></div>
