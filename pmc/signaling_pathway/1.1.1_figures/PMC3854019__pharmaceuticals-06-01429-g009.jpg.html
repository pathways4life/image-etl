(<b>A</b>–<b>D</b>) Downregulated IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) canonical pathways are shown for A375 and WM3248 cell lines treated with either 5 µM NVP-LDE-225 or SMO siRNA. The transcriptional profiles of the DMSO treated and non-targeting siRNA treated A375 and WM3248 cells were used as controls in the IPA analysis. The stem cell pathways that were downregulated by both SMO siRNA and NVP-LDE-225 in both cell lines are marked with an asterisk (<b>*</b>).</div></div>
