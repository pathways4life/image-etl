B, Bar graph of regulated Wnt/β-catenin pathway signaling in SKBR3/100-8 (dark bars) and BT474/100-2 (open bars) compared to SKBR3 and BT474 analyzed by specific Wnt/β-catenin mRNA array. The relative level of each indicated gene was adjusted with GAPDH and each bar indicates mean fold change and SD from four determinations.</div></div>
