TLR ligands located on the surface of microorganisms are recognized by the extracellular TLRs, whereas nucleic acid TLR ligands located inside microorganisms are recognized by endosomal TLRs. TLR signaling is initially relayed through homotypic TIR-TIR interactions with TIR-domain containing adapters such as MyD88 or TRIF, and eventually results in activation of several pathways, including the canonical NF-kB pathway. This induces, among other genes, expression of the non-canonical NF-kB precursor p100. Proximal BCR signaling activates the PI3K and PLCγ2 pathways, converging to nodes such as TAK1/TAB2/3/TRAF6 for NF-κB and MAPK pathway activation. Dual BCR/TLR signaling integrates to induce p100 processing to p52, thereby activating the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, which is required for induction of AID. TNFR member CD40 induces both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB activation, thereby inducing CSR.</div></div>
