From: Systems Biology and Birth Defects Prevention: Blockade of the Glucocorticoid Receptor Prevents Arsenic-Induced Birth Defects. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for iAs-induced birth defects via the GR pathway. iAs appears to induce birth defects in the chick embryo as a result of signaling through the GR [also known as NR3C1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1)] pathway. Gene members of the GR pathway are shown in red (associated with embryonic development) or green (associated with developmental disorders). In embryos with inhibited signaling of the GR pathway via cortexolone, the iAs-induced birth defects are prevented.</div></div>
