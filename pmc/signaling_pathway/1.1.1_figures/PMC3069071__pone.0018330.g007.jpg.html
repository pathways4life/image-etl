Death signaling upon TRAIL binding to DR4 normally is dependent on mitochondrial dysfunction (induced by Bid/Bim as well as Bak/Bax activation) to induce cholangiocarcinoma cell death (Type II pathway), a pathway blocked by elevated Mcl-1 protein levels in cholangiocarcinoma cells. Alternately, following DR4 ligation, robust caspase 3 activation can induce Type I death signaling, a pathway inhibited by XIAP expression under normal conditions. Inhibition of SMO expression or activity sensitizes cells to TRAIL via increasing DR4 [19] and decreasing XIAP levels, thereby switching cells from Type II to Type I death receptor signaling and promoting apoptosis.</div></div>
