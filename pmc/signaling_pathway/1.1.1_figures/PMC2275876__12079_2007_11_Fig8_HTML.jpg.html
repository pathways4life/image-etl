Schematic representation of the regulation of SCD1 gene transcription in hepatic cells. The top part of the figure represents the signaling pathway implicated in the insulin regulation of SCD1 gene transcription. The large grey arrow represents the promoter where the different 5â€²-deletion constructs are indicated. The lower part represents the transcription factors implicated in the regulation of SCD1 gene transcription in liver in response to activation of the indicated signaling pathway</div></div>
