In cattle, FGF signaling represses NANOG expression via MAPK. As a result of NANOG expression, expression of GATA6 is inhibited. GATA6 expression is also activated via an as yet unknown (question mark) FGF/MAPK-independent pathway. In human, activation of NANOG and GATA6 expression is coordinated via unknown (question mark) mechanisms.</div></div>
