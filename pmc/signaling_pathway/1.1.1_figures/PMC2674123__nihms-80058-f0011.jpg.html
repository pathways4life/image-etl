Green nodes represent over-expression in MDAH-2774 and red nodes represent over-expression in TOV-112D. Plain nodes are imported from IPKB. This figure has been manually modified from integrative analysis by adding some proteins which were identified from only one cell line but did not meet the threshold of integrative analysis.</div></div>
