From: Regulation of neural progenitor cell state by ephrin-B. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>A working model of the function of ephrin-B–RGS pathway.</b> Our results indicate that the RGS-mediated ephrin-B reverse signaling pathway is required for the maintenance of neural progenitor cells. As the RGS domain acts as an inhibitor of Gα subunit signaling, our data suggest that Gα subunit may function as an activator of progenitor differentiation. Future studies are required to investigate this potential role of Gα subunit. In addition, whether and how EphB functions in the activation of ephrin-B–RGS pathway in neural progenitor cells will also need to be further studied.</div></div>
