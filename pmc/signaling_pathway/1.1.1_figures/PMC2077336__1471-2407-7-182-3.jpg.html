The Geneplot function in the Global Test program [12, 14] was applied and the contribution of the individual genes in each selected pathway is plotted. The numbers at the X-axis represent the number of genes in the respective pathway in ER-positive (Left) or ER-negative tumors (Right). The values at the Y-axis, represent the contribution (influence) of each individual gene in the selected pathway with DMFS. Negative values indicate there is no association between the gene expression and DMFS. Horizontal markers in a bar indicates one standard deviation away from the reference point, two or more horizontal markers in a bar indicates that the association of the corresponding gene with DMFS is statistically significant. The green bars reflect genes that are positively associated with DMFS, indicating a higher expression in tumors without metastatic capability. The red bars reflect genes that are negatively associated with DMFS, indicative of higher expression in tumors with metastatic capability. (<b>A</b>) ER-positive tumors: from top to bottom: "apoptosis" pathway consisting of 282 genes, "regulation of cell cycle" pathway consisting of 228 genes, "immune response" pathway consisting of 379 genes, and "mitosis"? pathway consisting of 100 genes. (<b>B</b>) ER-negative tumors: from top to bottom: "regulation of cell growth" pathway consisting of 58 genes, "cell adhesion" pathway consisting of 327 genes, "regulation of G-coupled receptor signaling" pathway consisting of 20 genes, and "skeletal development" pathway consisting of 105 genes.</div></div>
