Leptin receptor <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>.  From: Leptin and the CNS Control of Glucose Metabolism. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Leptin binding to LepRb mediates activation of the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase-2 (Jak2), resulting in phosphorylation of three tyrosine residues (Tyr985, Tyr1077, Tyr1138). Phosphorylation of Tyr985 recruits SHP-2, leading to the activation of the ERK pathway, and also binds to suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3), a negative regulator of LepRb signaling. Phosphorylation of Tyr1077 mediates signal transduction and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5). Phosphorylation of Tyr1138 recruits and activates STAT3 and STAT5. Activation of STAT3 leads to increased SOCS-3 expression which acts as a negative feedback inhibitor of leptin signaling, in part, by binding to Tyr985 of LepRb. In addition, hypothalamic inflammation is also induced during high-fat feeding and increases SOCS-3 expression. Similar to SOCS-3, protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)1B may also inhibit LepRb signaling via dephosphorylation of Jak2.</div></div>
