Progestogen prevents synaptic dysfunction associated with aging and neurodegeneration through (1) ligand activation of a progesterone receptor, (2) which initiates second messenger signaling cascades (3) to promote neuronal survival. These signaling cascades converge on mitochondrial function to protect against against toxic insults and include the passive prevention signaling pathway and the active protection signaling pathway. In the passive prevention signaling pathway, both ERK/CREB/Bcl-2 and Akt pathways are simultaneously activated, which (4) enhances mitochondrial function and enables neurons to better withstand neurodegenerative insults. The active protection pathway acts to block AÎ²-induced JNK activation and mitochondrial dysfunction.</div></div>
