A: the original concepts of linear signal transduction pathways held that stimuli evoke responses via the actions of transducers (such as G proteins or PKC isoforms). B: models of signal transduction were first revised to allow for the presence of multiple stimuli that can converge on a single signaling pathway and alter the amplitude of a signaling response. This could reflect the activation of different pools of a single enzyme. Alternatively, amplitude control might be due to the differential stimulatory properties of full or partial agonists. C: more current models of signaling transduction allow for a high level of signal integration by proteins (such as PKCÎ´) that are regulated through conformational changes, translocation events, and various posttranslational modifications (phosphorylation, oxidation, tyrosine nitration, etc.) that can underlie stimulus-specific signaling responses.</div></div>
