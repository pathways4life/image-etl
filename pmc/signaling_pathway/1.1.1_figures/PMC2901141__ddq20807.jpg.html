From: BMP antagonism protects Nodal <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in the gastrula to promote the tissue interactions underlying mammalian forebrain and craniofacial patterning. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model for the interaction of Nodal and anti-BMP activities during the formation of the anterior primitive streak and its derivatives. (<b>A</b>) BMP signaling activation (blue) is restricted, and Nodal signaling enhanced, by the synergistic interaction of Chrd and Nodal in the APS (green/red) at the MS (A1) stage, and of Nog and Smad3 in the anterior AME (green) at the 0B stage (A2). These interactions promote the specification of the APS and/or its derivatives, the AME and ADE, and the BMP antagonism they convey to promote forebrain initiation in the ectoderm (green arrows). (<b>B</b>) In Chrd−/−;Nodal+/− embryos, the APS is defective due to excess BMP activation and reduced Nodal signaling (B1), which results in AME/ADE deficiency (B2). (<b>C</b>) In Nog−/−;Smad3+/− embryos, early APS appears normal (C1), but AME emerging from the compromised distal APS (early node) is defective due to ectopic BMP activation and decreased Nodal pathway signaling (C2).</div></div>
