Increased cAMP binds and activates PKA but does not stimulate MUC5AC transcription and production. β-arrestin2 phosphorylates ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, the key players, which activate transcription factors to stimulate MUC5AC transcription and production. β-AR antagonists, kinase inhibitors and molecular biological methods of interfering with signaling molecules are also shown.</div></div>
