From: Sphingosine-1-Phosphate-Specific G Protein-Coupled Receptors as Novel Therapeutic Targets for Atherosclerosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">S1P receptor signaling. S1P1 couples exclusively to Gi, whereas S1P2 and S1P3 couple to multiple G proteins. The G proteins preferred by S1P2 and S1P3 are G12/13 and Gq, respectively. Gi couples to stimulation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt/Rac pathway and Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, G12/13 couples to activation of Rho pathway, mediating Rac inhibition, NF-κB activation and PTEN stimulation. Gq mediates stimulation of phospholipase C (PLCβ) pathway. Nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in ECs is fully activated by Gi- and Akt-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS in concert with a Gq-mediated, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activation. The straight and dotted lines show the stimulatory and inhibitory regulations, respectively.</div></div>
