From: Transcriptional feedback control of insulin receptor by dFOXO/FOXO1. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed mechanism by which FOXO1 regulates the sensitivity of the InR signaling pathway through a feedback mechanism that involves up-regulation of InR and IRS-2 upon fasting. When nutrients are high, the InR pathway turns down FOXO1 activity and the levels of InR and IRS-2 drop, dampening the signaling through the InR pathway. When nutrient conditions change, FOXO1 is active and it sensitizes the pathway by activating the transcription of InR and IRS-2.</div></div>
