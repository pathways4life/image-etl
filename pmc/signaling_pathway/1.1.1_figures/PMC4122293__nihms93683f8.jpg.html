Schematic diagram of endothelin-1 synthesis signal transduction pathways and autocrine effects.  From: Fibronectin Stimulates Endothelin-1 Synthesis in Rat Hepatic Myofibroblasts via a Src/ERK Regulated <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">On the left, fibronectin promotes ET-1 production by activating Src, which, in turn, activates a Shc/Grb2/Sos complex by direct phosphorylation of Shc; phosphorylated Shc then activates the ERK signaling pathway, which leads to increased preproendothelin-1 expression. Increased endogenous ET-1 activity contributes to enhanced contraction and smooth muscle Î± actin expression in activated stellate cells. The proposed pathway to cellular contraction is based on previous literature in smooth muscle cells 27. Abbreviations: PKC = protein kinase C, MLC = myosin light chain, MLCK = myosin light chain kinase.</div></div>
