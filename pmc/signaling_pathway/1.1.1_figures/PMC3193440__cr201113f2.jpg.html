From: NF-?B in immunobiology. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">NF-κB in lymphoid organogenesis. NF-κB regulates key components of a positive feedback loop between hematopoietic and stromal cells. LTα1β2-expressing hematopoietic cells induce production of VCAM-1 through the canonical NF-κB pathway and chemokines through the non-canonical pathway in LTβR-expressing stromal cells. Stromal expression of chemokines induces the upregulation of integrins (α4β1) on hematopoietic cells resulting in increased recruitment of LTα1β2-expressing cells, and increased signaling through stromal LTβR. RANKL signaling through RANK on the hematopoietic cell leads to activation of NF-κB, and further upregulation of LTα1β2.</div></div>
