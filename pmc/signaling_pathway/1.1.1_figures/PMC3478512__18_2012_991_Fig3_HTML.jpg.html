Closed arrows/lines indicate activation and requirement in NC tissues. Dotted lines indicate activation in NC tissues, but requirement is unknown. BMP/Smad signaling must be inhibited during gastrulation, but activated upon neurulation. The specific stage when Smad signaling first becomes activated in the NC has not been determined. FGF/Erk signaling is activated throughout early NC development, but has only been functionally implicated during early gastrula stages [49, 50]. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is thought to be required at all stages of early NC development, but becomes more strongly activated by neurulation [31]. The precise time when Notch is required is still debated, but may play a role in the initial induction during gastrulation. <b>b</b> Spatial activation of BMP, FGF, Wnt, and Notch signaling during Xenopus gastrulation and neurulation. BMP/Smad, FGF/Erk, and Wnt/β-catenin activation based on data from [199, 200]. Notch/Delta activation inferred from requirements in germ layer segregation and NC development [8, 12, 201]. Overall, spatiotemporal activation of these pathways is conserved between Xenopus and zebrafish. <b>c</b> Spatial expression and participation of signaling molecules in Xenopus neural crest induction at the gastrula stage. Diagram corresponds to dotted box of stage 10 gastrula in <b>b</b>. Molecules in bold have support from multiple studies. Solid lines indicate known relationships, dotted lines indicate potential relationships. NC induction results from the combined action of Wnt/β-catenin, FGF, Indian Hedgehog, and non-canonical Wnt signaling. Fgf8a is thought to regulate the expression of Wnt8 in the dorsolateral marginal zone (DLMZ), but may signal to the prospective neural crest itself. Wnt8 and Wnt3a signaling from the DLMZ activate canonical Wnt signaling in the prospective neural crest. Multiple agonists and antagonists of BMP and Wnt signaling are expressed in the Organizer, DMZ, and DLMZ and function in dorsal–ventral and anterior–posterior patterning, and these molecules likely also participate in NC induction (dotted line). Expression of other potential signaling molecules and regulators is presented. See main text for details on the participation of individual signaling molecules. <b>d</b> Participation of signaling molecules in the maintenance of NC progenitors in Xenopus neurulation. Diagram corresponds to section at dotted line in stage 14 neurula in <b>b</b>. NC maintenance requires activation of Smad1/5/8, Wnt/β-catenin, Notch/Delta, Indian Hedgehog, and Endothelin-A signaling. BMP and Wnt signals are likely mediated by Bmp4, Bmp7, Wnt1, and Wnt8, expressed in the neural folds upon neurulation. Additionally, Wnt8 is present in the paraxial mesoderm and Wnt3a in the neural plate. Notch signaling is thought to operate both by regulating Bmp ligand levels and leading to the expression of NC specifiers.
