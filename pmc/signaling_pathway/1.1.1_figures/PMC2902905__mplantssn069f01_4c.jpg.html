Endosome-mediated trafficking of PINs operates in regulating PIN polarity. At least two distinct pathways involving early endosomes are involved, which influence PIN1 and PIN2 trafficking through ES1-independent and ES1-dependent early endosomes, respectively. The SNX1/VPS29 retromer complex and the GNOM pathway appear to reside in late endosomes that may regulate PIN sorting, degradation in vacuoles, and recycling to the PM. Switching or re-polarization of PINs seems to involve distinct trafficking pathways as well. The GNOM-dependent pathway is involved in transcytosis-mediated polarity switching between the apical and basal sides, whereas the GNOM-independent and VSP29-dependent pathway may regulate PIN re-polarization to the lateral side. The precise relationship among early endosomes, TGN, late endosomes, recycling endosomes, and lytic endosomes remains unclear and is most likely quite complex. Speculative pathways are indicated by dotted lines. Signaling mechanisms regulating PIN trafficking are emerging. PID kinase directly phosphorylates PIN1 to direct the apical localization of PIN1. PP2A phosphatases have an opposite role by directing basipetal localization of PINs via the GNOM-mediated pathway. Calcium signaling and a signaling pathway involving PDK1 kinase are suggested to act upstream of those pathways. Sterols may also play some roles in generating polarity signal or regulate the formation of membrane microdomains necessary for the polar PIN localization. ROP signaling-mediated cell polarity may also contribute to PIN polarity signaling in an unknown manner. Auxin itself is shown to inhibit both ES1-insensitive PIN1 endocytosis and ES1-sensitive PIN2 endocytosis. There is also some evidence that auxin regulates PIN localization via the TIR1-dependent signaling pathway as well as having a more indirect effect by modulating PIN protein expression.</div></div>
