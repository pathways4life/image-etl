The NF-κB profile can be obtained by using various IKK profiles with different intensities and stimulation durations in the IKK-NF-κB signaling simulator. Three examples of IKK stimuli and the corresponding NF-κB profiles are shown. (A) The acute stimulus of IKK that has a peak at around two hours and a positive feedback control after ten hours. (B) A weak stimulus of IKK. (C) The IKK stimulus is not an impulse stimulation. It rises steeply during the first two hours and then increases slowly until ten hours.</div></div>
