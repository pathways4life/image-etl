Cross talk and bidirectional (gray arrows) signaling between mER, RTK, mER and downstream phosphorylation of Ser118 and 167 by MAPK/ERK and PI3-K/Akt pathway respectively leads to activation of estrogen regulated genes. GSK-3β inhibits (blocking red arrows) phosphorylation of Ser118 which is further inactivated by PI3-K/AKT.<b>Abbreviations:</b> DBD, DNA binding domain; NLS, Nuclear localization sequence.</div></div>
