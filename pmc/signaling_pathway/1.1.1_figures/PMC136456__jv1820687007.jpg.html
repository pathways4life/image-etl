NS5A, through its C-terminal proline-rich SH3-binding motif, directly interacts with Grb2 to perturb the downstream MAPK pathway, which may contribute to regulation of translation (25) and perturbation of IFN signaling (24). On the other hand, the N-terminal region of NS5A directly interacts with the p85 subunit of PI3K, which enhances the PI3K-AKT pathway and regulates the downstream apoptosis machinery. The modulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway by NS5A may contribute to cell survival and inhibition of apoptosis in virus-infected cells, resulting in viral persistence and contributing to pathogenesis.</div></div>
