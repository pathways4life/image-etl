PD-1 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in inflamed tissue.  From: Antagonist Antibodies to PD-1 and B7-H1 (PD-L1) in the Treatment of Advanced Human Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Ligation of T-cell PD-1 by B7-H1 on APC leads to the formation of PD-1/TCR microclusters and the subsequent recruitment of SHP2 phosphatases, which dephosphorylate multiple members of the TCR signaling pathway. This abrogates downstream effects of T-cell activation, including cytokine production, cell-cycle progression, and the expression of survival proteins. By preventing T-cell activation, PD-1 signaling contributes to the maintenance of tolerance to self-antigens and prevents immune-mediated damage of healthy tissue during the resolution of infection and other inflammatory responses.</div></div>
