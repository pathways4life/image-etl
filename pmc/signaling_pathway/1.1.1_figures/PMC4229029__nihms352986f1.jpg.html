Extracellular growth factors bind with cell receptors, activating a series of intricately regulated signaling. Tumor cells retain some levels of feedback inhibition, activation of one pathway might lead to inhibition of upstream substrates within the pathway, and/or the inhibition of compensatory pathways. Tumor cells depend on certain oncogenes for growth (“oncogene addiction”), these oncogene products provide good targets for molecularly targeted therapies. <b>B</b>. Molecular inhibitors suppress the overactivated growth/survival pathway, therefore tumors shrink. <b>C</b>. After prolonged treatment, induction of growth/survival signals of the same pathway and/or compensatory pathways leads to resistance against molecular inhibitors, which might be due to the disrupted feedback inhibitions. +++, overactivated signaling.</div></div>
