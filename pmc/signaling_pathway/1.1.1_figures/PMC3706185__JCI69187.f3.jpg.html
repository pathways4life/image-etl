STALs inhibit phosphorylation of signaling components of all major BCR signaling pathways and induce hypophosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1 in WT B cells, but not Cd22-deficient IgMHEL B cells. Data are a subset of Supplemental Figure 4. (<b>B</b>) Analysis of FoxO1 staining in IgMHEL B cells by confocal microscopy. Cells were stimulated for 2 hours with the indicated liposomes and stained with anti-FoxO1, phalloidin, and DAPI. Inserts are a representative cell at 3 times the magnification. Original magnification, Ã—63. </div></div>
