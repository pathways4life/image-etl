These specimens were transcriptomally profiled and classified into G-CIMP+ and G-CIMP- using the PAM classifier described above. 6 G-CIMP+ and 19 G-CIMP- glioblastomas were identified. (B) Representative image of Chromatogram profile after direct DNA sequencing showing IDH1 mutations in G-CIMP+ glioblastoma samples. All specimens predicted by PAM to be G-CIMP+ harbored the IDH1-R132H mutation. (C) Decreased pERK level in G-CIMP+ glioblastoma specimens. Ras/RTK signaling was analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody against pERK, an established biomarker for Ras/RTK pathway activity. (D) Levels of pERK, ERK and actin in (C) were analyzed using Image J software (Bethesda, MD). The level of pERK was normalized (see Methods) and plotted as a function of G-CIMP status.</div></div>
