NF-ÎºB, PI3K/AKT and SRF are well-known for their roles in various cellular functions, particularly cell survival and cell proliferation. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is activated indirectly through Tax-dependent cytokine induction, while all other signaling molecules/signaling pathways are directly regulated by Tax. SRF: serum response factor.</div></div>
