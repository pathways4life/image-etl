To prevent protein aggregation, unfolded or misfolded proteins are degraded to peptides by the quality control protease ClpP in the mitochondrial matrix [68]. HAF-1-mediated peptide efflux leads to activation of the bZip transcription factor ATFS-1 that accumulates in the nucleus. HAF-1-mediated peptide efflux is also required for the accumulation of the ubiquitin-like protein UBL-5 which complexes with the transcription factor DVE-1 [69]. ATFS-1 and DVE-1/UBL-5 then cooperatively induce the expression of mitochondrial chaperone genes including Hsp60 and mtHsp70 in order to restore protein homeostasis.</div></div>
