Total cell lysates were prepared from PC12 cells treated with CM of vehicle, TG-CKJ, and SH-CKJ. Thirty micrograms of protein per sample was immunoblotted with antibody for each protein (A). The intensity of each band was determined using an imaging densitometer, and the relative level of each protein was calculated based on the intensity of actin (B). Three samples were assayed in triplicate via Western blot analysis. Values of the data represent the meansÂ±SD.</div></div>
