From: Expression Analysis of All Protease Genes Reveals Cathepsin K to Be Overexpressed in Glioblastoma. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">An extensive literature search revealed that the candidate genes are cross-linked to 3 signaling pathways: NF-κB, Akt and MAPK, which all play a role in cancer. NF-κB signaling pathway has a crucial role in regulating immune responses, whereas Akt signaling has been shown to inhibit the growth of GBM cells and GBM stem-like cells that may also be impaired by MAPK signaling disruption. Because of the RT-qPCR results, CTSK's role has been examined and it was found via cross linking to other candidate genes obtained via osteopontin (OPN) gene functions.</div></div>
