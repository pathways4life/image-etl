The HOG pathway consists of multiple signaling components and is involved in a variety of stress responses, including osmotic, oxidative, and heavy metal stresses, breaches of cell wall integrity, and anti-fungal drug responses. Following exposure to an environmental cue, signals are transmitted to downstream genes of the HOG pathway via a two-component-like phosphorelay system and a HOG MAPK module composed of Ssk2 MAPK kinase kinase, Pbs2 MAPK kinase, and Hog1 MAPK.</div></div>
