Intracellular Phospholipases participate in Dual Pathways of Myocardial Lipid Signal Transduction.  From: Calcium Independent Phospholipases in the Heart: Mediators of Cellular <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>, Bioenergetics and Ischemia-induced Electrophysiologic Dysfunction. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Cytosolic phospholipases A2 (cPLA2) and calcium-independent phospholipases A2 (iPLA2) hydrolyze both diacyl and plasmalogen phospholipids to form free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. Thus, these intracellular phospholipases mediate dual pathways of cellular activation through the release of arachidonic acid and the concomitant production of lysolipids from membrane phospholipids. Remarkably, iPLA2Î³ activity on diacyl phospholipids with arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position generates 2-arachidonoyl lysophospholipids that are unique branch point metabolites in myocardial signaling since they can be further processed through an additional bifurcating signaling pathway to generate either eicosanoids or endocannabinoids for cellular signaling functions.</div></div>
