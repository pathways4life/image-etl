Summary of neural and limb patterning phenotypes in Hh <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> and cilia mutants.  From: The Primary Cilium: A <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Center During Vertebrate Development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>a</b> | In wild-type (WT) embryos, ventral neural cell fates are specified by a gradient of Shh. The number and identity of digits in the limb is established by a Shh gradient from the posterior limb bud opposed by anterior Gli3 repressor (Gli3R). <b>b</b> | In the absence of Hh, (e.g. Smo −/−), ventral neural cell fates are lost. The limbs of Shh mutants lack digits. <b>c</b> | If the pathway is hyperactive (e.g. Ptch −/−), ventral cell types expand in the neural tube. Activation of the pathway within the limb, such as in Gli3 mutants (which lack Gli3R), causes the formation of extra digits. <b>d</b> | Anterograde IFT mutants (e.g. the IFT-B mutants Ift88 or Ift172) lack cilia: Hh signaling is reduced, and the neural tube is dorsalized. This phenotype is milder than in (<b>b</b>) because cilia are also required for cilia Gli3R processing, and cell types that require low levels of Hh signaling are specified. Reduced Gli3R results in polydactyly. Dynein mutants display a similar phenotype, however they retain motor neurons in the caudal neural tube. <b>e</b> | IFT-A mutants (ie Ift139) exhibit phenotypes consistent with excess Hh signaling. <b>f</b> | Mutations that disrupt the kinesin Kif7 cause a partial activation of the Hh pathway, with a modest expansion of cells that require intermediate levels of Hh.</div></div>
