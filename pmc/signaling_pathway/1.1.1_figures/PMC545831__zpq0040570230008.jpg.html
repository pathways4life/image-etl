From: Glutamate regulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation in neostriatal neurons involves activation of multiple <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> cascades. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Signaling cascades activated by glutamate NMDA/AMPA and mGlu receptors. Glutamate activates multiple signaling cascades by activation of NMDA/AMPA and mGlu1/5 receptors (A), leading to the modulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation at Thr-34 (B) and Thr-75 (C) and the regulation of PP-1 and PKA activities. Pathways leading to increased phospho-Thr-34 DARPP-32 and increased PP-1 inhibition are shown in blue, and those leading to decreased phospho-Thr-34 DARPP-32 and decreased PP-1 inhibition are shown in red. Inhibition of PP-1 by phospho-Thr-34 DARPP-32 and inhibition of PKA by phospho-Thr-75 DARPP-32 are shown in orange. (B) In the initial 15–30 s of incubation, activation of NMDA/AMPA and mGlu5 receptors in nNOS-positive interneurons stimulates the synthesis and release of NO, leading to activation in medium spiny neurons of PKG and DARPP-32 Thr-34 phosphorylation. At 1–5 min of incubation, activation of NMDA/AMPA receptors induces Ca2+-dependent activation of PP-2B, resulting in the dephosphorylation of Thr-34. At 5–10 min of incubation, there is a gradual increase in DARPP-32 Thr-34 phosphorylation. This increase is due, in part, to activation of a pathway involving mGlu5 receptor/PLC/CK1/phospho-Ser-130 DARPP-32, resulting in inhibition of dephosphorylation of phospho-Thr-34 by PP-2B, and, in part, to activation of signaling through the adenosine A2A receptor pathway. A synergistic activation of adenosine A2A receptor signaling involves (i) activation of an mGlu5 receptor/ERK pathway and, through some yet unknown mechanism, increased efficiency of A2A receptor-induced cAMP formation, and (ii) increased extracellular adenosine levels arising from both medium spiny neurons and presynaptic terminals (15). (C) In the initial 5 min of incubation, activation of NMDA/AMPA receptors induces Ca2+-dependent activation of PP-2A, resulting in the dephosphorylation of Thr-75. Subsequently, activation of a pathway involving mGlu1 receptor/PLC/CK1/Cdk5 increases the phosphorylation of Thr-75.</div></div>
