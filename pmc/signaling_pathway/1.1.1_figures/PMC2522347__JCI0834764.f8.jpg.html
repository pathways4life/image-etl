Representative adjacent sections from the specimens used for the TMAs show staining for the indicated proteins. Shown are examples of benign prostatic tissue (Normal), a tumor without activation of the PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway (Tumor 1), and a tumor with activation of this pathway (Tumor 2). Note that the expression of PTEN is inversely correlated with expression of p-AKT, p-mTOR, and p-S6. (<b>M</b>–<b>O</b>) Expression of p-ERK activation on semiadjacent sections of the same specimens. Note that, in these samples, p-ERK activation is well correlated with activation of components of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Scale bar: 100 μm.    </div></div>
