Akt and p38α can both activate the canonical pathway by inhibiting GSK3β activity, preventing it from phosphorylating β-catenin. Akt phosphorylates GSK3β at the N terminus on Ser9, while P38α phosphorylates the C-terminal residue Ser839. Conversely, activation of the non-canonical Wnt/JNK pathway has been observed to inhibit nuclear accumulation of β-catenin under some circumstances. Release of calcium from intracellular stores, such as occurs when the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway is activated, can lead to activation of nemo-like kinase (NLK), which directly phosphorylates TCF to inhibit interaction with β-catenin. Induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) via the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway has also been observed to promote GSK3β-independent degradation of β-catenin, but the mechanism is poorly understood.
