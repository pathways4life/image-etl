From: The regulation of organ size in Drosophila. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A model of the Fat/Hippo regulation of growth. Dpp signaling may affect signaling through the pathway via its effects on Dachsous and Fat. Wingless signaling may affect the activity of Yorkie through Vestigialâ€™s interaction with Scalloped, a Yorkie co-factor. How Vestigial affects the interaction between Yorkie and Scalloped is, however, unclear. Mechanical forces may affect the activity of Hippo through their effect on Merlin and Expanded. Solid lines indicate protein-protein binding, solid arrows indicate biochemical interactions, dotted arrows indicate genetic interactions, gray arrow indicates hypothetical interaction.
