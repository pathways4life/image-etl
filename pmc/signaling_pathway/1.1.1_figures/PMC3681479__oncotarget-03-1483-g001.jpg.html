Cross talk between Akt/mTOR and MEK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways.  From: The promise of dual targeting Akt/mTOR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in lethal prostate cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Loss of function of PTEN leads to activation of the mTOR pathway mainly via the PI3K/Akt pathway and secondarily via the MEK pathway. Inhibition of mTOR using MK-8669 leads to a feedback loop activation of Akt (1) Our findings suggest that inhibition of Akt using MK-2206 is not effective for inhibition of mTOR because of MEK pathway activation (2). Dual inhibition of both with MK-8669 and MK-2206 leads to effective inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling.</div></div>
