TGF-β signaling is initiated by the binding of TGF-β to its receptors, transforming growth factor-β receptor I (TGF-β RI) and transforming growth factor-β receptor II (TGF-β RII), and receptor tyrosine kinase activation which then phosphorylates Smad2/3. Activated Smad2/3 regulates gene expression of Smad4 and other transcription factors (TF). Feedback regulation is mediated by Smad6/7, which interferes the binding of Smad2/3 to TGF-β receptors and inhibits transcription. Both Smad6 and Smad7 are in turn induced by TGF-β and regulated by Smad ubiquitin regulatory factors (Smurfs). Synthetic inhibitors inactivate the TGF-β pathway by inhibition of receptor enzymatic activity.</div></div>
