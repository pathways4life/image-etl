TCR engagement activates PLCγ1, which hydrolyzes PIP2 to generate DAG and IP3, two important second messengers that trigger the activation of multiple signal cascades. IP3 triggers Ca2+ influx, which, in turn, induces the activation of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway. DAG associates and activates RasGRP1 and PKCθ, resulting in the activation of the Ras-Erk1/2-AP1 and IKK-NFκB pathways, respectively. CD28 provides costimulation and enhances PI3K-Akt activation. The Ca2+-NFAT pathway alone induces T cell anergy by increasing expression of anergy-promoting molecules. This pathway, in concert with DAG-mediated pathways, induces T cell activation. DGKs convert DAG to PA and, thus, inhibit T cell activation. In T cells, the RasGRP1-Ras-Erk1/2 pathway as well as the PI3K-Akt pathway, is important for mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling. TSC1 inhibits mTORC1, but promotes mTORC2 signaling and is important for T cell survival, quiescence and anergy.</div></div>
