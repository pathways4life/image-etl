The initiation of the Notch signaling pathway begins when the Notch ligand binds to the Notch receptor. This action triggers two proteolytic cleavages by ADAM-type protease (S2) and Î³-secretase (S3), respectively. Following cleavages, the activated form of Notch is released (NICD) and is translocated to the nucleus, where NICD forms complexes with specific DNA-binding proteins (CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG-1 and Mastermind/SEL-8). Afterward the transcriptional process of target genes is initiated. MAML1: Mastermind-like 1 protein; CBF1: DNA-binding transcription factor.</div></div>
