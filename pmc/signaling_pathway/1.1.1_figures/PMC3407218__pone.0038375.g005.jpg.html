E-cadherin (labeled as E-cad), MMP-2, MMP-9, and titin may function as the downstream targets of EGFR/ERK signaling pathway in the CsA-induced invasion of human trophoblast cells. CsA may promote the activation of EGFR via CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. EGFR and its downstream ERK signaling pathway may also be involved in the CsA-induced proliferation of human trophoblast cells. Blue lines represent the signaling pathways proved to be involved in the regulation of CsA on the invasion of human trophoblast cells, and red lines represent the putative signaling pathways involved in the regulation of CsA on the proliferation of trophoblast cells.</div></div>
