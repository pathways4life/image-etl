Two ligands (Dll1, Jag1), two receptors (Notch2, Notch3), and the downstream target of Notch/Rbp-J signaling (Hes1) are expressed in the oral ectoderm and the Rathke's pouch (RP) by E12.5. At E13.5, Dll1, Jag1, Notch2, Notch3, and Hes1 expression are down-regulated in the anterior pituitary (AP) and are further confined to the perilumenal cells. At E14.5, Jag1 is expressed in the mesenchymal cells surrounding and within the pituitary gland. (IL) Intermediate lobe.</div></div>
