From: Hedgehog <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Regulates Nociceptive Sensitization. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Hh (from an as yet undetermined source tissue) acts through Patched (whose overexpression blocks sensitization), which subsequently inhibits Smoothened (required for sensitization) to activate signal transduction. The subsequent signaling steps likely involve the transcriptional activity of Cubitus interruptus (required for sensitization) and other components of the canonical Hh signaling pathway. For thermal allodynia, this pathway acts through the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel Painless, and for thermal hyperalgesia it requires the TRP channel dTRPA1.</div></div>
