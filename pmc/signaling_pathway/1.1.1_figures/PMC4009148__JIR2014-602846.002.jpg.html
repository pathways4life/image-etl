From: Potential Involvement of IL-17F in Asthma. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Signaling pathways induced by IL-17F. IL-17F utilizes a heterodimer of IL-17RA and IL-17RC as its receptor, and then IL-17RA engages the SEFIR domain-containing Act-1. Act-1 is required for recruitment of TRAF6, leading to the activation of TAK1. The Raf1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2-p90RSK/MSK1-CREB is the pivotal signaling pathway. On the other hand, IL-17F also activates transcriptional factors such as C/EBPβ, C/EBPγ, and NF-κB. Activation of these pathways leads to the expression of various inflammatory molecules.</div></div>
