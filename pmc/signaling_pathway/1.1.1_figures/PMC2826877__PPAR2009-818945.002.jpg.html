Binding of insulin to its tyrosine kinase receptor engages a cascade of intracellular phosphorylation events, including activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and ERK-1/2, that promote multiple biological responses, including glucose uptake, lipid metabolism, survival, differentiation, and modulation of gene transcription.</div></div>
