The IPA depicted the genes involved, their interactions, and the cellular and metabolic reactions that constituted the pathway. Colored molecules represented genes that appeared in the data set studied. Red and green molecules were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in limbal epithelial cells. Gray molecules did not meet the user defined cutoff of 2.</div></div>
