From: Integrins Regulate Microtubule Nucleating Activity of Centrosome through Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase/Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase Kinase/Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (MEK/ERK) <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Model.</b> Our data are consistent with published reports that the androgen receptor and Src form a signaling module that activates MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling in response to stimulation with androgen. We show that integrins regulate the formation of the androgen receptor-Src complex and the ability of androgen to trigger the activation of AKT and ERK. Additionally, our results demonstrate that MEK/ERK signaling promotes the centrosomal accumulation of Î³-tubulin and microtubule nucleation independent of cell type and culture conditions. Inhibiting MEK/ERK signaling with U0126 inhibits microtubule nucleation when cells are adhered by wild-type integrins, and expression of ca-RAF to activate MEK/ERK signaling is sufficient to rescue microtubule nucleation when integrin function is inhibited. Although inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling does not effect microtubule nucleation, this pathway may regulate other processes required for the assembly of the microtubule cytoskeleton.</div></div>
