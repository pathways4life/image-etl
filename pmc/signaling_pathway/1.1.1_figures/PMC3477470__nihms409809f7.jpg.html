Regulation of Mct1 by cAMP-dependent internalization into caveolae and early endosomes, and an unregulated clathrin-dependent recycling <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>.  From: Regulation of Mct1 by cAMP-dependent internalization in rat brain endothelial cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Right side: In the regulated pathway, activation of Î²-adrenergic receptors leads to cAMP production and activation of a phosphatase which dephosphorylates plasma membrane Mct1, and caveolin-1 (hairpin structures), facilitating an interaction between Mct1 and caveolin-1 to promote internalization of Mct1 into caveolae (CAV) and early endosomes (EE). From here Mct1 could be trafficked to various compartments such as late endosomes and lysosomes (LE/LYS), similar to the protein-kinase dependent trafficking of kainite receptors and aquaporins (Martin and Henley 2004; Sidhaye et al., 2005). Left side: In the constitutive pathway, Mct1 is internalized into clathrin coated vesicles (CCV) where it is trafficked to recycling endosomes (RE) for redistribution on the plasma membrane, however, adrenergic signaling does not affect this trafficking pathway.</div></div>
