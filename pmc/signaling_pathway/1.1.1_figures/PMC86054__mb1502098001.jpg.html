The invasive-filamentous pathway is depicted on the left, and the mating pathway is shown on the right. Ste5 binds Ste11, Ste7, and Fus3 proteins and is required for pheromone-induced signaling (41). FRE, filamentation- and invasion-responsive element; PRE, pheromone-responsive element; Pbox, Mcm1 binding site. In the invasive-filamentous pathway, Ste12 binds to FRE cooperatively with Tec1. Ste12 acts in the mating pathway by binding to DNA as a homomultimer or as a heteromultimer with Mcm1.</div></div>
