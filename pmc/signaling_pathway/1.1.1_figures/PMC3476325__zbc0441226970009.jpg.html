From: CCL2/CCR2 Chemokine <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Coordinates Survival and Motility of Breast Cancer Cells through Smad3 Protein- and p42/44 Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK)-dependent Mechanisms. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Proposed model for how CCL2 signaling through CCR2 signaling regulates survival and motility of breast cancer cells.</b> CCL2 binds to CCR2 to stimulate Smad3 and p42/44MAPK pathways. In one pathway, CCL2 induces MEK signaling through p42/44MAPK independently of Smad3 to promote cell survival. In addition, CCL2 activates Smad3, which cooperates with the MEK-p42/44MAPK pathway to regulate cell motility and survival through RhoA-dependent mechanisms.</div></div>
