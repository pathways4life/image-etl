B, α-MSH up-regulates both the cAMP-dependent and -independent signaling pathways (step 1) (arrow/text size indicates direction of effect). cAMP is generated only while the MC4R is on the plasma membrane; pERK remains up-regulated following receptor internalization (step 2) until ligand and receptor dissociate along the endocytic recycling pathway (step 3). Upon α-MSH withdrawal, cAMP and pERK return to basal levels (step 4). C, ASP antagonizes cAMP signaling through its C terminus (step 1) and pERK signaling through its N terminus (step 2) (requiring MGRN1 and ATRN). pERK is only completely attenuated following ASP-dependent MC4R degradation in the lysosome (step 3). Loss-of-function mutations in ATRN or MGRN1 impair the ASP-dependent lysosomal trafficking of MC4R, preventing the full reduction of pERK signaling and allowing basal cAMP-independent activity to be maintained. The hypothetical pERK signaling pathway is analogous to that of the activated EGF receptor; ERK signaling initiated at the cell surface continues from within the cell until the EGF receptor enters the lysosome.</div></div>
