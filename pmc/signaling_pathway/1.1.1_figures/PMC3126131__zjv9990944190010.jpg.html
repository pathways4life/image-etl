Infection of cells by DNA or RNA viruses triggers the cellular apoptotic pathway by RIG-I signaling-mediated activation of IRF-3 and Bax to cause their translocation to mitochondria, which in turn activates the apoptotic pathway. Cytosolic DNA, generated upon infection by DNA viruses or other microbes, activates RIG-I signaling via an intermediate dsRNA generated by RNA polymerase III. The IRF-3-mediated apoptotic pathway, in addition to the gene induction pathway, significantly contributes to the host antiviral response.</div></div>
