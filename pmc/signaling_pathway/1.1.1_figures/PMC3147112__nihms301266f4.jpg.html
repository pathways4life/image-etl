Wt1CreERT2/+ Rosa26mTmG hearts were pulsed with Tam for 12 hours in vivo, then explanted and cultured in the presence of the indicated inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling. DKK1 and sFRP2 consistently blocked formation of GFP+ EPDCs. <b>B</b>. Differential expression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling components in Wt1KO (Wt1GFPCre/GFPCre) compared to Ctrl (Wt1GFPCre/+) FACS-purified epicardial cells. β-Catenin (Ctnnb1) was measured with unamplified RNA, n=10–12. Other genes were measured with amplified RNA, n=4–5. <b>C</b>. Cryosections of E13.5 heart stained for CTNNB1, CTNNB1 phosphorylated at Ser675 (ph-CTNNB1), or CTNNB1 lacking phorphorylation at Ser37 or Thr41 (unph-CTNNB1). GFP immunostaining marked epicardium and derivatives. In controls, CTNNB1 was expressed in epicardium (arrows) and myocardium. In mutant heart, CTNNB1 was unchanged in myocardium but decreased in epicardium (arrowheads). <b>D</b>. Downstream targets of Wnt/β-catenin signaling were downregulated in Wt1KO, consistent with decreased activity of this signaling pathway. Amplified RNA, n=4–5. <b>E</b>. Activity of the Batgal transgene, which expresses LacZ in response to canonical Wnt signaling, in control and Wt1KO epicardium. *, P &lt; 0.05. Scale bars: 10 μm (white), 100 μm (yellow).</div></div>
