From: Ephrin regulation of palate development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Two proposed models of ephrin-B reverse signaling in palatal EMT based on current evidence.</b> Pathway 1 places ephrin signaling downstream of Tgfß3 signaling such that Tgfß3 stimulates expression of EphBs and/or ephrin-Bs, leading to activation of PI3K signaling. In pathway 2, Tgfß3 and ephrin-B signaling act in parallel to stimulate PI3K together. Pathways 1 and 2 are not mutually exclusive.</div></div>
