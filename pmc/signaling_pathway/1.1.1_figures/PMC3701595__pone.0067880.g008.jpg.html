Activated AMPKα increases the expression and transcriptional activity of PPARα, thereby increasing the expression of lipolytic genes, including ACO, CPT1, CPT2, and L-FABP. AMPKα activation inhibits the expression and transcriptional activity of SREBP-1c and ChREBP, thereby reducing the expression of lipogenic genes, including ACC1, FAS, and SCD-1. In addition, activated AMPKα directly phosphorylates and inhibits ACC1. Consequently, acetic acid increases lipolysis and reduces lipid synthesis in bovine hepatocytes.</div></div>
