The FSH pathway page in NetPath displays the statistics of data in the FSH pathway reactions including the number of proteins, protein-protein interactions, enzyme-substrate reactions, translocation events and differentially regulated genes in normal/primary human cells. The complete list of these reactions is accessible through the specific links provided for each reaction. Brief comments are provided for reactions curated under reactions such as PPI, enzyme-substrate reactions and transport. Each of these molecules is linked to NetPath molecule page which is further linked to Entrez gene, HPRD [30], OMIM [31] and Swiss-Prot [32] identifiers. A list of curators/reviewers is provided in the FSH pathway page with the details of the Pathway Authority. A 'comments' tab is provided in the pathway page to invite queries and suggestions from the community as a means to keep the pathway updated and as error-free as possible.</div></div>
