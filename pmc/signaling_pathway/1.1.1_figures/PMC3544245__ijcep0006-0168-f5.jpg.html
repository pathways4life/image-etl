A and B. The mRNA expressions of both p38α and p38β isoforms were down-regulated by α-NF during adipogenesis; C. α-NF slightly suppressed total p38 protein expression but not reached significantly level; D. After 20 and 40 minutes of hormone cocktail administration, phosphorylation of p-p38(thr180/tyr182) was significantly induced and was substainly inhibited by α-NF.</div></div>
