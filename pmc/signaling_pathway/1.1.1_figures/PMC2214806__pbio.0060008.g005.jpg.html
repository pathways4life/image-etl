NF-κB reporter assays in HEK293 cells. Data are mean values of three independent experiments ± standard deviation.(B) The transferred LTB determines TRAF6-dependent NF-κB activation. NF-κB reporter assays in TRAF6–/– MEFs are shown. Where indicated (black bars), TRAF6 was co-transfected. Data are mean values of four independent experiments ± standard deviation; statistics: two-tailed Student's t-test.(C) Lack of apoptosis induction by LTB in the context of the TNFR1 signaling domain. Transient cell death assays in human BJAB B lymphocytes are shown. The NF-κB pathway was blocked by co-expression of domaint-negative I-κBα(S32/36A). Where indicated, the cells were incubated in the presence of 2 μM zVAD-fmk (zVAD), a pan-caspase inhibitor. PI, propidium iodide. Data are mean values of three independent experiments ± standard deviation.(D) Apoptosis induction by LMP1-TNFR1 is dependent on TRADD. Cell death assays in DG75 TRADD+/+ and DG75 TRADD–/– cells are shown. Data are mean values of three independent experiments ± standard deviation; statistics: two-tailed Student's t-Test.</div></div>
