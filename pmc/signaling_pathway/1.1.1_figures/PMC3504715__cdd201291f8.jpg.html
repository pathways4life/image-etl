(<b>a</b>) Model of CITED2/MYC/E2F3/p21CIP1 signaling. CITED2 expression is induced by TGF-α/EGFR through MYC. Elevated CITED2 levels further recruit p300 to the E2F3 promoter to enhance MYC-mediated transactivation, leading to increased G1/S cell cycle transition (left). TGF-β downregulates CITED2, and loss of CITED2 prevents MYC from interacting with HDAC1, causing activation of the p21CIP1 promoter and cellular quiescence (right). (<b>b</b>) Model of cytokine-induced homeostasis and neoplastic development of lung epithelial cells. Homeostasis of normal lung epithelial cells is intricately balanced by TGF-α/EGFR proliferation and TGF-β/TGFBR quiescence signaling, both of which are fine-tuned by CITED2 expression. Activation of MYC/CITED2/E2F3/p21CIP1 pathway by abnormal cytokine signaling such as EGFR mutation/amplification-activation and TGFBRII silencing contributes to neoplastic development of lung epithelial cells</div></div>
