(A,B) Phosphorylated ERK1/ERK2 were detected by Western blot and quantified using ImageJ. (A) Time course of induction with 2 μg/mL preclustered ephrin-B1-Fc in media containing 10% FBS resulted in two phases of ERK1/ERK2 activation. (B) In starvation conditions (media containing 0.2% FBS), an activation of ERK1/ERK2 was observed at 2 min, followed by decay. (C,D) Real-time QRT–PCR quantification of immediate early transcriptional targets of ephrin-B1 forward signaling in MEP cells. (C) Regulation of expression of immediate early targets shadows the activation of the ERK/MAPK signaling. QRT–PCR over a time course of forward signaling induction shows initial up-regulation, down-regulation by 1 h, and increase in expression by 2 h (relative mean normalized to GAPDH ± SD) (D) Inhibition of Ras–MAPK activation eliminates the induction of IEG transcriptional targets. Real-time QRT–PCR over a time course of forward signaling induction in the presence of 10 μM U0126 (relative mean normalized to GAPDH ± SD). (E) BrdU incorporation after 3 h of treatment with 2 μg/mL preclustered ephrin-B1-Fc indicates that cell proliferation is induced by ephrin-B1 forward signaling in media containing 10% FBS (n = 9, mean ± SEM; P &lt; 0.008) or 0.2% FBS (n = 9, mean ± SEM; P &lt; 0.006); this effect is eliminated when Ras–MAPK signaling is blocked by treatment with 10 μM U0126 (n = 9, mean ± SEM). (F) Model of ephrin-B1 regulation of palatal morphogenesis. Ephrin-B1+/− heterozygous females constitute mosaic expression of ephrin-B1 (red). Ephrin-B1 activates forward signaling, resulting in endocytosis and degradation of the EphB receptor. In ephrin-B1 mutant domains, relief of this feedback allows receptor up-regulation (green); several candidate mediators of this feedback were identified as phosphorylation targets of forward signaling (Rin1, Stam2, and Ap2β1). Activation of this forward signal also leads to the phosphorylation of several signaling adaptors (Shc1, Shb, and Dok1) that are capable of regulating ERK/MAPK. The transcriptional regulation of IEGs by activation of the ERK/MAPK may also play a role in feedback regulation of the pathway. Cell proliferation, which is critical for the outgrowth of the palatal shelves, is also dependent on signaling through ERK/MAPK.</div></div>
