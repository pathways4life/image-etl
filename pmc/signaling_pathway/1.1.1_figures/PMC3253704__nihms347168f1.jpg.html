From: Aberrant <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways in pancreatic cancer: A two compartment view. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic representation of prominent signaling pathways involved with PDAC tumoral compartment and stromal compartment crosstalk. Induction of some of these pathways by RAS activation is a contributing factor. The cells of the tumoral compartment can both respond to TGF-β pathway activation as well as produce ligand that can then act in a paracrine fashion to affect cells of the stromal compartment. Likewise, cells of the tumoral compartment can respond to Hh activation and also produced ligand to affect the surrounding stromal cells. Chemokines and growth factors produced by inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and PSCs can stimulate NF-κB signaling in cells of both compartments. Likewise, these cells can produce chemokines and growth factors to further stimulate NF-κB signaling in a paracrine manner. This schematic greatly simplifies the complexity of this crosstalk but highlights its importance in function of both cellular compartments.</div></div>
