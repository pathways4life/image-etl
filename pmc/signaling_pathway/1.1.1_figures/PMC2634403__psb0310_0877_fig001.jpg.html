High salinity reduces GA biosynthesis. GA represses both NTL8 transcription and NTL8 processing. However, it is likely that the NTL8-mediated signaling is not required under favorable growth conditions. It inhibits seed germination only when the surrounding conditions are unfavorable for plant propagation. NTL8 may function as a molecular link that incorporates environmental signals into the GA-mediated signaling pathway in seed germination.</div></div>
