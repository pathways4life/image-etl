Aldosterone stimulates H+-ATPase activity through a major pathway requiring GÎ±q proteins, phospholipase C, intracellular Ca2+, PKC, and ERK1/2. A second interlinked pathway involves cAMP and PKA. The PKA-dependent pathway is likely upstream of PKC and ERK1/2 because inhibition of this pathway blocks the cAMP/PKA-dependent stimulation of H+-ATPase activity. Chelation of Ca2+ may interfere at several stages because Ca2+ may be involved in stimulation of PKC isoforms as well as in the exocytic insertion of H+-ATPases into the membrane, which has been shown earlier to occur during stimulation of H+-ATPase activity (58, 75). Inhibitors and activators of signaling molecules used in this study are shown in italics.</div></div>
