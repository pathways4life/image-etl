(<b>A</b>) In Drosophila, the evidence suggests that a retrograde signal involving homologues of the BMP pathway regulates synaptic growth, assembly and maintenance by pathways related to either Smad or cytoskeleton regulators; (<b>B</b>) In vertebrates, spinal cord injury induces an increase of BMP ligands around the injury site. BMP receptors and Smad1 phosphorylation is also increased in spinal neurons, revealing the ability of BMP to transduce Smad-dependent signaling. However, the target genes induced by Smad pathways or the mechanisms involving local cytoskeletal rearrangement are unknown.</div></div>
