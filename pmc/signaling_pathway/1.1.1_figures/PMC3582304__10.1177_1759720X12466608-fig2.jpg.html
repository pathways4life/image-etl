In the presence of sclerostin or dickkopf (Dkk) proteins, the ligands cannot bind their receptors to activate the Wnt signaling. The inhibitory effects of sclerostin and Dkk proteins can be neutralized by their respective antibodies, thus activating the Wnt signaling pathway downstream. Secreted Frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) and Wif inhibit the Wnt signaling by binding the Wnt ligands, but SFRP inhibitors such as diphenylsulfonyl sulfonamide can inhibit SFRPs from binding the Wnt ligands. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) normally targets β catenin for degradation by phosphorylation. However, lithium or other pharmacological GSK3β-inhibiting compounds can inhibit the GSK3β activity, thus allowing β catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and the nucleus expressing the target genes. Chibby (Cby) is an endogenous antagonist, which interrupts the binding of β catenin to transcriptional factors T-cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (Lef-1).</div></div>
