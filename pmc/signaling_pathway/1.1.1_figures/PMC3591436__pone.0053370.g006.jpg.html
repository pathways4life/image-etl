Possible mechanisms of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 leading to claudin-5 degradation via the NF-κB <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>..  From: Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 Leads to Claudin-5 Degradation via the NF-?B <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in BALB/c Mice with Eosinophilic Meningoencephalitis Caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The activation of IκB-α and NF-κB could upregulate MMP-9 production in A. cantonensis-induced leukocytes. Blocking IκB-α and NF-κB signaling by MG132 could reduce MMP-9 production. Further, blocking MMP-9 activity by GM6001 could reduce claudin-5 degradation and blood-CSF barrier permeability during angiostrongyliasis meningoencephalitis. Therefore, we suggest that MMP-9 could cause claudin-5 degradation and promote leukocyte infiltration into CSF by the paracellular route during A. cantonensis infection in mouse choroid plexus.</div></div>
