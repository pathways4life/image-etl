From: Network Analysis of Neurodegenerative Disease Highlights a Role of Toll-Like Receptor <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Flow diagram representing the molecular interactions in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (from KEGG database). The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) pathway is enriched with connector proteins, labeled in red. TLRs act as primary sensors that detect a wide variety of microbial components and elicit innate immune responses. The connector proteins found in our study (TRAF6, NFκB, PI3K-AKT, ERK, IKKε, and CASP8) are mediators in the TLR signaling pathway which control the expression of an array of inflammatory cytokine genes.</div></div>
