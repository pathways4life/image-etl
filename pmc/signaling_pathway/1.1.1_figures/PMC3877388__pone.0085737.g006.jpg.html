From: Syndecan-1 (CD138) Modulates Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Stem Cell Properties via Regulation of LRP-6 and IL-6-Mediated STAT3 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">siRNA-mediated knockdown of Syndecan-1 expression results in decreased expression of IL-6, the IL-6R and the chemokine CCL20, possibly due to reduced activation of NFkB. Reduced expression of components of the IL-6 signaling pathway results in decreased constitutive activation of STAT3 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Low expression of the Wnt-coreceptor LRP-6 in Syndecan-1-deficient cells may reduce responsiveness to Wnt signaling. The attenuation of mutiple stemness-related signaling events results in a reduction of the SP and ALDH-activity, two surrogate parameters of stem cell activity. The reduction of the CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) phenotype may have implications for novel Syndecan-1-centered therapeutic approaches of basal-like breast cancer.</div></div>
