Mapping gene expression changes on the Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> revealed strong upregulation of PCP <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and downregulation of canonical <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>..  From: CAFET Algorithm Reveals Wnt/PCP Signature in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The three branches of Wnt signaling are shown â€“calcium (pink background), beta-catenin (green background), and PCP (blue background). Up/down arrows indicate overexpression and downregulation, respectively, in Group 1 samples. Genes whose expression change is consistent with canonical pathway inhibition and PCP pathway activation are colored red. Those genes promoting canonical signaling and inhibiting the PCP branch are colored green. Genes with no significant change in expression, or whose expression change has no selectivity between the canonical and non-canonical branches are colored white. The down-regulation of CAMK2D and PRKCA (dark blue) acts to inhibit Wnt Ca2+ signaling.</div></div>
