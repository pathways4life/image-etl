Angiogenic and cell proliferating signaling cascades are upregulated in RCC tumor cells. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other related growth factors secreted by tumor cells stimulate angiogenic signaling in the surrounding vascular endothelial cells. In response to growth factor signaling mediated through VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and KIT receptors, PI3-kinase and Ras effectors activate hypoxia pathway (HIF) transcription factors, which in turn switch on gene expression needed for angiogenesis and cell proliferation in endothelial cells. In addition to the angiogenic pathway, the Wnt pathway is also upregulated in RCC tumor cells.</div></div>
