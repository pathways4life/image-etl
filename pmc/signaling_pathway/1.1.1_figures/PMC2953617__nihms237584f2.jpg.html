From: The role of primary cilia in neuronal function. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">JS genes implicated in the Shh, Wnt, and PDGFα signaling pathway. ARL13B and INPP5E localize to the cilium, whereas AHI1 and CEP290 localize to the basal body. CEP290, a centrosomal protein, is involved in Rab8 contained vesicle transport and ciliogenesis through its interaction with PCM-1. The disruption of ARL13B causes defects in ciliary structure and Shh signaling. ARL13B is required for body axis formation, renal function, and neural tube patterning. INPP5E plays an essential role in stabilizing cilia in response to serum stimulation, possibly by controlling PDGFα signaling. AHI1 interacts with and facilitates β-catenin (β-Cat) accumulation in the nucleus to positively modulate Wnt signaling. Wnt/β-catenin signaling via AHI1 is essential for maintaining renal homeostasis.</div></div>
