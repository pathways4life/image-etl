Binding of Wnt to the FZD receptor induces Î²-catenin accumulation, which translocates to the nucleus to activate target gene transcription. Several transcription factors have been found crucial for osteoblast differentiation downstream of this signaling pathway, such as Runx2, Osterix, and ATF4. They are essential for differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into differentiated osteoblasts and also function in the transcription of osteoblast-specific genes.</div></div>
