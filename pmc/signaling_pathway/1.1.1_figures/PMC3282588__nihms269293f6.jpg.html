Embryos were injected and/or treated with reagents listed, fixed at stage 20-22, bisected and stained for co-injected lineage tracer (pink), then processed for Netrin ISH. Activated Notch signaling upregulates Netrin (B, F), while blockade of Shh signaling slightly reduces Netrin (C, G). Activation of Notch and blockade of Shh in the same embryo results in a Notch phenotype (D, H). Shh overexpression leads to a slight increase in FP (I), and blockade of Notch signaling leads to a decrease (J). Activation of Shh and blockade of Notch in the same embryo results in a Notch phenotype (K). Blockade of Notch signaling downstream of NICD with SDBM is able to rescue FP and notochord development to normal (L). Blockade (M, O) or activation (P) of both Notch and Shh signaling in the same embryo gives more severe phenotypes than perturbing either pathway alone.</div></div>
