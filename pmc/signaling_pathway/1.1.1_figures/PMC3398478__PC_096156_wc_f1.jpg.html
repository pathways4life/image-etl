Smk1 may be part of a fifth, yet undefined, pathway that regulates ascospore formation. Activation of MAPK cascades depends on transmembrane receptors that perceive extracellular cues and translate information to intracellular signaling components, including GTPases, GEFs, and PKs. Upstream regulators may be shared between distinct signaling pathways, and timely activation of a specific cascade must be tightly regulated. In some cases, signal specificity is achieved through the use of scaffolding proteins promoting interaction between suitable MAPK signaling components. Following activation, MAPKs phosphorylate an array of substrates, including TFs that induce a transcriptional shift controlling output responses. See text for more details on each signaling pathway. In light of this study, the acronym “Sce” (for S. cerevisiae) was added to the standard nomenclature of yeast MAPKs.</div></div>
