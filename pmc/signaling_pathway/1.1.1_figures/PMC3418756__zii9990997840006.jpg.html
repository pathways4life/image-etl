From: Genome-Wide Mapping of Cystitis Due to Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli in Mice Identifies a Unique Bladder Transcriptome That Signifies Pathogen-Specific Antimicrobial Defense against Urinary Tract Infection. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Immune activation in the GBS UTI transcriptome comprises prominent cytokine-cytokine receptor signaling (innateDB pathway number 604) (A) in which 12 genes were highly active (red circles; expression and significance cutoffs, 2.0 and 0.1). The pathway is illustrated according to subcellular localization and includes the total of 255 genes annotated in the pathway. The bladder transcriptome also includes chemokine signaling (innateDB pathway 4351) (B), with activation of the pathway occurring via 8 genes (red circles; Cxcl10, Cxcl9, and Stat2 are shown twice) among a total of 175 genes in the pathway.</div></div>
