From: Cholinergic Neural Signals to the Spleen Down-Regulate Leukocyte Trafficking via CD11b. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for the role of the spleen in regulating leukocyte trafficking via cholinergic signaling. Collectively, our findings reveal a centralized pathway for controlling leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation via modulation of neutrophil CD11b levels through a spleen-dependent neural cholinergic signaling pathway. This pathway can be manipulated by cholinergic stimulation via electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve or by pharmacological cholinergic agonists to attenuate excess leukocyte accumulation at the site of inflammation and reduce tissue damage.</div></div>
