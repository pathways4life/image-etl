(A)</b> shows a small part of the MAPK signaling pathway from KEGG. This pathway shows the location of various genes or gene products (inside the cell, outside of it, or in the membrane), what gene interacts with what other gene(s), the type of each interaction (activation, repression, phosphorylation, etc.), the direction of the signal propagation, and potentially many other things (e.g., complex formation, etc.). <b>(B)</b> presents the same part of the same pathway as a gene set (no interactions). The gene set has lost all the structure and the additional information captured by the original pathway. This comparison shows how much important knowledge existent in pathway database is ignored when pathways are treated as simple gene sets.</div></div>
