RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with 200 ng/ml LPS in the absence or presence of aromadendrin. Western blot analysis was then performed to evaluate the activation of MAP kinase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. LPSinduced phosphorylation of JNK was significantly attenuated with aromadendrin treatment, but phosphorylation of ERK and p38 was not decreased with aromadendrin treatment, suggesting that JNK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> might play a key role in the LPS-induced overactivation of RAW 264.7 cells. Î²-Actin was used as an internal control. Images are representative of three independent experiments that shows reproducible results. ARD stands for aromadendrin..
