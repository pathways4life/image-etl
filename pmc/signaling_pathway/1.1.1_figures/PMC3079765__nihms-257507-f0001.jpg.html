A critical target of that pathway is d4eBP whose negative regulation in cardiac tissue is required for normal cardiac senescence to occur (red heart). In our model cardiac aging can be delayed when d4eBP function is maintained, either by increasing dFOXO expression or by reducing insulin-TOR pathway activation (green heart).</div></div>
