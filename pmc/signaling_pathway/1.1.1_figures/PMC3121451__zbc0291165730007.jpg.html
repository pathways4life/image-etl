From: A Novel Specificity Protein 1 (SP1)-like Gene Regulating Protein Kinase C-1 (Pkc1)-dependent Cell Wall Integrity and Virulence Factors in Cryptococcus neoformans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Role of Sp1 in the Pkc1 signaling pathway of C. neoformans.</b> Pkc1 phosphorylates a member of the MAPK signaling pathway, Bck1, with subsequent phosphorylation of Mkk2 and the downstream component Mpk1 to mediate cell wall integrity, growth at high temperature, and virulence. Pkc1 also regulates the transcription factor Sp1 by phosphorylation, leading to activation by nuclear translocation as well as by transcriptional mechanisms, leading to regulation of osmoresistance, cell wall integrity, and virulence in parallel with the MAPK pathway as well as a unique pathway leading to resistance to nitrosative stress, capsule production, and caspofungin resistance. Laccase (Lac1) is regulated by Pkc1 via an unknown pathway. DAG, diacylglycerol. Adapted from Gerik et al. (16).</div></div>
