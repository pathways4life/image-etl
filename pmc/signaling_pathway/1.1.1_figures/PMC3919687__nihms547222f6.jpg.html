Pathways were generated by Ingenuity Pathway analysis. (A) Pathway analysis of Th2 differentiation. (B) IL-10 Signaling and IL-4RÎ± expression, and (C) IL-4 signaling and production. Adjacent to each step of the pathway are the gene profile plots of old and young CD4+ T cells. Axis labels the same as in Fig. 2.</div></div>
