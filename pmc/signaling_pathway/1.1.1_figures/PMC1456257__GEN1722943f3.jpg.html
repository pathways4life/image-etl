Note that for purposes of clarity, Gαq, Gαs, and Gαo are at times referred to as Gq, Gs, and Go in this and subsequent figures. (A) unc-31 null mutants look similar to mutants that lack a neuronal Gαs pathway when viewed on culture plates through a stereomicroscope. Images compare a typical N2 (wild-type) animal with a typical unc-31(e928) null mutant and a mutant that lacks a neuronal Gαs pathway. The latter's genotype is acy-1(pk1279); ceEx108 [myo-3∷acy-1(+) cDNA], which expresses acy-1 (adenylyl cyclase) only in muscle cells and thus is null for acy-1 in the nervous system (Reynolds et al. 2005). All three animals are feeding in a lawn of bacteria. Note the similar straight posture associated with the paralysis of the unc-31 and neuronal Gαs pathway null mutants. The image “Mutant lacking a neuronal Gαs pathway” is reprinted with permission from Reynolds et al. (2005) for comparison. (B) unc-31 and neuronal Gαs pathway null mutants exhibit a similar degree of paralysis. Shown are the mean locomotion rates, expressed as body bends per minute, of the indicated strains. An egl-30 (Gαq) reduction-of-function mutant (ad805) (Brundage et al. 1996) that is paralyzed to a similar extent as mutants lacking a neuronal Gαs pathway or UNC-31 is shown for comparison. unc-31 null mutants are only slightly less paralyzed than animals that lack a neuronal Gαs pathway. The bar on the right demonstrates that a transgenic array containing the unc-31 (+) cDNA expressed in the nervous system fully rescues the locomotion defect of the unc-31(e928) null. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean for populations of 10 animals. Transgenic arrays are ceEx108 [myo-3∷acy-1(+) cDNA (expressed only in muscle)] and ceEx117 [rab-3∷unc-31(+) cDNA (expressed only in the nervous system)]. The value for acy-1(pk1279); ceEx108 is reprinted with permission from Reynolds et al. (2005) for comparison. (C) unc-31 and neuronal Gαs pathway null mutants respond normally to the cholinergic agonist levamisole. The graph depicts the contraction of individual animals after a 20-min exposure to various concentrations of levamisole. Error bars represent the standard errors for six individual animals at each concentration. acy-1(pk1279); ceEx108 (a transgenic muscle-rescued acy-1 null mutant) was used as the neuronal Gαs pathway null. Note that the levamisole sensitivity of unc-31(e928) is indistinguishable from wild type, while the neuronal Gαs pathway null appears only slightly hypersensitive to levamisole (although this is not statistically significant at any concentration). We did not investigate the extent to which overexpression of the acy-1(+) transgene cDNA in muscle may have contributed to the slight levamisole hypersensitivity, as has been previously shown to occur with muscle-specific expression of acy-1(gf) (Schade et al. 2005). Statistical significance tests used the unpaired t-test with Welch correction, with the level of statistical significance set at P = 0.05. The data for N2 and the neuronal Gs pathway null are reprinted with permission from Reynolds et al. (2005) for comparison and were generated as part of the same experiment with the unc-31 null. (D) unc-31 and neuronal Gαs pathway null mutants exhibit near-normal aldicarb sensitivity. Shown are the population growth rates of strains on various concentrations of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb. One hundred percent represents the number of progeny produced from a starting population of L1 larvae over a 96-hr period in the absence of aldicarb. Curves are representative of duplicate experiments. Complete genotypes are as follows: unc-31 null, unc-31(e928); Gαq reduction-of-function mutant, egl-30(ad805) (Brundage et al. 1996); and neuronal Gs pathway null, acy-1(pk1279); ceEx108 (a transgenic muscle-rescued acy-1 null mutant) (Reynolds et al. 2005). The data for N2, egl-30(ad805), and the neuronal Gs pathway null are reprinted with permission from Reynolds et al. (2005) for comparison and were generated as part of the same experiment with the unc-31 null.</div></div>
