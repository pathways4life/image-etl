Colored blocks represent the individual LSI implicit correlation of the specific protein (vertically organized on left of heatmap: 1–2524 – see Table S20) with the respective KEGG term (1-Regulation of actin cytoskeleton, 2-Chemokine signaling, 3-Alzheimer's disease, 4-Focal adhesion, 5-MAPK signaling, 6-Gap junction, 7-GnRH signaling, 8-Long term potentiation, 9-Notch signaling, 10-VEGF signaling, 11-p53 signaling, 12-Calcium signaling). The number of KEGG signaling pathway correlations for each protein is indicated by the color of the respective heatmap blocks (9 correlations-red; 8 correlations-orange; 7 correlations-yellow; 6 correlations-green; 5 correlations-light blue; 4 correlations-dark blue; 3 correlations-purple; 2 correlations-grey). (B) Mean ± SEM for the total implicitly-correlating proteins for each of the 12 input KEGG signaling pathways. (C) Box and whisker plot with 1–99% statistical cut-offs (GraphPad Prism) of the number of specific correlations to KEGG pathways each protein possessed. Twelve proteins demonstrated a statistically-significantly greater number of KEGG pathway correlations compared to the total protein mean number of correlations (*** = p&lt;0.001). (D) Expanded heatmap identification of specific proteins possessing a significantly greater number of KEGG pathway correlations compared to the mean number of KEGG pathway correlations for all implicit proteins. (E) Mean ± SEM of LSI correlation scores (across all 9 correlations) for Grit and GIT2.</div></div>
