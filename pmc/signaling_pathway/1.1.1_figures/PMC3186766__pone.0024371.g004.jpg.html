From: Gene Expression Analysis in the Thalamus and Cerebrum of Horses Experimentally Infected with West Nile Virus. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) The diagrams represent the different methods of IL-15 production. Green represents downregulation of pertinent molecules, red represents upregulation of pertinent molecules. WNV induces upregulation of the production of IL-15. (B) Red represents upregulation of gene expression, green represents down-regulation of gene expression. The JAK/STAT portion of the pathway is upregulated during viral infection, demonstrating an innate immune response. However, the SOCS3 molecule is also upregulated, indicating that infection with the virus may lead to subsequent suppression of the JAK/STAT pathway and evasion of the innate immune response.
