Hypothetical network visualizing the proposed difference maintaining and regulating steroidogenesis and androstenone biosynthesis in high and low androstenone boars..  From: <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Based Analysis of Genes and Interactions Influencing Porcine Testis Samples from Boars with Divergent Androstenone Content in Back Fat. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Legend: Circular nodes: genes, hexagonal nodes: enriched pathways, diamond nodes: pathways that might be involved in steroidogenesis, but not found in results, rectangular nodes: metabolites from pathways. In high androstenone samples, steroidogenesis was activated by cAMP-PKA signaling, lipid peroxidation activity of ROS was inhibited by metabolites from glutathione metabolism pathway and de novo synthesis of cholesterol as a result of an active fatty acid metabolism activity might have boosted steroidogenesis and androstenone synthesis. In low androstenone samples, weak cAMP-PKC signaling of steroidogenesis and inhibition of steroidogenesis by ceramides synthesized from sphnigolipid metabolim pathway might have lead to weak steroidogenesis and hence, low androstenone synthesis.</div></div>
