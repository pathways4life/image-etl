Aberrations activating the pathway, i.e. activating mutations (star), inactivating mutation of the repressor NF1 (X), fusions proteins and unknown alterations (?), are indicated with their frequencies in cerebellar and non-cerebellar PAs. Activation of this signaling pathway can induce various cellular responses like cell growth, differentiation, and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). <b>b</b> The various MAPK pathway alterations are unevenly distributed in tumors of different locations. NF1 mutation is mainly seen in optic pathway gliomas but also occasionally in other locations. Tumors in other brain regions are dominated by RAF activation, with fusions occurring primarily in cerebellar tumors and mutations in supratentorial PAs. For the more infrequent hits, no prevalent locations can be given</div></div>
