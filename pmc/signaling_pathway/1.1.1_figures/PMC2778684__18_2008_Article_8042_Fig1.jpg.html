There are at least three different intracellular Wnt signaling transduction pathways. These pathways are the Wnt/CatnB pathway (canonical pathway), the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway and the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway. Both the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway and the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway are combined as the non-canonical pathway, which involve the downstream members calmodulin kinase II (Cam-KII), protein kinase C (PKC) and c-jun kinase (JNK).
