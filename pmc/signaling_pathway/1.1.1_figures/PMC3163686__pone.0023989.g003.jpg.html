ST2L heterodimerizes with Mal and MyD88 by occupying their receptor-adapter and adapter-adapter interacting sites, thereby preventing the engagement of signaling adapters, Mal and MyD88, into the post-receptor signaling complex (TLR4-Mal-MyD88 hexamer) and thus exhibiting its inhibitory effect. Full-length structure of TLR4 is colored in orchid. The TIR domains of ST2L, Mal and MyD88 are colored in hot pink, coral and gold, respectively. The available TLR4 ECD structure coordinates along with its ligand was taken from the PDB (3FXI). The red color dotted line along with the bar represents inhibition symbol.</div></div>
