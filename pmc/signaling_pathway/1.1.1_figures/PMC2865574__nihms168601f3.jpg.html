To resolve these divergent responses to activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, we have developed a model in which β-catenin/CBP-mediated transcription is critical for the maintenance of potency, whereas a switch to β-catenin/p300-mediated transcription is the first critical step to initiate differentiation. Hence the balance between CBP and p300-mediated β-catenin transcription regulates the balance between maintenance of potency and the initiation of commitment to differentiate. The interaction of β-catenin with either CBP or p300 can be modulated by two small molecules, respectively ICG-001 and IQ-1, identified in our laboratory. As a consequence, these small molecules regulate Wnt signaling pathway outcomes.</div></div>
