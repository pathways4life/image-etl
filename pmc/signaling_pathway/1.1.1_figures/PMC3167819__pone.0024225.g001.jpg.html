Wnt signaling pathway also down-regulates E-cadherins. Dkk1 and E-cadherins inhibit Wnt signaling pathway. Activation of Notch signaling pathway by DSL up-regulates Hes expression, which inhibits Df. Pf, proliferation factor; Df, Differentiation factors; CP, Pf threshold; CM, Df threshold; DSL, Delta, Serrate, Lag-2; Dkk1, Dickkopf1 protein. Pale blue – Wnt protein; purple – Notch pathway protein; green arrow – activation; grey arrow – inhibition; dashed arrow – threshold-dependent effect.</div></div>
