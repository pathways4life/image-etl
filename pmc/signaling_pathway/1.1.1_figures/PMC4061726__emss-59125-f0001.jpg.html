In the absence of Wnt ligand (‘Wnt off’), β-cat is targeted for proteolytic degradation by the APC/GSK-3β destruction complex. The proteins Norrin and R-spondin (Rspo) are unrelated to Wnt and act as Wnt agonists, whereas Dkk1, Wif, and sFRPs act as antagonists. (<b>B</b>) In noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, the binding of Wnts promotes Fzd-mediated activation of G proteins, leading to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and consequent activation of Ca2+-dependent effector molecules. Several Ca2+-sensitive targets, i.e. PKC, CamKII, and calcineurin, have been identified downstream of the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. Targets of the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway appear to interact with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway at multiple points. Additionally, Fzd receptors in association with Kny, Ror2, or Ryk receptors can activate JNK, promoting target gene expression through AP-1. In noncanonical Wnt/PCP pathway, the binding of Wnts activates RhoA/B, Cdc42, or Rac1. Dvl activates Rac1, which can activate JNK to signal through the NFAT pathway.</div></div>
