Biotinylated protein lysates were added to microscope slide chambers and fluorescence from Cy3-streptavidin was measured with the Axon GenePix 400A microarray scanner. B, the extent of protein phosphorylation (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) was normalized within each slide and compared between untreated control and cells treated with 10 nm CCL5 for 10 min. The data are represented as fold CCL5-induction relative to untreated controls. Phosphorylated signaling intermediates associated with metabolism are indicated (red arrows).</div></div>
