DMBA combined with TPA treatment disturbed the homeostasis of SGs and induced SN development during which HFSCs were activated and possibly induced to migrate towards SNs. And Wnt10b/Î²-catenin signaling pathway was activated to promote proliferation and differentiation of HFSCs in SNs.</div></div>
