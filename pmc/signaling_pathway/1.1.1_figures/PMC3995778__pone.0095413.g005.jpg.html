Black arrows denote direct molecular interaction or relation between gene products (green squares) or other types of molecules (unfilled circles), while black arrows with dashed lines denote an indirect effect between the each node. The relationship with other KEGG pathways is shown with the presence of white round rectangles. Gene symbols in components belonging to Meta-GW and META-GATES SN1 are denoted in red.</div></div>
