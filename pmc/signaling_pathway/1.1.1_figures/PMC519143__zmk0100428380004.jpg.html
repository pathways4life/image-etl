From: Transcription Profiling of Cyclic AMP <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Candida albicans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of the C. albicans cAMP signaling pathway. The schematic representation shows the role of three components of the cAMP pathway: Ras1p, Cdc35p, and Efg1p. The model proposes that Ras1p is a primary regulator of adenylyl cyclase but that there are other regulators of this pathway because the loss of Ras1p modulates only a subset of genes affected by the loss of Cdc35p, and Ras1p defective strains can still produce pseudohyphae. It appears that all three components are involved in the morphogenetic switch, but the cAMP pathway mediates regulation of other cellular processes independent of Efg1p, and these other targets of the cAMP pathway may or may not be regulated through PKA. In addition, we suggest that Efg1p also exerts effects on the transcription of genes outside the cAMP regulatory circuit. The asterisk (*) shows that the cell wall processes affected by cAMP and Efg1 are different.</div></div>
