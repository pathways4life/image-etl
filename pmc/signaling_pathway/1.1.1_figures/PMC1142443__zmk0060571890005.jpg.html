From: The Conserved Mec1/Rad53 Nuclear Checkpoint <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Regulates Mitochondrial DNA Copy Number in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for how signaling via the Mec1/Rad53 pathway influences mtDNA copy number. It is established that the Mec1/Rad53 pathway is responsive to nuclear DNA damage, nuclear replication stress, and S-phase signals that result in increased dNTPs needed to allow replication and repair to proceed. Based on the present study, we propose that signaling through this pathway can also regulate mtDNA copy number, primarily (although not necessarily exclusively; see Discussion) through changes in RNR activity and up-regulation or alteration of cellular dNTP pools. Arrows denote points in the pathway that are activated by the indicated stimulus (for example, deletion of SML1 results in increased activity of RNR). Several conditions tested in this work that resulted in increased mtDNA copy number and how they influence this pathway are shown, including deletion of RRM3 (rrm3Δ) or SML1 (sml1Δ) and overexpression of RNR1. Mitochondrial Pif1p is drawn at the end of this pathway because its petite-induction phenotype is rescued by overexpression of RNR1 (O'Rourke et al., 2005), deletion of RRM3 (O'Rourke et al., 2005), or deletion of SML1 (Table 1), indicating that a process it is involved in is responsive to alterations in dNTP pools. Finally, Abf2p is shown as a separate pathway that can increase mtDNA copy number. That upstream signals which regulate the abundance (or activity) of Abf2p to regulate mtDNA copy number are currently unknown is indicated by a question mark.</div></div>
