From: A role for PDGF <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in expansion of the extra-embryonic endoderm lineage of the mouse blastocyst. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Model for the role of PDGF signaling in the PrE lineage of the mouse blastocyst.</b> Early mouse development is characterized by progressive lineage restriction ensuring the segregation of the ICM cells (gray) into epiblast (EPI, red) and primitive endoderm (PrE, blue). XEN cells are derived from the PrE of the blastocyst. GATA6, which is considered a key regulator of PrE identity, may control the expression of genes, including Gata4 and Pdgfra. The PDGF pathway exerts a mitogenic effect through MEK/PKC signaling and promotes in vivo and ex vivo PrE lineage expansion and XEN cell establishment.</div></div>
