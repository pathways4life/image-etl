Targeted Cancer Therapy. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b> Inhibition of TGF-β signaling pathway.</b> The TGF-β signaling pathway is often elevated in human tumors, and thus a clinical target. This has led to the development of a range of anti-TGF-β-signaling drugs for cancer therapy. The four major classes of TGF-β inhibitors include ligand traps (e.g. 1D11 or Fresolimumab), antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) like Trabedersen, small molecule receptor kinase inhibitors such as LY2109761 or LY2157299, and peptide aptamers (e.g. Trx-SARA).</div></div>
