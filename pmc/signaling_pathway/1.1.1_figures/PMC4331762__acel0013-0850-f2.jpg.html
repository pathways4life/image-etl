(A) Venn diagram showing the common target genes of the identified miRNAs. The complete lists of all putative common targets are reported in Table S1. (B) Putative role of the target genes in insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. (C) Gene expression of potential common miR-targets with significant role in the insulin/IGF-1 pathway in skeletal muscle of postmenopausal women. Gene expression was measured by qPCR. (D) Western blot analyses of target proteins normalized against GAPDH. Protein levels were analyzed by densitometry and normalized against GAPDH expression. (E) Representative Western blot images from three twin pairs always presenting first the nonuser followed with her HRT-using co-twin. P values are from paired-samples t-test. *P â‰¤ 0.05.</div></div>
