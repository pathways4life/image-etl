Transducer: RNA-based controller responsive to an environmental signal; modulator: promoter that controls level and mode of expression (feedback, non-feedback); pathway regulator: protein that modulates pathway activity. <b>(B)</b> Diagram of molecular network diverters reshaping native signaling networks in response to environmental signals. <b>(C)</b> Schematic of the yeast mating pathway. Pheromone (Î±-factor) binds to a transmembrane receptor (Ste2), where the signal is relayed through G-proteins (Ste4), an adaptor protein (Ste50), and a scaffold (Ste5)-bound three-tiered MAPK cascade. Phosphorylated Fus3 (dephosphorylated by Msg5) is translocated to the nucleus, resulting in activation of mating genes. Pathway activity and mating response are monitored through a pFUS1-GFP reporter and pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest, respectively.</div></div>
