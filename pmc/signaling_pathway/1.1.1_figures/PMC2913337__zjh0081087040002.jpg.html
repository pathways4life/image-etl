From: Role of Cripto-1 in Stem Cell Maintenance and Malignant Progression. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Cross talk of the Nodal/Cripto-1 signaling pathway with Wnt, hypoxia, Notch, Oct-4, and Nanog signaling pathways. Activated Smad-2/Smad-3/Smad-4 complex can bind to specific TGF-β binding elements within the Cripto-1 promoter and regulate Cripto-1 gene expression. Wnt signaling pathway: Cripto-1 is a downstream target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin canonical pathway. Non-canonical Wnt11 can also bind to Cripto-1 and, in a complex with Frizzled 7 (Fzd7) and Glypican-4, induces β-catenin activation. Hypoxia: Hypoxia through HIF-1α directly regulates Cripto-1 expression in ES cells through binding to specific HREs within the Cripto-1 promoter. ES cells specific transcription factors: Oct-4 and Nanog directly regulate Cripto-1 expression in ES cells by binding to the Cripto-1 promoter. Notch signaling pathway: Cripto-1 directly interacts with Notch in ER/Golgi membranes and enhances cleavage of the Notch extracellular domain, potentiating the Notch ligand-activated signal. Nodal–independent Cripto-1 signaling pathway: Cripto-1, independently of Nodal, binds to Glypican-1 and induces activation of c-Src/MAPK/AKT, leading to cell motility and EMT. TBE: TCF/LEF binding elements; HRE: hypoxia binding elements; SBE: Smad binding elements; CBP: CREB binding protein; TCF/LEF: T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor. EMT indicates epithelial to mesenchymal transition; Notch ICD, Notch intracellular domain; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GDF, Growth and Differentiation Factor; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; and MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase.</div></div>
