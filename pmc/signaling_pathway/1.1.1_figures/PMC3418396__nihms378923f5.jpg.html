(<b>A</b>) Co-immunoprecipitation of SRPK1 and SRPK2 with Hsp70 and Hsp90 along with their co-chaperones in the presence of serum. (<b>B</b>) EGF-induced release of Hsp70 and its co-chaperone Hsp40 from SRPKs while enhanced the association of the splicing kinases with Hsp90 and its co-chaperone Aha1. (<b>C</b>) The differential interaction of SRPKs with heat shock proteins required the activation of the PI3K pathway. (<b>D</b>-<b>F</b>) EGF induced the interaction of SRPKs with 14-3-3β. Both SRPKs showed similar association in proliferating HEK293T cells (D). Interestingly, SRPK2 seems to be more inducible than SRPK1 in association with 14-3-3β in response to EGF signaling (E). Increased 14-3-3β was able to progressively suppress the interaction of SRPKs with both Hsp70 and Hsp90 in EGF-treated cells (F).</div></div>
