(A) The effects on locomotion rate caused by activating the Gαs pathway can be largely blocked by knocking out the Gαq synaptic vesicle priming pathway. Comparison of the mean locomotion rates of strains is shown in an egl-30(+) background (first set of bars) and an egl-30(ad810) null mutant background (second set of bars). Arrows point out the egl-30 null single mutant and double mutants containing the egl-30 null mutation in combination with mutations that activate acy-1 or PKA. Note that the acy-1 gain-of-function mutation causes a small, but significant, improvement to the locomotion rate of the egl-30 null; however, this amounts to only ∼2% of the acy-1 gain-of-function single mutant (shown in the left set of bars). In comparison, the locomotion rate of the egl-30 null is completely unaffected by the kin-2 mutation (which hyperactivates protein kinase A), yet the paralysis of this double mutant can still be completely rescued with phorbol esters (last bar; yellow). The values of the two bars with asterisks are 0.024 body bends/minute for egl-30(ad810) and 0.025 body bends/minute for egl-30(ad810); kin-2(ce179). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean for populations of 10 early larval stage animals. (B) Mutations or conditions that activate the Gαq pathway only partially suppress the paralysis caused by a block of the Gαs pathway. Comparison of the mean locomotion rates of strains in an acy-1(+) background (first set of bars) and an acy-1(pk1279) null mutant background (second set of bars) is shown. Arrows point out the acy-1 null single mutant and double mutants containing the acy-1 null mutation in combination with various mutations that activate the Gαq pathway or in combination with phorbol esters, which is the last bar. Note that all of the mutations that activate the Gαq pathway and even phorbol esters, which strongly suppress the more paralyzed egl-30 null, really only partially suppress the acy-1 null. The photograph shows the tightly knotted posture in which all of these double mutants (but the not the acy-1 null single mutant) spend about two-thirds of their time. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean for populations of 10 early larval stage animals. (C) The neuronal Gαs pathway is required for the Gαq pathway (and the DAG that it produces) to properly exert its effects. Comparison of the mean locomotion rates of strains in an acy-1(+) background (first set of bars) and a muscle-rescued acy-1(pk1279) null mutant background (second set of bars) is shown. These animals are null for acy-1 in their nervous system, but they contain the ceEx108 [myo-3::acy-1(+) cDNA] transgene that rescues acy-1 in muscle cells and also partially rescues the larval lethality caused by the acy-1 null mutation. Arrows point out the muscle-rescued acy-1 null single mutant and double mutants containing the muscle-rescued acy-1 null mutation in combination with a strong egl-30(gf) mutation that activates the Gαq pathway or in combination with phorbol esters. Note that both of these conditions only partially suppress paralysis of the acy-1 null. The photographs show the tightly knotted posture that dominates as a consequence of activating the Gαq pathway in the absence of a neuronal Gαs pathway. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean for populations of 10 early larval stage animals.
