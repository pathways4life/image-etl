Results in Figure 3 showed that proteins on looping motifs are mainly from cancer and correlated signal pathways, in other words, motifs with loop structure are enriched in 14 types of carcinomatosis and related signaling pathways, such as cell cycle signaling pathway and immune system signaling pathways.</div></div>
