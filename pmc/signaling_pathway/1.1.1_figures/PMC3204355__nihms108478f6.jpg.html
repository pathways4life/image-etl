From: Caspase-, cathepsin-, and PERK-dependent regulation of MDA-7/IL-24-induced cell killing in primary human glioma cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">GST-MDA-7 causes cell killing by promoting PERK-dependent vacuolization and JNK pathway activation in transformed cells. <b>A,</b> U251 cells were plated and 12 h after plating infected at a multiplicity of infection of 50 to express no gene or HSP70. Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were treated with GST or GST-MDA-7 (100 nmol/L). Forty-eight hours after GST-MDA-7 exposure, the viability of the U251 cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion assay and by Annexin V/PI staining (Â±SE; n = 2; #, P &lt; 0.05, less than value in CMV-infected cells). <b>B,</b> treatment of transformed cells with GST-MDA-7 causes PERK-dependent activation of the JNK pathway and PERK-dependent inactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway. JNK pathway signaling plays a key role in the activation of caspase-2 and caspase-4 and cathepsin B; cathepsin B promotes the activation of the BH3 domain protein BID. JNK pathway signaling also activates BAX. Inactivation of ERK1/2 promotes activation of BAD and BIM. Thus, GST-MDA-7, via PERK signaling, promotes activation of at least four BH3 domain proteins, which cause mitochondrial dysfunction and promote cell killing.</div></div>
