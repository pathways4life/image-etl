Total RNA was extracted from spleens of fish infected with A. hydrophila or injected with 0.9% NaCl. Real-time PCR was used to validate gene expression changes in the TLR pathway <b>(A)</b>, cytokines <b>(B)</b>, the MAPK signaling pathway <b>(C)</b>, and the TCR signaling pathway <b>(D)</b>. Increases and decreases in relative levels of transcripts with respect to the control Î²-actin gene are shown. For each gene, the black bar indicates the gene expression ratio of fish injected with 0.9% NaCl and is defined as 1; the grey bar indicates the expression ratio of fish infected with A. hydrophila, with associated standard error bars. Statistical significance of the relative expression ratio is indicated (*, P &lt; 0.01).</div></div>
