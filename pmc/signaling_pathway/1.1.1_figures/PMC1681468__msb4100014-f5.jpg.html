(<b>A</b>) Precise association states between EGFR and adaptors. Three adaptor proteins, Shc, Grb2, and Gab1, bind to the activated EGFR via its autophosphorylated tyrosine residues. Shc binds to activated EGFR and is phosphorylated on its tyrosine 317. Grb2 binds to activated EGFR either directly or via Shc bound to activated EGFR. Gab1 also binds to activated EGFR either directly or via Grb2 bound to activated EGFR, and is phosphorylated on its tyrosine 446, 472, and 589. (<b>B</b>) The same signaling pathway as in panel A using an 'address' such as 'Grb2@EGFR.Y1068/1086P', thereby achieving a presentation of the pathway details. EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; Gab, GRB2-associated binding protein; Grb, growth factor receptor-bound protein; Shc, Src homology 2 domain containing transforming protein.</div></div>
