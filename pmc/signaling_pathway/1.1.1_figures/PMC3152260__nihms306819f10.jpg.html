From: Opposing Actions of Insulin and Arsenite Converge on PKC? to Alter Keratinocyte Proliferative Potential and Differentiation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model illustrating interrelations of insulin, PKCδ and arsenite. Activation of the insulin/IGF receptor pathway appears to suppress EGFR signaling, an action prevented by arsenite. Insulin/IGFR signaling also stimulates the PI3-kinase pathway, including mTOR signaling. These pathways converge on PKCδ, a critical determinant of cell state. Arsenite and PI3-kinase or mTOR inhibitor cotreatment thus has an additive response in maintaining proliferative potential and yields PKCδ levels equivalent to insulin deprivation. Arrows indicate activation, and bars indicate suppression. Chemical inhibitors are in italics.</div></div>
