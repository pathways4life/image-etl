Protein members of the JAK-STAT pathway are color coded with respect to fold change in differential phosphorylation. Red indicates increased phosphorylation, green indicates decreased phosphorylation, and white indicates no change. (A) Differential phosphorylation of JAK-STAT intermediates following IFN-γ in bovine monocytes. (B) Relative degrees of phosphorylation of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected versus uninfected bovine monocytes following IFN-γ stimulation. Diagrams were produced using the cytoscape visualization option of InnateDB.</div></div>
