Common Mechanisms Promoting PH Due to Hemodynamic Stress May Rely upon the Intersecting BMPR-II and Serotoninergic Pathways.  From: Pulmonary Vascular Disease Related to Hemodynamic Stress in the Pulmonary Circulation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In the serotoninergic pathway, both genetic predisposition and specific exogenous stimuli lead to vessel remodeling via increased serotonin levels and signaling activity. In the BMPR-II pathway, genetic predisposition (such as heterozygous loss-of-function +/âˆ’ BMPR2 mutations) and, perhaps, exogenous stimuli lead to decreased receptor expression, alteration of downstream signaling, and resulting vessel remodeling. Additional pathogenic mechanisms may upregulate the angiopoietin-1/Tie2 receptor pathway with resulting repression of BMPR-1A function and alteration of BMPR-II signaling. Interestingly, serotonin can directly upregulate angiopoietin-1 and can modulate downstream Smad function, thereby influencing the BMP signaling cascade. This functional intersection has yet to be fully described, but may represent a common, unifying mechanism of pathogenesis. The precise details of how hemodynamic stressors regulate these pathways are under investigation. This figure is reproduced with modifications (73).</div></div>
