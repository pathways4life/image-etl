ELISA detection shows that MSCs and rm-Shh significantly decreased TGF-β1 expression in cultured astrocytes. (<b>A</b>) The Shh signaling pathway inhibitor cyclopamine increased TGF-β1 level in astrocytes cocultured with MSCs. (<b>B</b>) Exogenous addition of rh-TGF-β1 significantly increased PAI-1 expression in astrocytes, and the TGF-β activity neutralizer TGF-β1 LAP specifically downregulated the PAI-1 expression. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, compared with normal cultured astrocytes; #P&lt;0.05, compared with MSC treatment; ^P&lt;0.05 compared with TGF-β1 treatment. C: control (normal cultured astrocytes); L: LAP treatment; T: TGF-β1 treatment; T+L: TGF-β1 and LAP treatment; Shh: rm-Shh treatment; MSCs: MSC treatment. MSC, mesenchymal stromal cell; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; rm-Shh, recombinant mouse Shh; Shh, sonic hedgehog; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</div></div>
