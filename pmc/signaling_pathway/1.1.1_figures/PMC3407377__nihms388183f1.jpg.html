This is followed by activation of intracellular signaling mediators of TGF-β1. The canonical Smad pathway involves activation of Smad2/3 through recruitment and phosphorylation by activated TβRI, and requires kinase activity of TβRI. Smad2/3 is then released from the receptor complex to interact with Smad4 to transmit TGF-β1 signals. TGF-β1 also induces various non-Smad signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT, Rho-like GTPases, and the MAPKs.</div></div>
