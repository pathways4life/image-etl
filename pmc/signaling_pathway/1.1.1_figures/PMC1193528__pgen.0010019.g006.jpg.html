Premature Stop Codons Were Identified in the uki and lep Mutant in Hip and Ptc2, Respectively.

All three alleles of the uki mutation contain premature stop codons positioned in exon 5 and exon 7.(B) Representation of the protein structure of Ptc2 shows that the identified nonsense mutation is positioned after the sixth transmembrane domain, probably resulting in a malfunctioning protein.(C) ISH experiments show that Ptc1 expression is increased in uki and lep (arrow), confirming the aberrant activation of the Hh signaling pathway.</div></div>
