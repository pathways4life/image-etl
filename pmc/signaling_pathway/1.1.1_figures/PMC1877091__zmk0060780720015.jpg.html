From: PDCD10 Interacts with Ste20-related Kinase MST4 to Promote Cell Growth and Transformation via Modulation of the ERK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PDCD10/MST4 signaling pathway and CCM protein function. The CCM1/2 complex may modulate integrin-mediated cell adhesion via association with ICAP1 in the cytoplasm, as well as organize a p38 MAPK signaling complex (Zawistowski et al., 2005). However, it has been reported that MST4 activated MEK-1/ERK via a Ras/Raf independent pathway (Lin et al., 2001). These data, and ours, confirmed that PDCD10 (CCM3) interacted with MST4 and modulated the ERK MAPK cascade, but not P38 and JNK, resulting in growth induction and cellular transformation.</div></div>
