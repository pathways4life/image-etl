Aberrant activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR-p70S6K pathway in pituitaries of TRβPV/PV mice increases protein synthesis and cell growth. AKT decreases cyclin D1 degradation by inhibiting GSK-3β activity through phosphorylation (17). AKT also inhibits cell apoptosis through phosphorylation of BAD and FoxO3a. Phosphorylated BAD is incapable of inhibiting the activity of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (33,34). Similar to the phosphorylated BAD, phosphorylated FoxO3a is retained in cytoplasm and thus is incapable of activating the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim (35). All these processes are reversed by LY294002 in vivo by deactivating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. By decreasing the subsequent phosphorylation events after the AKT activation, LY ultimately reduces tumor growth by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis in TSHomas of TRβPV/PV mice.</div></div>
