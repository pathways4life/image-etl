The ID complex is deubiquitylated by USP1 whose activity is enhanced by interaction with UAF1. USP1 has a parallel role in the deubiquitylation of PCNA. USP1/UAF1 substrate affinity is regulated by auxiliary factors such as ELG1, which is required for the deubiquitylation of PCNA specifically. The DUBs are themselves subject to regulation on both a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Importantly, USP1 is polyubiquitylated as DNA replication concludes. Polyubiquitylated USP1 is targeted for proteasomal degradation.</div></div>
