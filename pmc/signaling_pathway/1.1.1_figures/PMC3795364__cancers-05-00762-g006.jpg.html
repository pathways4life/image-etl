From: Influence of Levamisole and Other Angiogenesis Inhibitors on Angiogenesis and Endothelial Cell Morphology in Vitro. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic presentation of the influence of angiogenesis inhibitors on EC signaling. Important signaling pathways in ECs are the VEGF pathway, the ECM integrin pathway and the mTOR pathway. Blocking of the VEGF pathway by VEGF antibodies, SU5614, levamisole or PTPI IV inhibits differentiation. Blocking of ECM integrin signaling by TSP or mTOR signaling by rapamycin inhibits proliferation as does salubrinal and TNP-470. PF4, suramin, NSAIDs, clodronate, NSC87877, PTPI I, PTPI II inhibit EC proliferation in a morphologically similar way, while ibandronate gives mixed morphology, but the exact relationships between these with the major signaling pathways are unknown.</div></div>
