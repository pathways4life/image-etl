From: Effects of Toll-Like Receptors 3 and 4 in the Osteogenesis of Stem Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Expression of β-catenin. Western blotting analysis was used to access the expression of total β-catenin and nuclear β-catenin in OBs stimulated by TLR-3 ligands (n = 12) and TLR-4 ligands (n = 12). Untreated OBs were used as negative control (n = 12). More expression of β-catenin indicated better activation of Wnt signaling pathway. TLR-4 ligands inhibited Wnt signaling pathway, while TLR-3 ligands did not affect that mechanism.</div></div>
