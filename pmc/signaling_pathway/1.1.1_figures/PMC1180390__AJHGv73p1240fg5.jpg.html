Growth-factor binding to RTKs on the cell surface activates the Ras/MAPK-signaling pathway, which mediates signals to transcription factors in the nucleus. Changes in gene expression lead to cellular responses, such as differentiation and proliferation. p120-RasGAP (RasGAP) downregulates Ras signaling by catalyzing intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras. p120-RasGAP also is implicated in signaling to the cytoskeleton by binding Rap1a and/or p190-RhoGAP (RhoGAP).</div></div>
