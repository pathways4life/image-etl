Extensive base-pairing between the siRNA and target gene B results in silencing. (b) A false-positive result incorrectly infers non-pathway gene C as a pathway member by neglecting off-targeting effects, depicted by dashed gray arrows from the siRNA (red) to pathway genes B and F. (c) Haystack explains screen results as a linear combination of the predicted off-targeting effects, depicted by dashed gray arrows from the siRNA (red) to pathway genes B and F. Imperfect base-pairing between siRNA (red) and 3â€²UTR region of off-target genes results in down-regulation.</div></div>
