From: Functional roles of gangliosides in neurodevelopment--An overview of recent advances. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A wide variety of glycoconjugates such as heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), chondrotin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), N-glycosylated cystatin C, and galectins-1 are involved in signaling pathways inducing proliferation and self-renewal of NSCs. The Ras-MAPK pathway mediating the proliferation signal is modulated in the lipid rafts, cell-surface microdomains rich in GSLs (e.g., GD3). Modification of GSL expression represses the Ras-MAPK pathway but not the JAK-STAT pathway (inducing astrocyte differentiation) and the PI3K-Akt pathway (inducing survival), suggesting a specific role of GSLs in the Ras-MAPK pathway. The glycoconjugate antigens and related molecules are indicated in red. (Reproduced from [54])</div></div>
