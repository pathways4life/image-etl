From: Anti-CD63 antibodies suppress IgE-dependent allergic reactions in vitro and in vivo. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic representation of our model for the mechanism of anti-CD63 inhibition. The Lyn–Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway for degranulation is shown in gray. The Ca2+-independent PI3K–Gab2–PKCδ signaling pathway shared with the integrin–tetraspanin complex is shown in black and yellow. Mechanism 1 (steric hindrance of integrin binding to their ECM substrates) is represented in green. Mechanism 2 (general disruption of the membrane complexes containing CD63) is represented in blue. Mechanism 3 (sequestration of PI4K) is represented in red.</div></div>
