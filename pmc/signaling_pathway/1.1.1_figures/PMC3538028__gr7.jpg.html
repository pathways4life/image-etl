Fibrotic injury induced TGF-β1 production of tubular epithelial cells. TGF-β1 then induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and profibrotic phenotype through up-regulation of p21 and activation of the JNK pathway, respectively. TGF-β1 and PDGF subsequently stimulated pericyte-myofibroblast transition through differentiation and proliferation, respectively.</div></div>
