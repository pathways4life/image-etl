From: Genetic Alterations in the Phosphatidylinositol-3 Kinase/Akt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in Thyroid Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Diagrammatic illustration of a self-enhancement mechanism of the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway through PTEN methylation in thyroid cancer. In this model, activating genetic alterations, including gene copy gain or mutations in the PI3K/Akt pathway activate the pathway. This in turn leads to PTEN methylation, resulting in silencing of the PTEN gene. Loss of PTEN removes the inhibitory pressure of the pathway, forming a malicious self-activation cycle for the PI3K/Akt pathway signaling. This is seen most commonly in aggressive thyroid cancers, such as anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), as discussed in the text.</div></div>
