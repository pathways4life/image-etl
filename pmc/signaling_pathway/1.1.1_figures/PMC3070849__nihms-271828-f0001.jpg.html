From: Emergence of the PI3-kinase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> as a central modulator of normal and aberrant B cell differentiation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Pro-B cell development is supported by IL-7 stimulation via the PI3K and STAT5 pathways. Weak PI3K signaling promotes retention of Foxo1 in the nucleus to drive Il7ra expression. PI3K signaling via the pre-BCR can be augmented by CD19 and countered by BLNK(SLP-65). Expression of pre-BCR components is repressed in an IRF4/IRF8-dependent manner to permit Foxo1-dependent expression of Rag in resting pre-B cells. Peripheral B cells require PI3K signaling to promote survival while Foxo1 activity is crucial for expression of Sell and Aicda, suggesting a dynamic balance for Foxo1 activity in peripheral B cell homeostasis and differentiation.</div></div>
