Components that are shared between the FG and HOG pathways are depicted in solid green. Components of the FG pathway are outlined in yellow, and components of the HOG pathway are outlined in blue. For simplicity, some interactions for which there exist evidence are not depicted such as those between Sho1 and Ste50 and Sho1 and Ste11. Also, the interaction between Ste50 and Cdc42 is not depicted in the HOG pathway, and only one of several possible transcription factors is depicted in the HOG pathway.</div></div>
