Common genes in cell death and stress response networks are affected by metyrapone or carbenoxolone..  From: <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Analysis Reveals Common Pro-Survival Mechanisms of Metyrapone and Carbenoxolone after Traumatic Brain Injury. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(<b>A</b>) Apoptosis signaling at 24 h post-TBI. (<b>B</b>) Death receptor signaling at 4 h post-TBI. (<b>C</b>) Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) signaling at 4 h post-TBI. (<b>D</b>) Amyloid processing pathway at 4 h post-TBI. Gene expression in all groups for pathways Aâ€“C is shown up or down-regulated relative to sham control levels with no fold cut-offs. Metyrapone and carbenoxolone attenuate expression of both pro-death and pro-survival genes in these pathways such as FLIP, which is known to protect against ischemic cell death.
