Hedgehog <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and the cilium.  From: The Primary Cilium as a Complex <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Center. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway in vertebrates utilizes the cilium as a signaling compartment. In the absence of the Hh ligand (A), the receptor Ptch resides in the cilium and through an unknown mechanism inhibits the transmembrane protein Smo. In the absence of ligand, the repressor forms of the Gli transcription factors inhibit Hh responsive gene transcription, while Gli activator is maintained in the cilia via Sufu binding.(B) Upon Hh binding, Ptch translocates out of the cilia membrane and its inhibition of Smo is alleviated. Activated Smo translocates into the cilia membrane and through unknown mechanisms the Gli activators translocate to the nucleus and activate Hh responsive gene expression.</div></div>
