IGF-1 signaling through the IRS proteins, which bind to the p110 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K), leads to the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) and phosphorylation of AKT by phosphoinositide dependent kinase (PDK1). Phosphorylation of AKT leads to subsequent activation of mTOR and phosphorylates or inactivates a family of apoptosis-inducing forkhead transcription factors, including forkhead box O1 (FOXO1 or FKHR), forkhead box O3 (FOXO3, or FKHRL1), and forkhead box O4 (MLLT-7, FOXO4 or AFX). Life-long enhanced IGF-1 signaling pathway is associated with shortening of lifespan. In contrast, inhibition of mTOR by dietary restriction or rapamycin has been shown to be associated with longevity in mammals. It has recently been shown that increased levels of factors such as leptin and IGFBP3 that can inhibit the IGF-1 signaling pathway, are also associated with preservation of naïve CD8 T cells in human nonagenarians.</div></div>
