As a central energy sensor, the mTORC1 signaling pathway is regulated by various upstream signals such as nutrients, growth factor signaling, and caloric restriction (CR), leading to altered Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial function and autophagic activity, which play critical roles in aging</div></div>
