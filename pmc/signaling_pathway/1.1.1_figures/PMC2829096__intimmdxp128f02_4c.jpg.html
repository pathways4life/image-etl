From: Extracellular and intracellular pathogen recognition by Drosophila PGRP-LE and PGRP-LC. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Recognition of microorganisms and induction of innate immune responses in Drosophila. (A) The primary humoral response, i.e. activation of the proPO cascade leading to melanization, is induced by the cleavage of proPO to PO by a serine protease, proPO-activating enzyme (PPAE). (B) A constitutive hemolymph protein, PGRP-LE, binds to monomeric and polymeric DAP-type peptidoglycans (PGNs), which are components of many Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria, and activates the proPO cascade upstream of PPAE. PGRP-LE is also involved in activating the secondary humoral response, the imd pathway-dependent induction of antibacterial peptides. (C) Membrane PGRP-LC is also required for monomeric and polymeric DAP-type peptidoglycan-mediated activation of the imd pathway. (D) PGRP-SA in the hemolymph is involved in the recognition of Gram-positive bacteria with Lys-type peptidoglycans and is required for activation of the Toll pathway in cooperation with GNBP1. PGRP-SD has some redundant functions with PGRP-SA and GNBP1. (E) GNBP3 is involved in yeast-mediated activation of the Toll pathway. (F) The activation of the Toll pathway is mediated by its active ligand, Spz, cleaved from pro-Spz by the serine protease cascade, including the SPE, Spheroide, Spirit, Sphinx, Persephone, ModSP and Grass. (G) In addition to the extracellular functions, PGRP-LE induces anti-microbial peptides through the imd pathway and autophagy in the cytoplasm. Signaling via the Toll or imd pathway activates NF-ÎºB and subsequent transcription of genes for anti-microbial peptides such as Drosomycin and Diptericin.</div></div>
