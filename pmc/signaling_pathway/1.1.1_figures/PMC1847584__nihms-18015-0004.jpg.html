Note that hyperpolarized bud growth is due to Cln2 overexpression, not mating signaling. Also see Figure S2B.The 16E mutations disrupt Ste5 membrane localization mediated by the PM domain (Q59L), but not that mediated by a foreign transmembrane domain (CTM). Top, membrane localization induces mating pathway signaling, causing pear-shaped “shmoo” morphology. Bottom, localization results were similar in a non-signaling strain (ste4Δ ste7Δ).Negative charge disrupts membrane localization of Ste5 N-terminal fragments. Localization was compared (in ste4Δ ste7Δ cells) for WT and mutant derivatives of GFP-Ste5(1-214) and GST-GFP-Ste5(1-125), which can localize to the membrane in the absence of pheromone, Gβγ, and other Ste5 sequences (Winters et al., 2005).</div></div>
