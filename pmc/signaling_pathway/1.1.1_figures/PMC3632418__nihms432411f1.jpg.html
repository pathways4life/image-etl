Regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>.  From: mTOR as a potential treatment target for epilepsy. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The mTOR is a serine–threonine protein kinase, which forms two complexes, rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 and relatively rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2 (not shown). mTORC1 stimulates downstream signaling mechanisms involved in ribosomal biogenesis (S6K and ribosomal S6) and protein translation (4E-BP1 and eIF4E). Primarily through regulation of protein synthesis, the mTOR pathway modulates a variety of important physiological functions, such as cell growth and proliferation, metabolism and brain-specific processes. By similar mechanisms, the mTOR pathway may influence epileptogenesis under pathological conditions (e.g., synaptic reorganization, ion channel expression and neuronal death). In turn, the mTOR pathway may be activated or inhibited by various physiological or pathological stimuli via various upstream signaling pathways and intermediary proteins (TSC1, TSC2 and Rheb). Genetic mutations in different elements of these upstream pathways (TSC1, TSC2, PTEN and STRADα) have been identified that cause hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway and may lead to various disease phenotypes, including epilepsy.
