The 1,368 DEGs in HT29 and 1,002 DEGs in GC3/c1 were mapped to the IPA- defined network. The significance p-values that determine the probability that the association between the genes in the dataset and the canonical pathway is by chance alone were calculated by Fisher's exact test, and are expressed as â€“log (p-value). <b>A</b>. Pathways with enriched down-regulated genes. <b>B</b>. Pathways with enriched up-regulated genes. Blue: Pathways common to both HT29 and GC3/c1. Red: Pathways unique to either HT29 or GC3/c1. Yellow squares: Ratio of the number of DEGs that map to a specific canonical pathway divided by total number of genes that make up that pathway.</div></div>
