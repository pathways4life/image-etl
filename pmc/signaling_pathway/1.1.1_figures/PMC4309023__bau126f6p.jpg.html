Schematic shows the cross connection of the core Hedgehog pathway (taken from KEGG) with the other pathways and molecules [e.g. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) signaling pathway, proteasome pathway, Vitamin D3, Megalin and TGFβ2 molecules], which are considered in different databases, such as NCI-PID, CPDB, GENE GO and MILLIPORE. Hence, the number of pathway components of this pathway varies significantly within these databases.</div></div>
