Note, the AopP induced rough eye phenotype is not rescued by the activation of the ERK signaling pathway, whereas the VopA induced rough eye is completely rescued by the activation of the ERK pathway at the level of Rolled.<b>(B)</b> Phenotypes of adult Drosophila eyes resulting from constitutive expression of the JNK pathway activator Eiger (Drosophila homolouge of mammalian TNF), and from a co-expression of Eiger with the indicated bacterial protein. Note that AopP only results in a slight increase in eye size whereas AvrA, a potent inhibitor of JNK activity, completely rescues the Eiger-induced small eye phenotype. Also, note appearance of black necrotic-like tissue the eye where Eiger and AopP are co-expressed.</div></div>
