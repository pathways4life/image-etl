(<b>a</b>) RT can induce CaP-RR cells with EMT and enhanced CSC phenotypes, and activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, resulting in CaP metastasis and recurrence after RT. (<b>b</b>) A dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 combined with RT can inactivate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, reducing EMT and CSC phenotypes and leading to increased radiosensitivity. All data used in RR cell lines were based on cells between 5 and 6 weeks post radiation treatment</div></div>
