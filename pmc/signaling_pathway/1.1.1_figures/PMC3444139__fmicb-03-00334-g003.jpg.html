Compared to normal T cell, HTLV-1-infected cell shows intense activity of NF-κB pathway through the Tax interactome. In contrast, leukemic cell sustains strong NF-κB activity without Tax by acquisition of miR-31-dependent NIK expression. Activation of the non-canonical pathway ultimately joins canonical pathway, resulting in transactivation of numerous target genes important for cell survival, cytokine production, and invasiveness.</div></div>
