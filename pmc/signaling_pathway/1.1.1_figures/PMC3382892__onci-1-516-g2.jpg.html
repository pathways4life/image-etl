Human Th17 cells are resistant to apoptosis and long-lived memory T cells. Th17 cells express high levels of HIF-1Î±, Notch signaling molecules and Bcl2, and multiple stem cell core genes. HIF/Notch/Bcl2 signaling pathway controls Th17 cell survival, and promote Th17 cell-mediated T cell immunity. Th17 cells are polyfunctional and highly plastic in the chronic inflammatory environment, and would be converted into regulatory T cell-type and Th-1 type effector cells. It remains unknown if HIF/Notch/Bcl2 signaling pathway regulates Th17 cell plasticity.</div></div>
