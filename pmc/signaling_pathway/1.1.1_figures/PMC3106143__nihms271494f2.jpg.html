The contribution of multiple pathways to a composite endpoint can result in oscillations.

An example of a common endpoint could be the phosphorylation level of a MAPK. Here Pathway A ends in endpoint activation early, or in response to low concentrations of a triggering estrogenic ligand. Pathway B has the same activation endpoint, but that signaling cascade arrives at the endpoint later, or in response to higher concentrations of the estrogenic ligand. However, since both pathways are activated by the same ligand-receptor interaction, the endpoint integrates these actions, the composite of which oscillates.</div></div>
