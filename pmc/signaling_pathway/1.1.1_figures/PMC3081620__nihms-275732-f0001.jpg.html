From: Activation of The Transforming Growth Factor-Beta <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in Bacterial Otitis Media. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A representative cascade of the TGF-β pathway. TGF-β1~3, TGF-β receptors (I &amp; II), Smads, and transcriptional factor (TF) constitute the cascade. TGF-β ligands (including TGF-β1~3, activins, BMPs, etc.) with the assistance of accessory receptor (betaglycan) activate the formation of heterotetrameric complexes of type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors which in turn activate the intracellular effectors of TGF-β signaling, Smad2/3 by phosphorylation. The action recruits Smad4 to the complex and translocate into the cellular nucleus where Smad/2/3/4, working together with a cellular context-specific transcriptional factor (TF), bind to DNA and trigger the expression of a battery of genes including collagens, fibronectins, laminins, etc. Eventually, the TGF-β signaling pathway leads to fibrotic responses.</div></div>
