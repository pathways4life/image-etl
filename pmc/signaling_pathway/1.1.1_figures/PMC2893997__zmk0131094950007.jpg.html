Increased ARF6-GTP levels lead to enhanced PLD activation, and potentially, the recruitment of nm23H1, to facilitate growth factor internalization into signaling endosomes. Signaling endosomes serve as platforms for constitutive receptor signaling. PA enrichment on these vesicular compartments could be important for recruitment of downstream signaling molecules. The type of signaling response elicited is probably dependent on the cell type. In MDCK cysts, elevated ARF6-GTP leads to activation of the ERK signaling pathway.</div></div>
