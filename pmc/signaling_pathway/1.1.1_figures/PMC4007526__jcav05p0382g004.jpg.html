The effect of carnosine on protein markers of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was assessed by western blot after SGC-7901 (A) and MKN45 (B) cells were treatment with carnosine and rapamycin for 48 h. β-Actin was used as the loading control. The data are means ± SD of three independent experiments. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01.</div></div>
