Biased signaling describes a situation in which a receptor preferentially activates one signaling pathway over another. (Left) Ligand bias is used to differentiate between two ligands acting on the same receptor, where ligand A favorably activates pathway 1, whereas ligand B activates pathway 2. (Center) In receptor bias, the same ligand binds to two different receptors, and activates pathway 1 via receptor A, but pathway 2 through receptor B. (Right) In tissue (or cell) bias, the same ligand: receptor-complex is activated in two different tissues or cell types (or different species), and in tissue A pathway 1 is preferentially activated, whereas pathway 2 is more likely to be activated in tissue B.</div></div>
