From: BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, Encoding a Helix-Loop-Helix Protein, Is a Novel Gene Involved in Brassinosteroid <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> and Controls Bending of the Lamina Joint in Rice. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">BR signaling model in rice. Induction of BU1 by BL is partially inhibited in OsBRI1 mutant (d61-2) and RGA1 mutant (d1). In addition, BU1 is the primary response (up-regulated) gene to BR signaling. Therefore, BU1 may be a novel mediator of a distinct pathway from OsBZR1, because OsBZR1 functions as the transcription repressor. Moreover, regulation of downstream genes by BU1 may be through a complex mechanism like the regulation of human Id protein.</div></div>
