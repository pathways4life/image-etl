This figure was derived from IPA. The colored molecules were genes whose expression altered significantly in Calu-6 compared to U1752. The red color represented up-regulated genes in Calu-6, while the green color represented down-regulated genes in Calu-6. A: Regulation of the EMT Pathway in Calu-6 compared to U1752. TGF-Î²-EMT was shown, while Wnt-EMT, Notch-EMT and Receptor tyrosine kinase-EMT were not shown. B: Tec kinase signaling in Calu-6 compared to U1752.</div></div>
