From: TLR-induced activation of Btk - Role for endosomal MHC class II molecules revealed. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic of crosstalk between TLR pathway and MHC molecules. <b>(A)</b> The traditional view of TLR signaling which holds that TLR ligation initiates several signaling cascades within the cell that drive the production of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines that are essential for both innate and adaptive immune responses resulting in pathogen clearance. <b>(B)</b> Recent evidence has shown that a second pathway involving crosstalk between the TLR pathway and MHC pathway is initiated. This crosstalk results in the formation the Btk-CD40-MHC class II signaling complex at the endosome that enhances TLR-driven cytokine production. Ligation of TLRs also results in the inhibition of MARCH-1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of MHC class II molecules, potentially increasing the pool of intracellular MHC class II molecules available to form the MHC-Btk signalosome at the endosome.</div></div>
