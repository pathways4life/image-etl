From: The Role and Regulation of mTOR in T Lymphocyte Function. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">mTOR signaling and its regulation by DGKs. mTOR signaling is mediated by two signaling complexes, raptor-containing mTORC1 and rictor containing mTORC2. DAG, generated by PLCÎ³1 following TCR engagement, activates the RasGRP1-Ras-Erk1/2 pathway. The pathway plays important roles for mTORC1 and mTORC2 activation in T cells. DGKs negatively control both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling by terminating DAG in T cells.</div></div>
