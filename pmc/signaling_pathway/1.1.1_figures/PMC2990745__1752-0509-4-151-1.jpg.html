(a) JAK-STAT signaling pathway; (b) Ribosome complex; (c) MAPK signaling pathway. The yellow and red colors represent proteins (both hubs and their neighbors) identified from the Wang and Desmedt datasets, respectively. The orange colors represent the overlapped neighbors of these two hub proteins. Please see the main text for detailed explanation.</div></div>
