MyD88-dependent pathway are indicated to the left and TICAM-1 pathway are shown to the right in blue. Many signaling molecules are involved in the two pathways leading to different outputs. NK and CTL are generated by the resultant mDC activation. In particular, cross-priming must occur in mDC to induce CTL, the molecular mechanism of which are largely unknown.</div></div>
