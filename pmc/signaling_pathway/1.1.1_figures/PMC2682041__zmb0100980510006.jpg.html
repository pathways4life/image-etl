(A) A simplified model of signaling through the TOR pathway (focused on the regulation of NCR genes) based on previous models (15, 29, 33). (B) Rapamycin and caffeine sensitivity of diverse mutants in genes relevant in the TOR pathway in the presence (+) or the absence of PTC1 (âˆ’). Cultures were spotted on YPD plates containing the indicated concentrations of the drugs, and growth was monitored after 2 days. WT, wild type.</div></div>
