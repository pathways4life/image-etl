NOD2-mediated <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways.  From: NOD2, an Intracellular Innate Immune Sensor Involved in Host Defense and Crohn's Disease. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">This figure provides an overview of the major signaling pathways of NOD2. The central and perhaps dominant pathway is the RICK-dependent pathway that involves activation of RICK followed by downstream activation of TAK1; this then leads to activation of MAP kinases and NF-kB. As indicated in the text, interaction of NOD2 with CARD 9 or Bid may determine which downstream components are activated. On the right side of the figure a RICK-independent NOD2 signaling pathway initiated by viral ssRNA is depicted; this involves binding of ssRNA to NOD2 followed by interaction with MAVS, an adaptor protein associated with mitochondria. This leads to activation of IRF3 and induction of type I interferon. On the left side of the figure interaction of NOD2 with the autophagy proteins in depicted. Such interaction can take the form of RICK-independent interaction with ATG16L1 and trafficking of the latter to the cell membrane, or RICK-dependent (and therefore NF-kB-dependent activation of autophagy proteins. Through this pathway NOD2 can affect bacterial handling and elimination or antigen presentation.</div></div>
