In patient #2 (Wilmâ€™s tumor), the mTOR pathway is also activated with most tumor cells moderately expressing p-mTOR (Ser 2448) in plasmalemmal and cytoplasmic compartments. This coincides with the constitutive activation of one of the downstream effectors of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, namely p-p70S6K (Thr 389). There is constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway p-ERK 1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) expression in the Wilms tumor.</div></div>
