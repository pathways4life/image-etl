There are 40 putative insulin-like peptides in C. elegans, and their secretion is mediated by UNC-31/CAPS and the conserved ATPase ASNA-1. DAF-2/InsR is the sole insulin/IGF receptor in C. elegans, and it signals through a conserved PI3K pathway to antagonize function of DAF-16/FOXO. DAF-16/FOXO activates transcription of genes that promote L1 arrest, dauer formation, stress resistance, and lifespan extension. DAF-16/FOXO is not the only effector of insulin-like signaling (Tullet et al. 2008). DAF-16/FOXO is also regulated by additional factors and signaling pathways (Landis and Murphy 2010). DAF-18/PTEN functions independently of DAF-16/FOXO in the germline (Fukuyama et al. 2006).</div></div>
