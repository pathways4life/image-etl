From: The anti-motility <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> mechanism of TGF?3 that controls cell traffic during skin wound healing. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">While TGFβ3 blocks proliferation of both HDFs and HKCs, it selectively inhibits migration of HDFs, but not HKCs, due to 7 to 10 fold higher expression of TβRII (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2006). TGFβ3 uses TβRII/TβRI/Smads2/3/Smad4/PKA pathway to transmit its anti-motility signal. The anti-proliferation signaling by TGFβ is beyond the scope of this study. The numbers in “n  = ” are arbitrary to reflect the differences in TβR expression in fold between HDFs and HKCs.</div></div>
