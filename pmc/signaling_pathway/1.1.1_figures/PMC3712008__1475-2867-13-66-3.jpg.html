Inhibition of the JUN/MAPK pathway shortens the early G1 subphase rendering the cell independent of differentiation and apoptotic factors. In the same time, activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway induces the cell to progress to late G1 subphase beyond the restriction (R) point; the cell may then undergo symmetric (proliferation) or asymmetric (self-renewal) division. In green: proteins with repressive effect, in red: proteins with activating effect.</div></div>
