Cross-talk between signals from self-pMHC and IL-7.  From: IL-7 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and CD127 receptor regulation in the control of T cell homeostasis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Many transcription factors and molecules downstream of TCR control CD127 expression, either by inducing or inhibiting its transcription. In green; transcription factors inducing CD127 transcription. In red; transcription factors repressing CD127 transcription. TCR signals can also induce formation of lipid rafts, which could recruit and concentrate IL-7R, thereby amplifying its downstream signaling pathway. It is still unclear if IL-7 signaling activates the PI3K signaling pathway in lymphoreplete hosts, but if it were to be true, Foxo1 and Foxp1 could finely regulate CD127 expression downstream of IL-7, allowing a limited IL-7 to support survival of a maximal number of T cells. Whether Gfi-1, GABPÎ± or Ets-1 are are activated downstream of IL-7R or self-pMHC/TCR interactions is still not known, but Gfi-1 expression is induced downstream of strong TCR triggering [79, 80, 106].</div></div>
