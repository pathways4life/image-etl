The relative expression levels of Notch signaling components in RPE cells were determined by real-time RT-PCR analysis. The detected components included five Notch ligands (JAG1, JAG2, DLL1, DLL3, and DLL4) and three MAML transcriptional coactivators (MAML1, MAML2, and MAML3). Error bars represent at least two independent experiments.</div></div>
