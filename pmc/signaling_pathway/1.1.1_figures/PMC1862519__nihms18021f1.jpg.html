From: TRPC Channels as Novel Effectors of BDNF <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>: Potential Implications for Rett Syndrome. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Intracellular signaling cascades activated by BDNF-stimulated autophosphorylation of TrkB receptors may affect prominent pathways responsible for elevations of intracellular Ca2+ levels in neurons. Activation of the PLC-Î³/IP3 signaling pathway leads to Ca2+ mobilization from IP3-sensitive intracellular stores. In addition, NMDA receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels could be directly phosphorylated by activated TrkB receptors or indirectly through the Ras-MAPK/ERK or PI3-K pathways. Combined, these covalent modifications potentially enhance Ca2+ signals within spines and dendrites.</div></div>
