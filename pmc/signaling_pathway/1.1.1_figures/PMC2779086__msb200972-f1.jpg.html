Genes harboring cell signaling-associated domains were randomly selected and then used to generate libraries of corresponding Flag-tagged cDNAs and siRNAs. These were then used in three high-throughput screens to map proteinâ€“protein interactions by LUMIER and to examine the effect of altering protein expression levels on a transcriptional reporter. The data from the three screens were integrated to derive a combined pathway score (CPS), which predicts the likelihood that a protein is a component of the signaling pathway being studied.</div></div>
