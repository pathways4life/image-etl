Following upstimulation of GPCRs, IP3 is liberated following the activation of PLC astrocytes. Astrocytes then release Ca2+ from internal stores through the opening of IP3R ion channels. <b>(B)</b> The astrocytic process together with pre- and post-synaptic regions of neurons constitutes a synapse – that is, a tripartite synapse. The local microdomains of astrocytic processes can be excited by neuronal activity through glutamate or other neurotransmitters released from the synaptic cleft by activating GPCRs. Ca2+ release from internal stores can mediate glutamate or other chemical transmitter release, a process called ‘gliotransmission’, which signals back to the neuron by activating neuronal receptors through the tripartite synapse.DAG: Diacyl glycerol; ER: Endoplasmic reticulum; GPCR: G-protein coupled receptor; IP3: Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP3R: Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor; PIP2: Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PLC: Phospholipase C.</div></div>
