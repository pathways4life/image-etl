In the assay system, the Cu2+ ion concentration was 100 mM, and the diacetyl concentration was 10−2. (B) Dose-response curves of wild-type N2 and mutants to diacetyl with (+) or without (-) 100 mM of Cu2+ ion. Differences between groups were determined using two-way ANOVA. (C) Dose-response curves of wild-type N2 and mutants to Cu2+ ion with (+) or without (-) 10−2 of diacetyl. Differences between groups were determined using two-way ANOVA. (D) Locomotion behavior of wild-type N2 and mutants in the absence (-) of food under the well-fed or starved condition. Locomotion behavior was assessed by the body bend. Bars represent mean ± S.E.M. **P&lt;0.01 vs N2 (if not specially indicated).</div></div>
