In these tumors, such as ABC-DLBCL, NF-κB inhibitors are beneficial as they counteract the oncogenic function of NF-κB and would promote tumor cell death.(<b>B</b>) In tumors where the pro-survival signal derives from NF-κB-independent BCL2 overexpression, a functional NF-κB pathway is required to mediate the therapy-induced senescence response by activating the transcription of genes of SASP. In this scenario, such as in GCB DLBCL, NF-κB inhibitors are detrimental as they interfere with the senescence response that would normally promote tumor cell death.</div></div>
