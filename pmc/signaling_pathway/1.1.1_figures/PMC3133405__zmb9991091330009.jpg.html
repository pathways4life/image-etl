Three separate side branches of the Toll signaling pathway are activated either by microbial cell wall PRRs (GNBP3, for fungi and yeasts; GNBP1, PGRP-SA, and PGRP-SD for Gram-positive bacteria) or danger-signaling (virulence factors). These three side branches of the pathway converge on SPE, which activates Spz (the ligand of Toll). The intracellular Toll pathway signals trough Dif to activate the expression of Drs and other antimicrobial peptides in the fat body. The GNBP3 and danger-signaling branches of the Toll signaling pathway are regulated independently by Spn1 and nec. Both of these serpins represent nonredundant genetic functions, and the lack activates Drs expression.</div></div>
