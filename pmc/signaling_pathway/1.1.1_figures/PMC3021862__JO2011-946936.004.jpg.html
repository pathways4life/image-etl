From: Survivin Selectively Modulates Genes Deregulated in Human Leukemia Stem Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Genes regulated by Survivin in ITD-Flt3+KSL cells and deregulated in LSC are mapped on functional signaling network associated with epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway. Epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway (EGFR) is significantly enriched in the shared genes associated with LSC and Survivin signaling by pathway enrichment analysis in KEGG and Gene Ontology database. Our analysis shows that 13 molecules shared by LSC and Survivin signaling are mapped on a functional signaling network associated with EGFR. The network was created based on KEGG database using Cytoscape software. Green circle and red circle represents downregulation and upregulation by Survivin gene deletion, respectively.</div></div>
