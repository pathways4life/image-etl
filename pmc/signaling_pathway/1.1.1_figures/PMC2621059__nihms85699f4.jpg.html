Network extension of the innate immune Toll-like receptor (TLR) <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> and its participation in necroptosis.  From: Identification of a molecular <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> network that regulates a cellular necrotic cell death <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> by a genome wide siRNA screen. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(<b>A</b>) Network was constructed by anchoring on TLR pathway components (CD40, RIPK1, JUN and SPP1) that are also zVAD.fmk hits, using protein-protein interaction data curated from literature and high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid screens. (<b>B</b>) Autocrine production of TNFα is involved in zVAD-induced necroptosis. L929 cells were pretreated with indicated concentrations of anti-mouse TNFα antibody (μg/ml) for 1hr followed by treatment with or without 20μM zVAD.fmk or 30μM Nec-1 for 16hr. (<b>C</b>) Involvement of TLR pathway in necroptosis. L929 cells were treated with indicated chemicals for 19hr. Cellular viability was measured as described in Figure 1A. polyI:C; 25μg/ml, interferon gamma (IFNγ); 1000U/ml, Nec-1; 30μM.</div></div>
