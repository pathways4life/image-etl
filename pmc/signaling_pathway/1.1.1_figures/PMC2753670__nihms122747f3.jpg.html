From: Cross-regulation of <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> by ITAM-associated receptors. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Integration of ITAM and cytokine Jak–STAT signaling. Low-avidity ligation of ITAM-associated receptors leads to tonic calcium signaling that maintains basal activity of a CaMK–Pyk2 pathway that amplifies Jak activity and enhances downstream activation of STAT1. Cytokine receptors and Jaks also activate Pyk2, and Pyk2 can thus relay signals between ITAM-associated receptors and cytokine receptors bidirectionally. ITAM-containing DAP12 also modulates cell responses to IL-4. Cytokines such as IFN-γ, IFN-α, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-27 regulate expression of ITAM-associated receptors and STAT1, and thus cytokine and ITAM-associated receptor signaling pathways are tightly integrated.
