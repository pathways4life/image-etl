Aag2 cells were co-transfected with reporter plasmids and in vitro transcribed CHIKVRep-SG-eGFP RNA, followed by stimulation of immune pathways by heat inactivated bacteria. Signaling activity was measured by activity of FFluc. Internal transfection control (RLuc) is shown to indicate the levels of gene expression. PBS, PBS added to cells containing only the pathway reporter and internal transfection control; E. coli, heat inactivated bacteria added to cells containing only the pathway reporter and internal transfection control; B. subtilis, heat inactivated bacteria added to cells containing only the pathway reporter and internal transfection control; CHIKV, PBS added to cells containing pathway reporter, internal transfection control and CHIKVRep-SG-eGFP replicon RNA; CHIKV+E. coli, heat inactivated E. coli added to cells containing pathway reporter, internal transfection control and CHIKVRep-SG-eGFP replicon; CHIKV+B. subtilis, heat inactivated B. subtilis added to cells containing pathway reporter, internal transfection control and CHIKVRep-SG-eGFP replicon. Data is shown after subtraction of background luciferase levels and relative to PBS control. (<b>A</b>) JAK/STAT pathway stimulation with heat inactivated E. coli in the presence or absence of CHIKV replicon. (<b>B</b>) IMD pathway stimulation with heat inactivated E. coli in the presence or absence of CHIKV replicon. (<b>C</b>) Toll pathway stimulation with heat inactivated B. subtilis in the presence or absence of CHIKV replicon. (<b>D</b>) Co-transfection of pACT-Renilla with either CHIKVRep-SG-eGFP replicon RNA or control FFLuc expressing RNA. (<b>E</b>) Co-transfection of control RNA in the presence and absence of CHIKVRep-SG-eGFP replicon RNA. Graphs represent the mean of three independent experiments performed in triplicate and error bars represent the standard error of mean. *, significantly different using a general linear mixed model.</div></div>
