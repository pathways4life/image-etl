(a) Expression levels of IRS1, IRS2, AKT1, and FOXO1 mRNAs in livers (left) and pancreas (right) of control and Cmah-null mice were determined using real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (*P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01; ***P &lt; 0.001). (b) Western blot analysis of proteins involved in the target pathway in liver (left) and pancreas (right) of control and Cmah-null mice. Actin was used as a loading control. Band intensities were quantified by image processing and analysis was made using ImageJ v1.32.</div></div>
