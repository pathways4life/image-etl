TLR1 and TLR6 recognize their ligands as heterodimers with TLR2. For TLR4, MD2, and CD14 are required for LPS recognition and signaling. TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, and TLR9 are currently thought to deliver their signal by forming homodimers after interacting with their ligands. TLR3, TLR7/8, and TLR9 are intracellular TLRs and are involved in the recognition of nucleic acids. Most TLRs, except for TLR3, signal through MyD88 pathway to activate NF-κB and AP1. TLR3 and TLR4 can signal through MyD88-independent pathway (TRIF pathway) to activate INF-β.</div></div>
