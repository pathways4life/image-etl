In contrast, dihydrosphingosine-1 phosphate (dhS1P) suppresses TGF-β signaling through the TGF-β receptor-independent, PTEN-dependent mechanism [41]. DhS1P treatment triggers rapid phosphorylation of PTEN and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, in which PTEN facilitates Smad2/3 dephosphorylation by stabilizing Smad1/2 phosphatase, PPM1A. Interestingly, both sphingolipid mediators utilize the same receptor, S1P1, suggesting that additional, presently unknown components of these pathways contribute to the distinct postreceptor signaling.</div></div>
