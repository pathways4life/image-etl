Three out of the four major branches of the MAPK signaling pathway are shown: ERK1/2 (MAP2K1/2), c-Jun, and p38 (modified from KEGG pathway map 04010;  http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). Mutations affecting the ERK1/2 (MAP2K1/2) branch are identified in approximately 70% of patients with Noonan syndrome (genes marked with orange stars). Note that genes with significant ChIP-on-CHIP bindings sites (Supplemental Table 23) are marked in yellow; additional significantly differentially expressed genes in the human cell lines are marked with red boxes.    </div></div>
