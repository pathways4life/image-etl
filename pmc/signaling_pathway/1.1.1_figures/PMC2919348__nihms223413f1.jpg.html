Pointed arrows indicate a positive regulatory connection, blocks indicate an inhibitory regulatory connection. Genes depicted in red can function as tumor suppressors (loss of function mutations can cause overgrowth), genes depicted in green can function as oncogenes (over expression and/or activation can cause overgrowth), genes depicted in black have not been shown to function as tmor suppressors or oncogenes. At the botom, genes depicted in gray encode DNA binding proteins that can partner with Yki/Yap to influence transcription of downstream target genes. Hippo signaling influences growth by influencing the transcription of target genes, but transcriptional targets that are not directly related to growth control have also been identified. A) Depicts genes and regulatory links identified in Drosophila. B) Depicts some of the genes identified in mammals. The Fat regulatory branch is shaded by a grey box to indicate that it is not yet known whether these genes actually influence Hpo signaling in mammals.</div></div>
