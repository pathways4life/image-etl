Glucose uptake in cells is regulated by Glut1 transporters that increase glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This is enhanced by cMyc regulation of glutamine uptake in cells. Growth factors influence metabolism through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalign pathway contribute to increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This is inhibited through PTEN. Under glucose limiting conditions, AMPK is activated inhibiting the mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, p53 activaiton inhibits glycolysis, and the mTOR pathway but increases oxidative phosphorylation. ROS increases through inefficient oxidative phosphorylation at the mitochondria.</div></div>
