(<b>b</b>) Brain slices were cut 2–3 weeks after virus injection and mCherry fluorescence was used to confirm Cre expression (right). L: lateral, A: anterior. i.c.: internal capsule. (<b>c</b>) Image of a brain slice from a Drd2-GFP;plexin-D1f/f mouse 2 weeks after AAV virus injection demonstrating sparse Cre expression (red) in both GFP positive (green) and negative neurons. (<b>d</b>) mEPSCs recorded from Cre+ direct and indirect pathway MSNs from plexin-D1f/f mice and plexin-D1f/+ control mice.

(<b>g</b>) Images of dendritic segments of Cre-expressing direct and indirect pathway MSNs in mice with one (top) or two (bottom) copies of the conditional plexin-D1 allele. The Cre+ direct pathway MSNs (red in <b>c</b>) in plexin-D1f/f animals show decreased spine density compared to those in virus-injected littermate controls (Cre+; plexin-D1f/+). In contrast, there is no detectable difference in spine density between Cre+ indirect pathway MSNs (yellow in <b>c</b>) in plexin-D1f/f and plexin-D1f/+ littermate control mice. (<b>h</b>) Summary of changes in direct and indirect pathway MSNs showing a significant difference in spine density between Cre+ plexin-D1f/f direct pathway MSNs and Cre+ plexin-D1f/+ heterozygous controls (*P&lt;0.05; Mann-Whitney).
