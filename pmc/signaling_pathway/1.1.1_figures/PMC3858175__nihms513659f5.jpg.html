From: HER-2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>, Acquisition of Growth Factor Independence, and Regulation of Biological Networks Associated with Cell Transformation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The progressive acquisition of HER-2–mediated transforming activity results in dramatic changes in downstream gene regulation affecting many different biological processes. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was performed on the genes regulated by EGFR/HER-2 signaling in the isogenic cell line series and grouped into the four biological categories based on the canonical pathways indicated in the figure. The set of bars on the far left indicates the number of common genes in each canonical pathway set that are regulated by EGFR/HER-2 signaling in all three cell lines. The middle set of bars indicates the number of common genes plus the number of genes in each canonical pathway set regulated by EGFR/HER-2 signaling in both HER-2–overexpressing lines, but not in MCF-10A cells. The set of bars on the right indicates the number of genes regulated in all three lines, plus the genes regulated in both HER-2–overexpressing lines, plus the genes regulated by HER-2/EGFR signaling in MCF-10HER2/E7 cells, but not the other two cell lines. Red bars show the number of genes positively regulated by signaling, and green bars indicate the number of genes negatively regulated by signaling.</div></div>
