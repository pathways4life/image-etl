Crosstalk between host pathways targeted by B. mallei virulence factors..  From: Mining Host-Pathogen Protein Interactions to Characterize Burkholderia mallei Infectivity Mechanisms. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A) The number of shared proteins and shared pathway protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among human proteins interacting with B. mallei that appeared in the focal adhesion pathway and in up to eight other molecular pathways that shared proteins (partially overlapped) with this pathway. The number of shared proteins across pathways was smaller than the number of shared pathway PPIs. B) The location and number of crosstalk interactions affected by B. mallei centered around the focal adhesion pathway and appear as arrows with line thicknesses proportional to the number of shared PPIs. The identity and number of virulence factors that target each pathway are illustrated using a word cloud. By preferentially targeting signaling pathways, the effect of one protein modulated through interaction with a virulence factor could propagate and disproportionally influence a larger number of biological processes.</div></div>
