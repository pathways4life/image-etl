Cells samples were pretreated with MnTmPyP or Tiron solution and then were treated with selenite or PBS for 24â€‰h. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blot for the molecules shown in the figures. (<b>b</b>) Western blot analysis of proteins extracted from tumor tissues using antibodies against critical molecules as indicated. (<b>c</b>) Selenite-mediated regulation of the PTEN/AKT/FoxO3a/Bim signaling pathway in vivo. Tumor tissues from a colon xenograft animal model were subjected to immunohistochemistry analysis using antibodies recognizing p-AKT (Thr308), AKT, p-FoxO3a (Ser253), FoxO3a, PTEN and Bim. Representative images from both control and selenite-treated samples are shown</div></div>
