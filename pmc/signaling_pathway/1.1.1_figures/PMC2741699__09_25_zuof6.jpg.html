From: CD151 Gene Delivery after Myocardial Infarction Promotes Functional Neovascularization and Activates FAK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for FAK-dependent mechanism for the effects of CD151. CD151, through formation of the CD151-integrin complex as a functional unit, activates signaling molecules. Overexpression of CD151 leads to the activation of FAK on Tyr397 and Tyr925. Subsequently, activated FAK397 activates the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway, and more NO is produced. Alternately, activated FAK397 and FAK925 contribute to the activation of the MAPK pathway, and ERK and JNK both are phosphorylated and activated. In this process, p38MAPK may not be involved. Whether CD151 promotes angiogenesis through activation of MAPKs remains to be tested.</div></div>
