Protein levels were determined by western blotting.(B) After 30 μM ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059 or 2 μM AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002 treatment for 6 days, protein levels of DNMT1 and TET1 were determined by western blotting.(C) After ERK pathway inhibition, mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR and normalized to DMSO control.(D) Adherent and soft-agar colony formation after ERK pathway or AKT pathway inhibition indicate that cellular transformation is mediated by the ERK pathway. Cells were pre-treated with inhibitors for 6 days and then tested for colony formation. All data are presented as mean ± SD. ns, no significant difference; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001 in comparison to V1 cells or DMSO treated control. See also Figure S2.</div></div>
