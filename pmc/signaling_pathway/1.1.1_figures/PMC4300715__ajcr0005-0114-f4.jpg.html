From: Effect of luteinizing hormone-induced prohibitin and matrix metalloproteinases on ovarian epithelial tumor cell proliferation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">LH regulated PHB, MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expression through AKT and ERK1/2 signal pathway. The cells were treated with or without 50 mIU/ml LH for 48 h in serum-free cultures after pre-treatment with 10 Î¼mol/L U0126 and LY294002 for 1 h, the protein expressions were investigated by western blot analysis. PBS treatment was used as a negative control. A. Shows ERK1/2 signaling inhibitor U0126 and AKT signaling inhibitor LY294002 block the up-regulation of prohibitin, MMP-2 and MMP-9 induced by LH in MCV152 cells. B. Shows ERK1/2 signaling inhibitor U0126 and AKT signaling inhibitor LY294002 block the up-regulation of prohibitin, MMP-2 and MMP-9 induced by LH in SKOV3 cells.</div></div>
