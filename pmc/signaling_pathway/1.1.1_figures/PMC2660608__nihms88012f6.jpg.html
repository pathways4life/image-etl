Rats received a single intradermal injection of 10 ng GDNF and 1 µg inhibitor for each signaling pathway. Readings of the mechanical nociceptive threshold were taken 30 min post-injection. As shown inhibitors of PLCγ (U73122, n = 6), PI3K (Wortmannin and LY294002, both n = 4), MEK 1/2 (U0126, n = 6), SFK (PP2 and SU6656, both n = 4) and CDK5 (Roscovitine, n = 6) all significantly attenuated GDNF hyperalgesia (all p&lt;0.001) whereas inhibitors to PKA (PKA inhibitor 6–22 amide, n=6) and PKC (Bisindolylmaleimide 1 hydrochloride, n=6) had no significant effect on GDNF hyperalgesia (p=1.000, in both cases). Note that 10% DMSO alone did not change paw-pressure threshold.</div></div>
