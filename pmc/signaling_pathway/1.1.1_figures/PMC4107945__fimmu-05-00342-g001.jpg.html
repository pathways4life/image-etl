RIG-I and MDA5 recognize a complementary set of cytosolic viral dsRNA ligands. Their activation is tightly regulated by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and host proteins such as LGP2. RIG-I and MDA5 signal to MAVS, which initiates the production of interferon signaling. Circled “P” indicates phosphorylation and slashed circled “P” indicates dephosphorylation.</div></div>
