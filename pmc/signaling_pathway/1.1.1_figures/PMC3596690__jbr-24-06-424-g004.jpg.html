The Western blotting were probed with phospho-specific antibodies against ATM (p-ATM), Chk1 (p-Chk1) and Chk2 (p-Chk2). B: TMZ induces focus formation by p-ATM in U251, but not in U251 (OTR). C and D, TMZ induces focus formation by p-Chk2 in D54 and U251, but not in their TMZ-resistant counterparts. The cells in B, C and D were analyzed at 72 h post TMZ treatment.
