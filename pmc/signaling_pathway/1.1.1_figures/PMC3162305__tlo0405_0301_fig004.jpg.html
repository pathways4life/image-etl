Within this pathway, the network of cell adhesion and extracellular remodeling is the most significantly upregulated network in VSCC. The latter was generated from critical genes most upregulated in the tumor samples, depicting the major nodes of MMPs 1, 2, and 13 and their interactors. Red depicts the genes that are upregulated in tumor samples. The intensity of the colors indicates the magnitude of regulation.</div></div>
