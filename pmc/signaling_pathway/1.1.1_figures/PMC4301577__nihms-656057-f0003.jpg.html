An increased concentration of TGFβ is detected by 3 months in both the stomach and serum of GKO animals compared to BL/6 mice. (<b>C</b>) Whole bone marrow isolated from 6 month BL/6 and GKO mice shows significantly more phospho-Smad3 in the GKO versus BL/6 group, indicating TGFβ signaling pathway activation.
