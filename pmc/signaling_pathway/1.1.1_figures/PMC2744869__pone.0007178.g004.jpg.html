From: SOCS2 Influences LPS Induced Human Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cell Maturation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Enriched monocytes were cultured in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 for 6 days. iDCs were transfected with SOCS2 siRNA or control siRNA and incubated for 24 hours. Cells were further incubated with LPS (200 ng/ml) for additional 2 h. LPS inducible gene mRNA expressions were measured by real-time PCR. (A). LPS inducible gene expression of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and CCL-4 via the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. (B) LPS inducible gene expression of IFN-β, CXCL-9, CXCL-10 via the MyD88-independent signaling pathway. Data shown are the mean of triplicate sample, and are representative of at least two donors with similar results. Values for the control were set to 1.
