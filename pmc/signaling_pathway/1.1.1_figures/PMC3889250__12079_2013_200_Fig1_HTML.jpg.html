The BDNF signaling pathway map contains 129 molecules for which the PPIs, PTMs, translocation and activation/inhibition reactions are experimentally proven in BDNF signaling. The major signaling modules activated by BDNF include PI3K/AKT, RAS/ERK, PLC/PKC, AMPK/ACC and JAK/STAT pathways. These signaling events in neurons lead to various context-specific processes such as growth, cell proliferation, differentiation, maintenance of synaptic plasticity, microtubule assembly, fat metabolism, protection, survival, calcification, production of nitric oxide and apoptosis. This pathway map is made publicly available at (http://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2380). A high confidence version of this map is available at http://www.netpath.org/netslim/BDNF_pathway.html </div></div>
