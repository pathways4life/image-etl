The transition from neural plate to spinal cord is accompanied by the appearance of Ca2+ spikes, which intercalate in the Shh-signaling pathway to down-regulate Gli activity. This switch off of the canonical Shh pathway is implemented at several levels including regulation of Gli subcellular localization, posttranslational processing, and transcriptional repression, all converging in inhibiting Gli activity.</div></div>
