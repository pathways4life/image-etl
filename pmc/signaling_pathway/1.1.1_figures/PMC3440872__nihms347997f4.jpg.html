Yap promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation through activation of IGF signaling and stabilization of the active form of β-catenin. Inhibition of IGF signaling or β-catenin blocks Yap-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Yap interlinks the Hippo pathway (MST1/2 and LATS1/2), the Wnt pathway [Wnt, Disheveled (Dvl), Axin, APC, and GSK-3β], and the IGF pathway (IGF, IGF1R, PI3K, Akt, and GSK-3β) to control β-catenin signaling and regulate cardiac growth and development. Each of the three pathways influenced by Yap is demarcated by a box.</div></div>
