From: Angiotensin II Contributes to Podocyte Injury by Increasing TRPC6 Expression via an NFAT-Mediated Positive Feedback <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed signaling pathway that regulates the in AngII-dependent TRPC6 expression in podocytes. Results from our study together with previously published data 57  suggest the existence of the following signaling pathways in podocytes mediating AngII-induced TRPC6 expression and podocyte injury. AT1R stimulation by AngII results in Ca2+ influx at least in part mediated by TRPC6. Ca2+-dependent calcineurin activation leads to activation and nuclear translocation of NFAT, which enhances transcription of NFAT-responsive genes such as TRPC6. A consequent increase in TRPC6 protein expression at the cell membrane could result in a positive feedback regulatory circuit, because Ca2+ influx through TRPC6 itself appears to be involved in the signaling pathway leading to increased TRPC6 expression. Our studies show that NFAT activation per se is sufficient to induce TRPC6 transcription and proteinuria. Hypothetically, the proposed feedback mechanism could also result in a persistent calcineurin activation, which was previously demonstrated to lead to the dephosphorylation and degradation of the actin-binding protein synaptopodin (dashed box). 57  The latter was shown to result in cytoskeletal rearrangement and, eventually, proteinuria. Possibly, the latter pathway is involved in the generation of podocyte injury subsequent to AngII-induced TRPC6 expression.</div></div>
