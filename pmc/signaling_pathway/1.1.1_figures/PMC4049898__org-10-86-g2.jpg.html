Ciliogenesis depends on anterograde and retrograde transport involving kinesin II, dynein 2 and IFT proteins. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway (left side of figure) initiates when a Wnt ligand binds to a Frizzled receptor in the presence of LRP. This activates Dishevelled that inhibits the β-catenin destruction complex (GSK3β, APC, Axin). In the active pathway, β-catenin accumulates in the cytosol and causes the transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes. In the non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling pathway in the kidney (right side of figure), the binding of a Wnt ligand will result in the activation of Frizzled and Dishevelled, leading to downstream cytoskeletal rearrangements or transcriptional activation through the activation of RhoA or Rac1. Core molecules (Vangl, Celsr, Scribble) are important for non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling, while effector PCP molecules (Fuzzy, Fat4, Ptk7) are significant for kidney morphogenesis. A number of Wnt signaling proteins localize to the basal body (Dishevelled, β-catenin, Fat4) or base (Inversin, Dishevelled, Frizzled, Vangl) of kidney primary cilia.</div></div>
