Both pathways could mediate important functions of BMP/TGFβ in skeletogenesis. The non-Smad pathways also regulate Smad proteins by modulating linker region and C-terminal phosphorylation. Moreover, Smad proteins also modulate activities of molecules in Non-Smad pathways. The preference of intracellular pathways by different receptor complexes, the crosstalk between these two pathways, and the exact signaling mechanisms of the Non-Smad pathways in skeletal system remain to be investigated.</div></div>
