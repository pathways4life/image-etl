Ectopic expression of MT2A could induce upregulation of IκB-α in mRNA and protein levels, as well as down-regulation of p-IκB-α and cyclin D1expression. Moreover, MT2A could be one of the transcriptional factors to induce the activity of IκB-α promoter, which indicates that MT2A is the negative regulator in NF-κB signaling pathway.</div></div>
