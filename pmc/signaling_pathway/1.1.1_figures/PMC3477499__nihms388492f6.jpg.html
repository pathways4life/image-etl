Representative western blots showing Beclin-1 and LC3 protein in cardiomyocytes from non-diabetic (Con) and type 2 diabetic (db/db) under basal conditions and in response to glucose deprivation (A) and in Con cells subjected to glucose deprivation in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or glucosamine (GlcN) (B). Inhibition of the HBP by 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) in glucose deprived db/db cardiomyocytes restores Beclin-1 and LC3 signaling (C). Calsequestrin (Csq) is an internal protein loading control.</div></div>
