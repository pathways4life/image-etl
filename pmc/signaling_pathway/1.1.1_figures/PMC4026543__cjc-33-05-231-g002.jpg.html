From: The role of EPH receptors in cancer-related epithelial-mesenchymal transition. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">EPH receptors initiate forward signaling to promote cancer progression via the MAPK signaling pathway in both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent manners. EPHRIN-mediated reverse signaling also contributes to tumorigenicity by inhibiting apoptosis. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway promotes tumor progression by up-regulating EPHB4 and down-regulating EPHB2, whereas EPHB3 inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway. EPHA2 promotes EMT through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
