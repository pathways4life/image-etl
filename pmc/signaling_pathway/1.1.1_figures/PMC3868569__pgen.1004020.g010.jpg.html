Model for the regulation of TATN-1 expression, tyrosine levels, and the resulting effects of tyrosine effects on cell <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways..  From: TATN-1 Mutations Reveal a Novel Role for Tyrosine as a Metabolic Signal That Influences Developmental Decisions and Longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Shown is the daf-2/IGFR signaling pathway and eak genes from Figure 1A with the addition, shown in blue, of the effects of tyrosine identified in this work and the control of TATN-1 expression by daf-2/IGFR signaling and by dietary and environmental cues as demonstrated in Figure 8. In summary, worms sense the available diet and environmental temperature and these factors both contribute to the dauer decision and the regulation of TATN-1 protein levels. Conditions which promote the dauer decision also tend to reduce the expression of TATN-1. The reductions in TATN-1 expression lead to reduced removal of tyrosine through degradation and increase free tyrosine levels in the animal. These increases in tyrosine activate aak-2/AMPK and disrupt the effects of normal daf-2/IGFR signaling through positive effects on daf-16/FOXO and perhaps inhibitory effects on crh-1/CREB. The effects of tyrosine are particularly pronounced when the daf-2/IGFR pathway is compromised, such as through mutations in the daf-2/IGFR gene or the eak genes which lie in a parallel pathway. This may be due to further reductions in TATN-1 expression or reductions in inhibitory regulators of daf-16/FOXO activity.</div></div>
