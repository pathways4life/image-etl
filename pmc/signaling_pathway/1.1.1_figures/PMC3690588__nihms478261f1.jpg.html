A simplified diagram ofWnt β-catenin dependent and independent signaling: <b>a</b> β-catenin-dependent pathway: β-catenin dependent signaling is initiated by binding of Wnts to frizzled seven transmembrane receptors. This binding leads to a series of events culminating in deactivation of a multi-protein β-catenin destruction complex. Subsequently, hypophosphorylated β-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it binds TCF/LEF transcription factors to regulate gene expression. <b>b</b> Wnt β-catenin independent/calcium pathway. Wnts binding to frizzled lead to calcium influx, which activates calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and NFAT. NFAT binds to its cognate target gene to regulate gene expression. <b>c</b> Wnt β-catenin independent/planar cell polarity pathway: Wnt binding to frizzled leads to Rac/Rho activation and subsequently to activation of kinases such as JNK that modulates cytoskeletal rearrangements.
