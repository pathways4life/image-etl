From: E-selectin ligand-1 controls circulating prostate cancer cell rolling/adhesion and metastasis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>(A)</b> Western blot analysis of key molecules of RAS-MAP kinase signaling pathway from cell lysate of shESL-1 and scESL-1 of PC-3 cells (left panel) and prostate tissues from the orthotopic mice receiving rolling and floating PC-3 cells (right panel). They are ESL-1, nRAS, total MEK, phosphoMEK, total ERK1/2, phosphoERK1/2, and its downstream transcription factor, cFOS antibody. GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene. <b>(B)</b> Integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration PCR array. Cell adhesion and migration PCR array was performed to compare the cytoskeleton gene expression in scESL-1 and shESL-1 PC-3 cell line. Bar graph represents the relative fold expression of 3 clusters of genes representing Actin, Myosin, and Rho family.</div></div>
