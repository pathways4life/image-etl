U937-mock and U937-NDRG2 cells were treated with 0.1Âµg/ml PMA for 48 h. (A) Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gels, and Western blot analysis was performed using specific antibodies. Actin was used as an internal loading control. (B, C) mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR.</div></div>
