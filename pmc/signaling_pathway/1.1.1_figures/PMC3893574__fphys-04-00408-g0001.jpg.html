IGF-1 increases the activity of Akt protein. This activation of Akt is attenuated by PTEN. The activated state of Akt stimulates protein synthesis through mTOR. Akt also inhibits protein degradation by suppressing the activity of GSK3Î² and FoxO1, which induces protein degradation by activating the expression of MuRF1 and Atrogin1. Therefore, the IGF-1/Akt pathway induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Recent studies have shown that miR-1, miR-133, miR-206, and miR-128a negatively regulate the IGF-1/Akt pathway by targeting positive regulators of the IGF-1/Akt pathway (IGF-1, IGF-1R, IRS1, HSP70, or p70S6K), while miR-29, miR-486, and miR-23a positively regulate this pathway by targeting negative regulators (PTEN, FoxO1, MuRF1, or Atrogin1). In contrast to the IGF-1/Akt pathway, myostatin signaling is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. Myostatin activates Smad3 protein and may inhibit protein synthesis by repressing the transcription of miR-486 and miR-29, which target PTEN and FoxO1 proteins. Conversely, myostatin expression is regulated by miR-27a/b, miR-208a/b, and miR-499. Red lines indicate the inhibitory function of miRNAs identified in skeletal muscle, while red-dashed lines represent the inhibitory function of miRNAs identified in cardiac muscle and cultured cells.</div></div>
