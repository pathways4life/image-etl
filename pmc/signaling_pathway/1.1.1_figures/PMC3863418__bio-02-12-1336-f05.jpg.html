Data are represented as mean ± SEM. *P&lt;0.05, Student's t-test. (B–E) Immunofluorescent staining for Notch1 in the skin of E14.5, E16.5 and E18.5 wild-type and E18.5 K5-Ets1 BT embryos (all green). (F–K) Immunofluorescent staining for Notch2, Notch3 and Hes1 in the skin of E18.5 wild-type and K5-Ets1 BT embryos (all green). White arrows point to membrane-associated staining of Notch2 and Notch3. Each section was co-stained with TOPRO-3 to mark nuclei (blue). Scale bars in all cases are 37.5 µm.</div></div>
