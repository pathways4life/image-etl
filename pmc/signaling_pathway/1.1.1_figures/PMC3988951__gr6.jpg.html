(A) Network depiction of the TREM2-containing module in HIPP, showing all genes connected with a topological overlap measure (TOM) &gt;0.10. TREM2 is highlighted in red, together with all of the genes that are directly connected to it, based on the TOM cut-off used. Genes that are featured in our proposed TREM2 signaling pathway are boxed in blue. (B) Network depiction of the TREM2-containing module in CRBL, showing all genes connected with a TOM &gt;0.10. As above, TREM2 is highlighted in red, together with the genes that are directly connected to it, based on the TOM cut-off used. Genes that are featured in our proposed TREM2 signalling pathway are boxed in blue. (C) Proposed TREM2-signaling pathway in human brain adapted from the KEGG pathways for “Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis” and “Systemic lupus erythematosus.” Genes/complexes highlighted by data-driven network analyses are boxed in blue.</div></div>
