Total cell extracts were made and used directly for Western blot analysis. A, the insulin phosphorylation response of proteins in the insulin signaling pathway (n = 3). B, the IGF-1 phosphorylation response of proteins in the insulin signaling pathway (n = 3). Total protein levels for the various insulin time points can be seen in supplemental Fig. S4. Con, control; ut, untreated.</div></div>
