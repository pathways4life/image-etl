From: Model composition through model reduction: a combined model of CD95 and NF-?B <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>The original model by Neumann </b><b>et al. </b><b>and results of the model reduction. A.</b> The original model decomposed into modules according to three steps of the CD95 signaling pathways: activation of caspase-8, pro-apoptotic pathway resulting in caspase-3 activation and anti-apoptotic pathway regulated by NF-ÎºB. The species retained during the model reduction are colored; reactions are represented by solid lines. <b>B.</b> The modular view of the model. Activation of caspase-8 and p43-FLIP (product of cFLIPL cleavage) occurs at the DISC complex and triggers simultaneous processes of cell death and survival.</div></div>
