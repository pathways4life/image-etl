(A) Viral infections are sensed by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which in turn recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger antiviral responses. RIG-I identifies the 5′-3p RNA, and then interacts with MAVS to activate the IFN responses factor 3 (IRF3). In MAMs (mitochondrial-associated membranes), MAVS also interacts with STING that locates at the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), and induces the ubiquitination and dimerization of STING. The activated STING recruits TBK1 and IRF3 and contributes to the phosphorylation of IRF3 mediated by TBK1. STING recruits TBK1 and IKKε and forms the TBK1-IKKε complex via the association with TRAF3. The TBK1 complex induces the phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of IRF3. (B) When SARS-CoV invades the host, these processes are disrupted by SARS-CoV PLpro-TM. PLpro-TM disrupts activation of the IRF3 pathway induced by STING-TRAF3-TBK1 by blocking the assembly of the complex, and it deubiquitinates the signaling molecules RIG-I, TRAF3, STING, TBK1, and IRF3</div></div>
