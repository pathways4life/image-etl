From: Dysregulation of mTOR activity through LKB1 inactivation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Environmental stress leads to the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by liver kinase B1 (LKB1), which subsequently activates hamartin (TSC1)/tuberin (TSC2) complex. The activation of this pathway down-regulates mTOR activity, which leads to cell growth arrest. mTOR activity can also be regulated by growth factors through the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway.</div></div>
