From: Apelin Ameliorates TNF-?-Induced Reduction of Glycogen Synthesis in the Hepatocytes through G Protein-Coupled Receptor APJ. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">An intraperitoneal injection of 20 nmol/kg apelin-13 led to increased glycogen level in liver tissues of C57BL/6J mice treated by TNF-α (A). Moreover, insulin signaling pathway was impaired in liver tissues treated with TNF-α. These changes of JNK, IRS-1, AKT and GSK induced by TNF-α were reversed via apelin injection (B).
