Five to 11 weeks old mice were shaved and treated daily for 8 consecutive days with either Hh signaling pathway agonist or vehicle solution. Both wild-type and VdrKO mice display hair growth following treatment with the agonist where as vehicle wild-type and agonist treated Rhinomice do not.Pictures were taken at the beginning of the treatment (day 1), after the end of the treatment (day 9) and at subsequent days 15 and 22 to monitor hair growth.</div></div>
