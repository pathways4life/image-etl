In the classical pathway, the classical stimulators like TNFα bind to receptor, leading to recruitment of the adaptor molecule TRADD and the signaling proteins TRAF2 and RIP1. TRAF2 recruits the IKK complex that phosphorylates IκBα at serine residue 32 and 36, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, allowing the release of the classical heterodimer of p65/p50, which then translocate to the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes. In the non-classical pathway, NIK-induced phosphorylation of IKKα leads to the phosphorylation of p100 and proteasome-mediated processing of p100 into p52, allowing the nuclear translocation of RelB/p52 to regulate target gene expression. In the atypical pathway, the p38-activated casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylates IκBα at a cluster of serine residues within C-terminal domain, while oxidative stress induces spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα at tyrosine residue (Y-42) within N-terminal domain.</div></div>
