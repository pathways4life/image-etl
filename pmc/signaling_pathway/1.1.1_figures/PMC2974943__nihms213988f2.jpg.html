From: Regulation of Facial Morphogenesis by Endothelin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>: Insights from Mice and Fish. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Intracellular signaling pathway within cranial neural crest cells mediated by endothelin-1 (Edn1). Preproendothelin-1 coming from cells within the pharyngeal arch environment undergoes two processing events (Furin A/B and endothelin converting enzyme 1/2 (Ece1, 2) before binding to the endothelin-A receptor (Ednra). This initiates signaling through Gαq/Gα11, resulting in phospholipase-β3 activity (Plcβ3) and thus changes in gene expression. Genetic evidence that individual Edn1/Ednra pathway members regulate craniofacial development has come from either mouse (highlighted in orange), zebrafish (highlighted in blue) or both (highlighted in orange/blue).</div></div>
