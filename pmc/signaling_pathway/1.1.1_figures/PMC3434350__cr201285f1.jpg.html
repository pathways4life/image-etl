Multiple cellular pathways are regulated by signaling from mTOR complexes, including regulation of autophagy, lipid metabolism, and control of actin cytoskeleton in addition to the regulation of translation. Translational control by mTOR is regulated predominantly by signaling from mTORC1, and mediated by phosphorylation of 4E-BPs and S6K, which directly influence the function of eIF4E and RpS6, respectively. Now, two papers by Hsieh et al. and Thoreen et al. demonstrate that mTOR signaling to the ribosome can regulate a specific subset of mRNA transcripts, the majority of which contain a 5′ TOP, a 5′ TOP-like or a novel PRTE element in their 5′ UTR regions. While Thoreen et al. now establish an important mTOR-sensitive regulation of eIF4G1 downstream of 4E-BPs, Hsieh et al. focus on a subset of mRNA transcripts (YB-1, CD44, MTA1 and vimentin) strongly linked to regulation of metastasis, and propose that they play a role in the progression of Pten-loss-driven prostate cancer through hyperactivation of the mTOR signaling pathway. While, the ATP site inhibitor INK128 was shown to inhibit tumor progression in mice, it should be noted that such inhibitors also block all activities of mTORC1 and 2, and while they can successfully block the translational up-regulation of the 4-gene metastasis signature described by Hsieh et al., they also block other metastatic pathways regulated by independently controlled mTOR pathways.</div></div>
