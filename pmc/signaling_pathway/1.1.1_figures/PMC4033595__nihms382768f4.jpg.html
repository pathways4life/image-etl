(A) Venn diagram illustrating the number of specific and common genes regulated by the two ERα mutants. (B) Gene ontology analysis (IPA) for significant canonical pathways. A, arylhydrocarbon receptor signaling; B, tumoricidal function of hepatic natural killer cells; C, LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function; D, IL-6 signaling; E, dendritic cell maturation; F, communication between innate and adaptive immune cells; G, OX40 signaling pathway; H, regulation of IL-2 expression in activated and anergic T lymphocytes; I, CTLA4 signaling in cytotoxic T lymphocytes; J, T helper cell differentiation; K, IL-9 signaling; L, CD28 signaling in T helper cells; M, ICOs-ICOSL signaling in T helper cells; N, Crosstalk between dendritic cells and natural killer cells; O, PKCδ signaling in T lymphocytes; P, MSP-ROH signaling pathway; Q, antigen presentation pathway. Bars in darker blue and in lighter blue represent signaling pathways that were regulated by ERα S121A and ERα S212D, respectively.</div></div>
