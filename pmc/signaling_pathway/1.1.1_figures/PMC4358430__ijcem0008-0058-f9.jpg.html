From: AMPK is required for PM2.5-induced autophagy in human lung epithelial A549 cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic diagram describing PM2.5 induced autophagy mediated by the AMPK pathway. PM2.5 exposure in A549 cells causes the activation of AMPK, potentially through the ROS signaling pathway, which subsequently leads to autophagy. The AKT, MAPK and p53 signaling pathways are also activated, with an inhibitory effect by the AKT, ERK and p38 pathways and no apparent effect on autophagy by JNK and p53 signaling pathways. These results suggest there is a balance of activating and inhibitory pathways, and that activating pathways (ROS and AMPK) predominately regulate the response to PM2.5 to promote an overall induction of autophagy. The DNA damage induced by PM2.5 also activates apoptosis, which is counteracted in part by the induction of autophagy.</div></div>
