From: CARD9 Mediates Dectin-2-induced I?B? Kinase Ubiquitination Leading to Activation of NF-?B in Response to Stimulation by the Hyphal Form of Candida albicans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>The model for C. albicans-induced signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation.</b> The hyphal form of C. albicans recognizes Dectin-2, whereas yeast and β-glucans, such as zymosan, activate Dectin-1. Although both Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 pathways are required for Syk that regulates IKK phosphorylation, CARD9 and Bcl10 are selectively involved in Dectin-2-induced signaling cascades leading to regulation of NEMO ubiquitination. The phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IKK in the Dectin-2-induced signaling pathway are required for activation of the IKK complex for NF-κB activation. LPS and other TLR ligands activate NF-κB through a MyD88-dependent but CARD9-independent pathway.</div></div>
