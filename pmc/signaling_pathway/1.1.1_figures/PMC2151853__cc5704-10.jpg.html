From: Hyperoxia increases ventilator-induced lung injury via mitogen-activated protein kinases: a prospective, controlled animal experiment. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Differences in signaling pathway activation with lung stretch with mechanical ventilation with and without hyperoxia. Activation of the JNK pathway was involved in ventilator-induced neutrophil infiltration, cytokine production, and microvascular permeability with and without hyperoxia. Both ERK and JNK were involved in airway epithelial cell apoptosis with and without hyperoxia. The major difference in the signaling pathway activation was that ERK1/2 activation was involved in increased MIP-2 production and neutrophil infiltration only in mice exposed to high-tidal volume ventilation with hyperoxia, and not in mice exposed to high-tidal volume ventilation without hyperoxia. JNK activation was involved with and without hyperoxia. ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MIP-2, macrophage inflammatory protein-2.</div></div>
