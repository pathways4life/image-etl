(A) HeLa cells stably expressing vector control, WT-IRS1, or Myr-IRS1 were transfected with control or CNK1-siRNAs prior to serum starvation and insulin treatment. Lysates were prepared and examined by immunoblot analysis. (B) HeLa cells stably expressing PDGFR were transfected with control or CNK1-siRNAs prior to serum starvation and treatment with either insulin or PDGF. Lysates or membrane fractions were prepared and examined by immunoblot analysis. (C) Model for CNK1 function in insulin signaling (see the text for details).</div></div>
