While the dominant mode of signaling for both CRF receptors signaling is Gs-coupled AC-PKA cascade, they may also signal via the PLC-PKC and ERK-MAPK cascades. CRF receptor AC-PKA signaling is stringently regulated by GRK- and arrestin-mediated homologous desensitization. Although the mechanisms regulating CRF receptor ERK-MAPK signaling are not yet fully understood, this pathway may potentiate BDNF-stimulated TrkB receptor function.
