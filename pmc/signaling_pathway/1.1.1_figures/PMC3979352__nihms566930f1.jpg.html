From: Targeting leucine addiction and autophagy in melanoma. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Melanoma cells with mutations in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway are sensitive to combine therapy of leucine deprivation and inhibition of autophagy. In normal cells, the mTORC1 complex is a sensor of nutrient levels, and nutrient starvation induces its inhibition-activating autophagy, which in turn replenishes nutrient levels. In melanoma cells, however, the hyperactivation of the RAS/MAPK pathway cells keeps mTORC1 active and therefore autophagy is not turned on, which induces apoptosis.</div></div>
