During lung branching morphogenesis, the two primary buds initially elongate and later bulge to generate the secondary buds. Localized Fgf10 (green) expression in the distal mesenchyme induces primary bud formation. The mechanisms by which Fgf10 expression is initiated and localized are not clear. Shh (blue) is expressed in the epithelium and is up-regulated at the distal tips of the primary buds. In this model, in the wild-type lung, secondary bud formation is also induced by localized Fgf10 expression in the mesenchyme corresponding to the future sites of secondary bud formation. It is likely that similar mechanisms (indicated by a question mark in the diagram) are used to localize Fgf10 to these sites. Epithelial expression of Hh may help restrict Fgf10 expression to the sites of secondary bud formation by inhibiting Fgf10 expression. The Hh pathway transcriptionally activates Hip1 (gray) and Ptch1 (not shown), antagonists of Hh signaling, to down-regulate the Hh pathway at the sites of bud formation. As a result, the signals that activate Fgf10 expression overcome the mild inhibition (broken line), if any, by Hh signaling. In contrast, in the interbud regions, the Hh pathway effectively inhibits Fgf10 expression. In the Hip1 mutant lung, there is a uniform up-regulation of the Hh pathway along the entire epithelium due to the absence of negative regulation by Hip1. Consequently, high levels of Hh inhibit Fgf10 expression and disrupt secondary bud formation. Thus, Hip1's negative regulation of the Hh pathway is necessary to ensure proper secondary bud formation.</div></div>
