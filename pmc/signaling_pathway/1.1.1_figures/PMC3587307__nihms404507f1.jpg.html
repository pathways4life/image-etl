Although the mechanism by which ERK1/2 is inhibited is unclear, one possibility could be through the sequestration of ERK1/2 to the nuclear periphery. Emerin has been shown to play a role in two different signaling cascades. First, it negatively regulates Wnt signaling by preventing accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus, presumably by stimulating export of β-catenin. Second, emerin negatively regulates ERK signaling through unclear mechanisms. MAN1 negatively regulates TGF-β signaling by sequestering R-Smads away from gene targets. <b>(B)</b> During myogenesis, NET39 acts as a repressor of the mTOR-IGF-II signaling pathway. NET39 blocks IGF-II transcription by inhibiting mTOR activity at the NE. NET37, an INM protein with glycosidase activity promotes myogenesis by activating AKT signaling through the maturation and secretion of IGF-II in the PNS/ER.</div></div>
