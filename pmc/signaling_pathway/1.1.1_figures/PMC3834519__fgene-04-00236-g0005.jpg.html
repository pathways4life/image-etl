From: Genome-wide multi-omics profiling of colorectal cancer identifies immune determinants strongly associated with relapse. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Pathway analysis of top variants from exome sequencing data</b>. Three pathways highly enriched with non-synonymous variants found exclusively in relapse patients are shown. <b>(A)</b> Antigen presentation pathway affected in 8 relapse cases shown. Variants with predicted activation effect were mapped predominantly to one branch of pathway related to activation of CD4+ Lymphocytes. <b>(B)</b> PKC-Theta Signaling in T-Lymphocytes affected in 14 relapse cases shown. <b>(C)</b> PTEN Signaling affected in 14 relapse cases shown.</div></div>
