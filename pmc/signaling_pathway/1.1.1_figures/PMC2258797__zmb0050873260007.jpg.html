TRH stimulation activates the MEK1-ERK signaling pathway, resulting in up-regulation of nuclear CDK9 and cyclin T1/CDK9 complex (i.e., P-TEFb). This up-regulation may be caused by stabilization or translocation of CDK9. The up-regulated P-TEFb is subsequently recruited on IEGs (c-fos, junB, MKP-1, etc.), probably through transcription activators or chromatin-associated proteins. On IEGs, P-TEFb phosphorylates CTR of Spt5, NELF, and CTD Ser-2 of Pol II, favoring transcription elongation and maturation of mRNA by the Pol II complex associated with P-TEFb and DSIF.</div></div>
