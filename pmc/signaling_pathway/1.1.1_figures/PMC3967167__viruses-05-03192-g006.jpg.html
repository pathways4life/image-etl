Early activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway during the first contact with the cell or a few minutes after entry can lead to both short-term cellular answers to facilitate viral entry and long-term reactions (lasting for hours or even days) to support viral and cellular splicing, viral translation and cell survival. Later activation, hours or days post-infection, can likewise promote such long-term effects.</div></div>
