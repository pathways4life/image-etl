Activities of the ERK1/2- or the JNK signaling pathways were determined by western blotting with pThr183/pTyr185 ERK1/2- or pThr183/pTyr185 JNK-specific antibodies (pERK1/2 or pJNK, respectively). The membranes were re-probed to monitor the levels of total ERK1/2 or JNK. In addition, GAPDH levels were determined to provide additional loading control. <b>B, C</b>, Relative levels of the phospho-MAP-kinases (pMAPK) were determined as fold controls of the pERK/ERK- or pJNK/JNK ratios, respectively. In CPDD-, or ActD-treated neurons, the ERK1/2- but not the JNK pathway is activated. In both cases, the ERK1/2 activation was delayed and long lasting suggesting deficient inactivation of ERK1/2.
