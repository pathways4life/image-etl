The known components of the combined pathway are shown in black. The new pathway described in this work is shown in blue. The main second messengers are indicated in green. Negative regulators of T-cell signaling operating in this pathway are shown in red. Thicker arrows highlight the prevalence of the Vav1/RasGRP1 pathway over the rest of signaling connections presented in this figure. For the sake of simplicity, we have not included adaptor proteins and kinases involved in the pathway. Likewise, we have omitted other transcriptional factors that cooperate in the transcription of NF-AT-regulated genes. The direct connection between Rac1 and RasGRP1 is based on previous observations indicating that the polymerization of F-actin by Rac1 contributes to the translocation of RasGRP family members to the plasma membrane (11, 12). Other regulatory points are discussed in the main text.</div></div>
