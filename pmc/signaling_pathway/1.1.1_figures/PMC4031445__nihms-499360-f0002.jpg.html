In response to PGE2, EP2 receptor mediates both G protein-dependent and -independent signaling pathways to conduct multiple beneficial and deleterious actions. We hypothesize that the EP2 receptor mediates cellular survival and neuroplasticity mainly via cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway, but inflammation and neurotoxicity via cAMP/Epac/Rap signaling, and cell proliferation and migration via Î²-arrestin. Signaling cross-talk occurs among these three EP2 downstream pathways, but only the major pathways and effects are indicated.</div></div>
