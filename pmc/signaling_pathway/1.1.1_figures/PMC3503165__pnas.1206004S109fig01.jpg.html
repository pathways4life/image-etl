(Upper) Plot of significant DNA amplifications in colorectal cancers reveals amplification on chromosome 13 pinpointing CDX2. (Lower) Schematic model summarizing data indicating that CDX2, when amplified, promotes Wnt/β-catenin signaling by regulating transcript levels of Wnt signaling pathway genes (Left) and by enhancing expression of Wnt pathway target genes by β-catenin (Right).</div></div>
