From: Gene expression and network-based analysis reveals a novel role for hsa-miR-9 and drug control over the p38 network in glioblastoma multiforme progression. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>hsa-miR-9 regulation of the p38 pathway</b>. <b>(a) </b>Distribution of p38 signaling pathway activity levels across groups. Group 1 (blue, higher survival rates) has low pathway activity, and group 2 (green, lower survival rates) has higher activity levels. This figure demonstrates the large range in the activity levels between groups, and the distinct difference between them. <b>(b) </b>The p38 signaling network. Genes highlighted in blue are in the p38 signaling pathway, and the genes in red boxes are those found by PITA to be possibly targeted by hsa-miR-9. <b>(c) </b>Correlation between hsa-miR-9 and p38 pathway levels. Group 1 (blue dots) has a significant, strong negative correlation between miRNA expression levels and pathway activity while group 2 (green dots) has a lower correlation value. The groups presented here are based on the p38 survival groups.</div></div>
