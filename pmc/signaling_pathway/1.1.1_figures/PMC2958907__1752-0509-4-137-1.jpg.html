Snapshot of the pathway navigator that displays a selected view of the DC signaling map. Entities are clickable, such that corresponding annotations, namely the interactions in which those entities are involved, and the related PMIDs are displayed in the bottom left-hand frame. Additionally, other frames include an Interaction list, a Protein list, a Gene list, and an RNA list. Hyperlinks to the relevant NCBI Entrez Gene page(s) and DC wiki pages are also provided. A zoom rectangle located in the upper left corner of the image facilitates navigation through the pathway.</div></div>
