From: Nonhuman Primate Calorie Restriction. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Calorie restriction (CR) is not mechanistically equivalent to lifespan extension by genetic manipulation leading to reduced insulin signaling.</b> The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway has been implicated in regulating longevity in numerous species. Transgenic, knockout, and mutant genetic variants have demonstrated that reduced signaling through this axis can increase lifespan in yeast (glucose signaling pathway), worms, flies, and mice. Studies of CR in these species reveal that there is evidence to support reduced signaling through this axis as an outcome of CR, but that the pathways for lifespan extension are not identical and that other factors distinct from insulin/insulin-like growth factor play a role in the mechanism of CR.</div></div>
