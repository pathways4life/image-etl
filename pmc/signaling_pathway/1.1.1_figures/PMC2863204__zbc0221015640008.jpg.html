Several signaling pathways affected by LRP1 expression are phosphorylation states of MAPK pathway-related proteins (A) and cell cycle-related proteins (B). *, mean values significantly larger than that of LRP1+/− or B41 cells (p &lt; 0.05); **, mean values significantly smaller than that of LRP1+/− or B41 cells (p &lt; 0.05).</div></div>
