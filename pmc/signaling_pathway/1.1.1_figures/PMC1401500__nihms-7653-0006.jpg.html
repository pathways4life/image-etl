BSA (50μg/ml) at 30 mins does not induce such phosphorylation. (B) AGE-induced phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 is blocked by a neutralizing rabbit anti-RAGE Ab (10 μg/ml), but not by the isotype control rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml), confirming the involvement of RAGE in the signaling pathway. Furthermore, addition of inhibitors to ERK1/2 (PD98059, 10μM) or p38 (SB203580, 10 μM) and infection with Adv-DN-ERK1/2 or Adv-DN-p38 (MOI of 50) also inhibit AGE-induced ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation respectively, while the control Adv-β-gal (MOI of 50) does not, confirming the efficacy of the dominant negative constructs. BSA (50 μg/ml) has no effect on either ERK1/2 or p38 phosphorylation.</div></div>
