From: FIP200, a key <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> node to coordinately regulate various cellular processes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">FIP200 functions to regulate diverse cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell spreading, cell migration, cell growth and cell survival. FIP200 suppresses cell proliferation by regulation of p53-p21, Cyclin D1, Rb1 and FAK pathways; FIP200 negatively regulates cell spreading and migration by its inhibition of FAK function; FIP200 promotes mTOR activation and cell growth through its interaction with TSC1-TSC2 complex; FIP200 positively regulates cell survival by its inhibition of Pyk2 activity and regulation of TNFÎ±-JNK signaling cascade (see text for details).</div></div>
