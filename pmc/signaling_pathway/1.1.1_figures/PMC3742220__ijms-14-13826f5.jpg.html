Raldh2 expression was not significantly different in FABP3-MO injected zebrafish, as visualized by in situ hybridization at 14 hpf (<b>B</b>) and 24 hpf (<b>D</b>), compared with Wt controls at 14 hpf (<b>A</b>) and 24 hpf (<b>C</b>), respectively. Stable expression levels of Raldh2 were also confirmed by real-time PCR (<b>E</b>). Cyp26a1 expression was significantly upregulated in FABP3-MO injected zebrafish, as visualized by in situ hybridization at 14 hpf (<b>G</b>) and 24 hpf (<b>I</b>), compared with Wt controls at 14 hpf (<b>F</b>) and 24 hpf (<b>H</b>), respectively. Increased expression levels of Cyp26a1 were confirmed by real-time PCR (<b>J</b>).* p &lt; 0.05.</div></div>
