From: Protracted Upregulation of Leptin and IGF1 is Associated with Activation of PI3K/Akt and JAK2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in Mouse Intestine after Ionizing Radiation Exposure. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Summary of radiation-induced persistent alterations of IGF1 and leptin signaling pathways observed in our study. Radiation exposure was associated with decreased IGFBP3, increased IGF1 and IGF1R, and activation of PI3K/Akt pathway via IRS1. Radiation exposure also decreased adiponectin and Adipo-R, increased leptin and Ob-R, and activated JAK2 pathway. Adiponectin antagonizes IGF1 and leptin, and decreased adiponectin and its receptors are expected to further promote IGF1 and leptin signaling through reduced antagonism. There is also existence of crosstalk between JAK2 and PI3K/Akt via IRS1 and combined activation of these two pathways is contributing to intestinal cell proliferation with potential for intestinal disorder and colon cancer.</div></div>
