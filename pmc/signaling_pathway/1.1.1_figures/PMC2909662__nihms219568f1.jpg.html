MyD88-dependant signaling is common to most TLRs including TLRs 1,2,4 (shown) and 5,6,7,8,9,11 (not shown). TRIF-dependant signaling results from TLR4 and TLR3 activation only. Note that TLR3 resides in endosomal vesicles, shown here responding to engulfed foreign RNA. The pentagon shapes denotes proteins that interact through a TIR domain. The TRAM adaptor (lime green) is exclusive to TLR4 and coordinates the TRIF response through TLR4’s TIR domain. TRIF-dependant signaling primarily results in IFN-β production (red adaptors), but the TRIF pathway also induces “late stage” NF-κB activation through RIP 1 (white) and TRAF 6 (seafoam green). The MyD88-dependant cascade initiates “early stage” NF-κB activation through the IKKs (IKKs α,β,λ) and/or the MAPK pathway, leading to proinflammatory cytokine expression and subsequent amplification through additional immune pathways.</div></div>
