Mechanism of AC5-mediated regulation of longevity.

The activation of ERK leads to increased expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), which results in inhibition of apoptosis. On the other hand, the ERK signaling activates the cell survival signaling (ref). Taken together, these mechanisms contribute to increased longevity in AC5KO mice. Western blots demonstrate the changes of key enzymes in the heart by disruption of AC5 [179]. Figures used and modified with permission</div></div>
