Protein degradation within the autolysosome raises the intracellular levels of amino acids, leading to activation of TOR through the RagA/RagC small GTPases and other nutrient signaling pathways. TOR activity is self-limited through an S6K-mediated inhibition of IRS1 (not shown), an essential component in the insulin/PI3K/Akt pathway upstream of Rheb. S6K is also involved in a self-limiting pathway in autophagy induction downstream of TOR, probably through its function in protein synthesis. Inhibition of TOR leads to both activation of Atg1 and inactivation of S6K; both of these kinases play positive roles in starvation-induced autophagy. (b) Feed-forward mechanisms in TOR signaling, indicated by green lines, may lead to amplification and stabilization of initially modest changes in TOR activity. DEPTOR, PRAS40 and Atg1 are each inhibited by TOR mediated phosphorylation and in turn inhibit TOR activity. In yeast, TOR mediates activation of Tap42, which leads to downregulation of the phosphatase Sit4 and decreased activity of the Tap42 inhibitor Tip41, resulting in further activation of Tap42.</div></div>
