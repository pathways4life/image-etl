The Notch signaling pathway was inhibited by administration of a γ-secretase inhibitor [Compound E (CompE)] for 5 days by daily ip injection (10 μmol·kg−1·day−1) of 6- to 8-wk-old C57BL/6 mice. Frozen sections from mouse small intestine with (B and D) and without (A and C) treatment of CompE were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE; A and B) and Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS; C and D), a staining marker of goblet cells.</div></div>
