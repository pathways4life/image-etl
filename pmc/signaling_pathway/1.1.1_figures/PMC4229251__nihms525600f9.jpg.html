Here, activated CNP/cGMP signaling leads to decreased phosphorylation of CRMP2 (p-CRMP2), which activates microtubule assembly and axon branching/growth. The supporting evidence is based on correlative observations from biochemical, cell biological, and pharmacological studies. NOC: nocodazole.B) The proposed molecular pathway connecting the extracellular cue CNP to dynamic microtubule polymerization. Here, CNP binds to its cell surface receptor Npr2, which catalyzes the production of cGMP. cGMP-activated PrkG1 can phosphorylate GSK3 (p-GSK3) and prevent it from phosphorylating CRMP2. Following that in A), decreased CRMP2 phosphorylation (p-CRMP2) then leads to stimulate microtubule polymerization that is needed for axon branching and growth.</div></div>
