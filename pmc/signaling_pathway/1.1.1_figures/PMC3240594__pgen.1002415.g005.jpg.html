(left) In miRNA co-targeting, multiple independently acting miRNAs can target the same pathway to modulate pathway activity (right) In pathway cotargeting, a pathway acts to target multiple independent miRNAs, which exert either similar or distinct downstream effects. B) miRNAs jointly correlated to a common pathway tend to be expressed from the same genomic cluster. In Scenario 1, a miRNA pair regulating a common pathway is associated with the same genomic location. In Scenario 2, that miRNA pair occupies different locations.(bottom graph) miRNAs connected to the same pathway are likely to be transcribed from the same genomic cluster rather than from different genomic clusters. C) miRNAs jointly correlated to a common pathway tend to exhibit significant overlaps in target mRNAs. Scenario 1 – miRNA pairs jointly correlated to the same pathway tend to exert similar downstream effects ie high overlap of target mRNAs (overlap ratio &gt;0.6). Scenario 2 – miRNAs pairs jointly correlated to the same pathway tend to exert distinct effects (overlap ratio &lt;0.4). (bottom graph) miRNAs with significant overlaps of target mRNAs (overlap ratio &gt;0.6) are more likely to be jointly connected to the same pathway. p-values were computed from a chi-square test.</div></div>
