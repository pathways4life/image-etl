From: Changes in the Balance of Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase/Protein Kinase B (Akt) and the Mitogen-activated Protein Kinases (ERK/p38MAPK) Determine a Phenotype of Visceral and Vascular  Smooth Muscle Cells . </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Distinct signaling pathways are directly involved in  the phenotypic determination of visceral and vascular SMCs.  Maintenance of a differentiated phenotype of SMCs depends on  the PI3-K/PKB(Akt) pathway. In contrast, the coordinate activation of the ERK and p38MAPK pathways induces SMC de-differentiation. IGF-I, which is a potent factor for maintaining the  differentiated SMC phenotype, activates the signaling pathway  mediated through PI3-K/PKB(Akt), but not MAPKs. Blocking  the PI3-K/PKB(Akt) pathway with specific inhibitors of PI3-K,  LY249002, or wortmannin, induces SMC de-differentiation. Potent SMC de-differentiation-inducing factors, PDGF-BB, bFGF,  and EGF, all activate the ERK and p38MAPK pathways. bFGF  and EGF do not enhance the PI3-K/PKB(Akt) pathway,  whereas, PDGF-BB does activate it. Thus, PDGF-BB triggers  the dual signaling pathways, PI3-K/PKB(Akt) and two MAPKs.  When the ERK and p38MAPK pathways were simultaneously  blocked by their specific inhibitors, PD98059 and SB203580,  PDGF-BB in turn initiates to induce maintaining SMC differentiation. Therefore, the SMC phenotype would be determined by  the balance between the strengths of the PI3-K/PKB(Akt) pathway and the ERK and p38MAPK pathways.</div></div>
