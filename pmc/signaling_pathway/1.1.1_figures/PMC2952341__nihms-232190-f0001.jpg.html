This liberates the membrane-bound Notch intracellular domain (NICD) to translocate into the nucleus, where NICD forms a transcriptional complex with nuclear factor RBPJ and the co-activator MAML to regulate transcription of downstream genes, such as HES1 and HEY1, the two classic targets of Notch. The non-canonical pathway or RBPJ-independent Notch signaling occurs in Drosophila and mammals. Here, Notch can activate integrin via the membrane associated small GTPase R-Ras independent of binding RBPJ. In addition, NICD can interact with IKKÎ± in the NF-kB pathway or LEF1 in the Wnt pathway.</div></div>
