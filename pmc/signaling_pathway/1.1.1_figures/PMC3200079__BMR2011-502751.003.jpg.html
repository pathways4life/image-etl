Developmental stages are indicated starting with the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), and into the B cell pathway, stages proB, preB, and mature B cells. Normal gene expression along the developmental pathway is indicated with blue bars, and expression dependency between proteins is indicated with arrows. Most common modified forms of these receptors, signaling proteins, and transcription factors associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are also indicated.</div></div>
