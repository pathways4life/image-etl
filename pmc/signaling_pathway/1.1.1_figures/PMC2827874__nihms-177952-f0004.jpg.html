From: From fate to function: the Drosophila trachea and salivary gland as models for tubulogenesis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Several signaling pathways have been implicated in tracheal migration, including endothelial growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Dpp, and Wg. EGF signaling is localized by the expression of rho, which encodes a protease essential for the processing of the EGF ligand. EGF signaling is required for the complete internalization of the tracheal primordia. FGF signaling is limited by the expression of the ligand Bnl in the tissues toward which the tracheal branches migrate. FGF signaling is required for all migration. Dpp signaling is limited by the expression of the ligand Dpp in cells dorsal and ventral to the trachea. Dpp signaling is required for migration of the dorsal branch, lateral trunk, and ganglionic branch. Wg signaling is limited by the localization of the Wg signal in ectodermal cells near the tracheal primordia. Wg signaling is required to maintain salm expression in the dorsal trunk (DT) and to prevent the DT from migrating with the visceral branch. Green indicates the spatial position of the signal relative to the trachea. Blue indicates the tracheal primordia in the drawing along the top. Blue filled circles indicate that the cells have migrated to their correct positions in wild type and in the various signaling pathway mutants. White circles indicate that cells are missing in particular branches in the mutants.</div></div>
