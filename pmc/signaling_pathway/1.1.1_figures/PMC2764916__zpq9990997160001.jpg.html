(A) Core JAK-STAT pathway factors identified in Drosophila and their putative roles in the cascade. (B) Evolutionary conservation of the JAK-STAT immune signaling in insects and humans. Insect orthologs are indicated with solid black circles at the branch node. Genes that are transcriptionally regulated by the insect STAT are indicated with a star. The pathway core intracellular machinery is highly conserved in human and insects. The upstream ligands and effectors are less conserved, which may suggest a hostâ€“pathogen-specific response. Accession numbers are presented in Fig. S1.</div></div>
