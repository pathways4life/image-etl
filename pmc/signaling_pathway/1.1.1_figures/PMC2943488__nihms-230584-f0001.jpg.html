Inflammatory cytokines bind to their cognate receptors and activate shared downstream phosphoprotein signaling pathways regulating cell death. Hepatotoxic drugs (hepatotoxicants) lead to various cellular stresses (e.g. ROS accumulation) that are integrated into stress-related phosphoprotein signaling (e.g. JNK pathway) and mitochondrial control of apoptosis. Phosphoproteins and cell death phenotypes experimentally assayed in this study are indicated.</div></div>
