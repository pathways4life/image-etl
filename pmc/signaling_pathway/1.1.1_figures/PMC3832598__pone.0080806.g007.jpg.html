From: CD43 Promotes Cells Transformation by Preventing Merlin-Mediated Contact Inhibition of Growth. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In epithelial cells, upon interaction with putative ligand(s) present on the cell surface of neighboring cells or in the extracellular matrix, CD43 activates the PI3K/AKT pathway that results in the inhibition of the Hippo pathway by a mechanism involving Merlin phosphorylation and degradation, thus favoring cell survival and proliferation. Depending of the cellular context, signaling from intracellular CD43 located either on membrane vesicles or the nuclear membrane may also contribute to cellular transformation. Nonetheless, this might not be sufficient to overcome the anti-proliferative and death effects resulting from the activation of the ARF-p53 pathway also induced by CD43 [24]. However, in transformed cells with an impaired p53 pathway resulting from oncogenic signals like those provided by the E6 oncoprotein from HPV16, CD43 signaling promotes cells proliferation and tumor formation. </div></div>
