The canonical pathway is critical for the activation of innate immunity and inflammation (left). It is activated by TNFα, IL-1, and lipopolysaccharide. Activation of this pathway depends on the IKKα/IKKβ/IKKγ complex, which phosphorylates IκB proteins to trigger their degradation through β-TrCP ubiquitin proteasome. The noncanonical pathway is crucial for the activation of adaptive immunity (right). It is activated by lipopolysaccharide, B cell – activating factor of the TNF family, and latent membrane protein 1. Activation of this pathway depends on IKKα homodimers which phosphorylate p100 to induce p100/RELB heterodimers processing intop52/RELB heterodimers.</div></div>
