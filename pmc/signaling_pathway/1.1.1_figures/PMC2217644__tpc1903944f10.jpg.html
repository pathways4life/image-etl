From: Plastid Signals Remodel Light <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Networks and Are Essential for Efficient Chloroplast Biogenesis in Arabidopsis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model for PhANG Regulation by a Network of Plastid and Light Signaling Pathways.The current model for the GUN1-dependent plastid-to-nucleus signaling pathway was adapted from Koussevitzky et al. (2007). In this model, a second messenger (indicated with Y) that requires GUN1 for either its production or transduction (dotted arrows) triggers a plastid-to-nucleus signaling pathway that represses PhANGs. A plastid signal(s) that is independent of GUN1 (indicated with X) represses both Lhcb and Rbcs in the dark (data not shown) and also converts cry1 and one or more photoreceptors that perceive red light into negative regulators of Lhcb and Rbcs. cry1 becomes a negative regulator of Lhcb when X converts HY5 from a positive to a negative regulator of Lhcb. Under these same conditions, Rbcs is induced by cry1 and simultaneously repressed by a combination of blue and red light.</div></div>
