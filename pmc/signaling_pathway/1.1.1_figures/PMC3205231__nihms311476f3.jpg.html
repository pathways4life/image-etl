The activity of PIFs could be enhanced by the COP1/DET1 through HFR1 repression; the protein stability of at least PIF3 is promoted by COP1 through an unknown mechanism. The recently identified HMR acts early in the pathways and is involved in the degradation of PIFs and phyA as well as the inhibition of DET1.</div></div>
