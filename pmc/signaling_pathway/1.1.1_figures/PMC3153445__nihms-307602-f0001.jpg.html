In blue the canonical pathway in which cAMP activates PKA, phosphorylating the L-type Ca++ channel (LTCC) and RyR2, is shown to activate Ca++/CaM and CaMKII. The pathway shown in orange utilizes the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) rather than PKA, activating CaMKII through the small GTP’ase Rap, phospholipase C epsilon (PLCε), and protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε). The purple pathway utilizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling to effect CaMKII activation at known sites; the green pathway utilizes NO synthase (NOS) signaling to effect CaMKII activation through more hypothetical mechanisms.</div></div>
