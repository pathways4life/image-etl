Left panel represents the activity of the pathway in the normal intestinal epithelial cells. Right panel shows three models of hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway in the colorectal cancer cells caused by EGFR copy number increased, PI3K and PTEN mutations, respectively. Red star – activation; red crossed lines – inactivation; dashed lines – irrelevant signal.</div></div>
