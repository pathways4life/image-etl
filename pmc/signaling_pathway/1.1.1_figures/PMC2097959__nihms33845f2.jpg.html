This process triggers downstream signaling through four major cytoplasmic pathways depicted schematically. Nuclear influx of EGFR initiates interaction with transcription factors and proteins participating in DNA double-strand break repair. Endosomal degradation or recycling regulates EGFR signaling. A mitochondrial pathway has recently been described and its functions is under investigation.</div></div>
