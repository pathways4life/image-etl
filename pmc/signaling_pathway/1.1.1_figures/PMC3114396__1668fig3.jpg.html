A: Shh-LIGHT2 cells were treated with 200 nmol/L SAG and/or 25 ng/µL IFN-γ in the absence or presence of JakInh. Simultaneous treatment of cells with SAG and JakInh resulted in an additional increase in relative Gli1 luciferase activity compared with SAG only–treated cells. B–D: We also tested whether effects of IFN-γ on Gli1 expression could persist in MEFs from Ifngr1−/− and Stat1−/− mice. The inhibitory effect of IFN-γ on Shh signaling was cancelled in Ifngr1−/− and Stat1−/− MEFs. These experiments demonstrate that IFN-γ acts by means of the Jak-Stat pathway to abrogate the effects of Shh signaling.
