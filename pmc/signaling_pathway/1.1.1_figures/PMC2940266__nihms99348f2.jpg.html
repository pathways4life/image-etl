These pathways include the Wnt signaling pathway, the energy signaling pathway, as well as p53 signaling. Through inhibiting GSK3β, activation of AKT leads to the stabilization of β-catenin, a critical factor in Wnt signaling. PI3K/AKT signal also cross talks with energy signaling pathway at TSC. Whereas AKT phophorylates and inhibit TSC, AMPK, a kinase activated in response to an increase in AMP:ATP ratio phosporylates and activates TSC. In addition to its function primarily through AKT in the cytoplasm, nuclear PTEN may have its unique functions. These include direct association with p53, CENP and regulation of rad 51 to control the later stages of the cell cycle and DNA repair mechanisms.</div></div>
