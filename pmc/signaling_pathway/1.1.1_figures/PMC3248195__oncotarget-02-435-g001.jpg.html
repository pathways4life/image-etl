Schematic diagram of the PI3K <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> and its activation in human breast cancer.  From: Elevated PI3K <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> drives multiple Breast Cancer subtypes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The pathway can be activated at multiple levels including at the level of InsR/Igf-1R, c-MET or HEH2/HER3 receptors, at the level of adaptor proteins, PI3K regulatory or catalytic subunits, at the level of downstream Akt kinases or through deletion/inactivation of inhibitors of the pathway. Note, for simplicity, alternative receptor-activated signaling pathways as well as the full spectrum of PIP3 targets and Akt and TORC targets are not shown.</div></div>
