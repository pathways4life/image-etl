From: Insulin/IGF-I and Related <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways Regulate Aging in Nondividing Cells: from Yeast to the Mammalian Brain. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Interactions between insulin/IGF-I, TOR, and SIRT1 pathways in mammals. Nutrients, mainly amino acids, promote the activity of the TOR kinase. TOR, in its turn, activates S6K, a crucial AGC kinase involved cell growth, which can inhibit PI3K activation. Activated PKB activates TOR signaling via inhibition of TSC-1 and -2. The SIRT1 interactions represented in the figure have been observed in neurons[163,172]. SIRT1 promotes activation of the IRS-2 and Ras/ERK1/2 pathway, suggesting that SIRT1 may strengthen IGF-I signaling, in part, by deacetylating IRS-2. Inhibition of SIRT1 reverts the described mechanisms and enhances resistance to oxidative stress.</div></div>
