(B) Box plot representing expression value of Notch receptors NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 in the same samples. Expression is normalized to GAPDH expression. (C) Heat map showing relative expression levels of Notch signaling pathway target genes in Lin−CD34+CD38− and Lin−CD34+CD38+ populations from 12 AML patients compared with normal Lin−CD34+CD38− BM cells. (D) qRT-PCR analysis for HES1 gene in CD34+ cord blood stem cells and four AML patient samples (left) and ChIP of H3K27me3 on the promoter of the same samples (right). (E) qRT-PCR analysis for NRARP gene in CD34+ cord blood stem cells and four AML patient samples (left) and ChIP of H3K27me3 on the promoter of the same samples (right). (F) qRT-PCR analysis for HES1 gene in THP1 and DND41 cell lines (left) and ChIP of H3K27me3 on the promoter of HES1 gene in THP1 and DND41 cell lines (right).
