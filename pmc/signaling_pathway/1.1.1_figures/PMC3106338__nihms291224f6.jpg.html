Pathway analysis was performed using the Ingenuity software as described in the methods. Genes that are upregulated are shown in dark gray and genes that are downregulated are shown in light gray. Significant upregulation of interferon signaling pathway in TG mice is shown. In addition the antigen presentation, pattern recognition receptor, complement, and Granzyme B pathways are upregulated in TG mice. In contrast the fatty acid metabolism and arachidonic acid metabolism pathways are significantly downregulated. <b>(B)</b> IPA analysis of mRNA expression data from human thyrocytes exposed to IFNα for 24 hrs. As expected the interferon signaling pathway is upregulated in cells exposed to IFNα. In addition, antigen presentation, complement, and pattern recognition receptor pathways are upregulated similar to the TG thyroids. Additional upregulated pathways include retinoic acid receptor signaling and retinoic acid mediated apoptosis pathways, while the cell cycle pathway is downregulated.</div></div>
