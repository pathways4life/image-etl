Then, we integrated the protein-protein interactions affecting proteins in the manually curated core of SignaLink 2. With this step we also imported first neighbor proteins of the pathway member and pathway regulator proteins. Then, we integrated the transcription factors (TF) that regulate all these proteins. Finally, we integrated miRNAs and their interactions with the mRNAs of all the already inserted proteins. We also added the TFs of the imported miRNAs.</div></div>
