Radiation induced SMAD7, a bottleneck in radiotherapy.  From: Role of Radiation-induced TGF-beta <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Cancer Therapy. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">As a negative feedback mechanism, radiation-induced TGF-β, elevates the expression of SMAD7, which blocks the activity of this pathway. TIEG2 (also known as KLF11) is a tumor suppressor gene that causes repression of SMAD7 expression and can be a useful target for adjuvant radiotherapy to harness the negative growth effects of TGF-β signaling pathway. Thus, over expression of TIEG2 will drive the TGF-β pathway towards the growth suppressive functions and enhance the radiation response.</div></div>
