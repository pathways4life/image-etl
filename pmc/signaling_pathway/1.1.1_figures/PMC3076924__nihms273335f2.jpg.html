From: Targeting ligand-operated chaperone sigma-1 receptors in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Signaling pathways explored in the last 5 years are summarized. Signaling cascades of the Sig-1R fall into three categories: 1) the rapid action involving physical protein-protein interaction or signaling molecules (e.g., chaperone activation, Ca2+ signaling, regulation of kinase activity or protein phosphorylation), 2) transcriptional regulation of gene expression downstream of the Sig-1R signaling (e.g., ROS-induced NFκB activation, CREB-induced transcription), 3) stress- or ligand-induced upregulation of Sig-1Rs. Overexpression or knockdown studies highlighted that the Sig-1R protein level per se, even in the absence of exogenous ligands, affects several cell death/survival signalings. It is not fully clarified how Sig-1Rs translocate from ER to plasmalemmal ER subdomains or to plasma membrane to physically associate with plasma membrane proteins such as ion channels and dopamine D1 receptors (see text “The unique subcellular localization of Sig-1Rs”). Note: data summarized are obtained from various cell types and brain regions. They are depicted together for simplicity. (+), pathways/molecules potentiated by Sig-1R expression or Sig-1R activation by agonists; (−), pathways/molecules inhibited by Sig-1R expression or Sig-1R activation by agonists. (--&gt;), activatory pathway; (--I) inhibitory pathway.</div></div>
