From: An integrative ChIP-chip and gene expression profiling to model SMAD regulatory modules. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of SMAD targets: (A)</b> A graphical representation of overlapping signaling pathways detected in differentially expressed genes and SMAD-target genes. Wnt/Î²-catenin was found to be significant. (<b>B</b>) The result of Ingenuity analyses of Affymerix gene expression and SMAD-predicted datasets. There are total nine significant signaling pathways (shown in bar graphs) for gene expression data, and six significant signaling pathways for SMAD-predicted molecules (shown by asterisks). There is a major functional overlap (about 70% or 6/9) between gene expression and SMAD-predicted data. Note that the p values were calculated by Ingenuity algorithm  per each pathway within Affymerix gene expression dataset and minus log p values are shown. The minus log p values for SMAD-predicted molecules are not shown.</div></div>
