Assessment of the biological relevance of the predicted genetic interaction network with <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> annotations..  From: Searching for <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Balance through the Identification of Genetic Interactors of the Rab Guanine-Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor gdi-1. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Here we show scenarios where a pair of genes annotated to the same pathway (A) is directly connected or (B) shares ≥1 neighbor in a genetic interaction network, where the gene pair of interest is highlighted with thick grey rings. In (A), the genes exhibit a within-pathway genetic interaction based on the given set of pathway annotations. In (B), the genes belonging to the same pathway (e.g. pathway A) both interact with a gene that may either be an unknown member of the same pathway (within pathway interaction), or may belong to a different pathway (e.g. pathway B, between-pathway interactions). Below, the frequencies at which each scenario occurs in the predicted network and in randomized networks are shown with respect to all pathways and to signaling pathways only (see Methods). The “all pathways” and signaling pathway annotations were derived from human and C. elegans experimental data respectively. For each set of pathway annotations, the median, first and third quartile frequencies of each scenario were computed across N = 100K randomized networks; the bar length depicts the median and the error bars depict the first and third quartiles. Both scenarios occur more frequently than what is expected by chance, for both sets of pathway annotations.</div></div>
