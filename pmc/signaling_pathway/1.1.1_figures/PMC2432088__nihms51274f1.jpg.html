The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is referred to as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway since it can regulate β-catenin. All Wnt signaling pathways are initiated by interaction of Wnt proteins with Frizzled (FZD) receptors. The Wnt signaling pathway will only be activated if the binding of the Wnt protein to the FZD receptor takes place in the presence of the co-receptor LRP-5/6 resulting in the formation of a Wnt-FZD-LRP-5/6 tri-molecular complex. Once Wnt protein binds to the FZD receptor and the co-receptor LRP-5/6, this is followed by recruitment of Dishevelled (DVL). DVL is phosphorylated by casein kinase Iε to form a complex with Frat1 and inhibit glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3β) activity. The non-canonical or atypical Wnt signaling pathway has two intracellular signaling cascades that consist of the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway and the Wnt/PCP pathway. In the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, Wnt protein binds to FZD receptors on the cell surface resulting in several cellular processes that involve stimulation of heterotrimeric G proteins, increased intracellular Ca2+ release, decreased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, and activation of the two kinases Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) or calcineurin (CaCN) and protein kinase C (PKC). Activation of these pathways can stimulate several transcription factors. In the Wnt/PCP pathway, Wnt proteins bind to FZD receptors on the cell surface followed by activating Rho/Rac small GTPase and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to assist with cytoskeletal organization and gene expression.</div></div>
