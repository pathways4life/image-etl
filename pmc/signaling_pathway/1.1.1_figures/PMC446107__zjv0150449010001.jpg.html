TLR2 (in combination with TLR1 or TLR6) and TLR4 utilize MyD88 and TIRAP/MAL as primary adaptors to activate NF-ÎºB and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Also, TLR4 uses TRIF and the TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) to activate IRF3 and the IFN pathway. TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 typically localize to endocytic compartments, where they detect a variety of nucleic acids and activate the IFN pathway. TLR3 utilizes TRIF, but not TRAM, to activate IRF3. TLRs 7, 8, and 9 trigger inflammatory cytokine secretion and the IFN pathway through MyD88. Other than MyD88, the signaling intermediates utilized by TLRs 7, 8, and 9 to activate IFN responses remain undefined.</div></div>
