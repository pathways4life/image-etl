The activity of the Wnt signaling pathway increases as worms age, leading to increased expression of elt-5 GATA transcription factor. This GATA transcription factor represses the expression of elt-3 in old worms. Changes in the elt-3 GATA transcription factor activate a cascade of downstream effects, which causes aging. The elt-3/elt-5 GATA transcriptional circuit could be one of a number of genetic programs that are under control of the Wnt signaling pathway during aging. In addition to developmental programs for aging, Wnt signaling might regulate genes responsible for cellular stress response, but not for oxidative damage.</div></div>
