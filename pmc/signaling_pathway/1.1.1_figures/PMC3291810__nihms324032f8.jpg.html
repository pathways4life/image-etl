PAK1 simultaneously activates two distinct <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways to promote transformation.  From: PAK1 is a breast cancer oncogene that coordinately activates MAPK and MET <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The model depicts PAK1 mechanism of action to activate the RAS-MAPK (Orange) pathway through direct activation of RAF1 and MEK1. The second arm (Purple) shows that PAK1 and Merlin are in an inhibitory loop, which can be pushed by PAK1 amplification and overexpression to inhibit Merlin that leads to MET signaling activation through GAB1.</div></div>
