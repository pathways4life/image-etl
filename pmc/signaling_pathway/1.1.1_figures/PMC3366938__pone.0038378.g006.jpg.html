Luciferase activity was then assayed (n = 4). *: p&lt;0.05 as compared with HGF-treated group. (C) Schematic diagram of the signaling pathways involved in HGF-induced OPN expression in osteoblasts. HGF increases OPN expression by binding to the c-Met receptor and activating PI3K, Akt, and c-Src, which enhances binding of c-Jun to the AP-1 site. This results in the transactivation of OPN expression.</div></div>
