Additional LMP1 sequences are not required for masking TRADD's apoptotic activity. TRADD mediates the recruitment of IKKβ to the LMP1 signaling complex through a yet unidentified factor. Activation of IKKβ requires a parallel pathway that is dependent on TRAF6. TRAF6 activation of IKKβ most likely involves TAK1 and TAB1 (not depicted). The JNK pathway is TRADD-independent and works through TRAF6 and, probably, BS69. To keep this model concise, only key molecules of CTAR2 signaling are shown.
