When wnt binds to the LRP-frizzled receptor in the surface of the cell,β-catenin is stabilized promoting expression of wnt target genes and proliferation. Subtle disequilibrium in any step of the pathway in a manner that determines activation of the pathway, such as increased expression or polimorphisms that induce activation of wnt or β-catenin would favor cancer development, preventing neurodegeneration. On the contrary, conditions that induce inactivation of the pathway would favor the development of Alzheimer’s disease or other degenerative disorder, and as a consequence protect from cancer development.</div></div>
