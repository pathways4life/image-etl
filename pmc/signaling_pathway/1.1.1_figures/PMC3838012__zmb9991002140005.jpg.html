(A to C) AKO and WT DEpSCs were induced as described in the legend to Fig. 4 and analyzed by Western blotting of nuclear proteins (A), qRT-PCR (B), or IF (C) to examine the expression of genes related to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway or the TGF-β pathway (n = 3 in each assay) (n.s., not significant; ∗, P &lt; 0.05). (D) P7 WT and AKO teeth were examined with double IF for β-catenin and Krt14.</div></div>
