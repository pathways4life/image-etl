Profile-1 genes were used for IPA. The A) Cdc42 and B) p38 MAPK signaling pathways identified for profile-1 genes are shown. The shaded symbols represent gene hits in the pathway and clear symbols representing other known genes in the signaling pathway (squares = cytokines, oval shape = transcription factors and triangle shape = kinases).</div></div>
