From: Agonist-induced Localization of Gq-coupled Receptors and G Protein-gated Inwardly Rectifying K+ (GIRK) Channels to Caveolae Determines Receptor Specificity of Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Bisphosphate <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Schematic diagram of signaling microdomain for specific PIP2 signal.</b> Stimulation of M2AChR/GIRK pathway and ETAR induce the recruitments of each component to Cav-3, which allow ETAR to interact with GIRK channels (upper). In contrast, B2R are dissociated from Cav-3 during B2R stimulation. By losing scaffolding network, they cannot interact with GIRK channel complexes any more (lower).</div></div>
