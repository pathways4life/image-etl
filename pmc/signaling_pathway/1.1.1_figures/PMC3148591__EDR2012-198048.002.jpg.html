From: Diabetic Inhibition of Preconditioning- and Postconditioning-Mediated Myocardial Protection against Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Major signaling pathways of IPC- and Ipost-mediated protection against cardiac cell death. Myocardial protection of IPC and Ipost were proposed to be mediated by stimulation of the prosurvival signaling pathway—PI3K/Akt pathway to inhibit the GSK-3β activation either via PI3K pathway or JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Diabetes (DM) can inhibit the activation of STAT3 or Akt to consequently activate GSK-3β that in turn induces mitochondrial cell death that is the critical cellular event for ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial infarction.</div></div>
