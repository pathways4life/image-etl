(C and D) puc-lacZ, a reporter for JNK signaling, is increased in dpp-Gal4; UAS-Rho1+–expressing cells. (E and F) Mmp1, an additional downstream target of JNK signaling, is also up-regulated in cells expressing the Rho1 transgene (compare E with F). (G and H) Apoptosis, caused by expression of dpp-Gal4; UAS-Rho1+ (dpp&gt;Rho1; G) is increased by reducing the dosage of puc (H) and thereby increasing JNK signaling. (I–K) Conversely, apoptosis induced by dpp&gt;Rho1+ is suppressed by blocking JNK signaling at the level of Bsk (UAS-bskDN [I] or UAS-puc [J]), the sole Jun kinase, or Hep (UAS-hepRNAi; K), a JNK kinase. (L) Knockdown of both Slpr and Tak1, two JNKKKs, together in dpp&gt;Rho1+-expressing cells suppresses apoptosis to a large extent. For all genotypes, examples shown are representative of ≥20 imaginal discs examined. Bar, 25 µm.</div></div>
