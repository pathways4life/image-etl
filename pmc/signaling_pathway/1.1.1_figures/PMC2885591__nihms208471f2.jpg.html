The diagram summarizes the lifespan data for genes in the TOR signaling pathway or those that demonstrate a genetic interaction with mutants in the TOR pathway. The shaded area refers to components of the TOR pathway that show conserved effects on lifespan extension in different species. See main text for details.</div></div>
