From: Rho Kinase-Dependent Sox9 Activation in Chondrocytes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The established pathway of Rho signaling is through ROCK and LIM Kinase to inactivate cofilin, an actin-severing protein. This results in an overall increase in F-actin, which through a series of unknown events leads to changes in matrix gene expression. Based on the observations in this manuscript we present a revised model in which ROCK directly phosphorylates Sox9Ser181, causing increased nuclear localization and enhanced matrix gene expression. Thus, while actin remodeling also occurs upon stimulation of the revised pathway, this is a parallel event to the direct activation of Sox9 by ROCK.</div></div>
