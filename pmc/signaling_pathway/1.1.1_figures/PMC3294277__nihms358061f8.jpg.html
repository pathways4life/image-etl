Phosphatases play a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating and limiting phosphorylation and downstream signaling. In particular, the insulin receptor and its signaling pathway are tightly regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. Activation of the insulin receptor leads to its phosphorylation and triggers the phosphorylation of the IRS protein family, resulting in downstream activation of kinases and modulation of metabolic enzymes and pathways. PTP1B exerts a tight control of these phosphorylation events. Adduction of PTP1B by electrophiles at the catalytic cysteine results in catalytic inhibition, prolonging the effects and intensity of regulated pathways, thus impacting glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Electrophiles modulate this pathway both directly (through covalent binding to PTP1B) and indirectly (through activation of the general metabolic regulator PPARÎ³).</div></div>
