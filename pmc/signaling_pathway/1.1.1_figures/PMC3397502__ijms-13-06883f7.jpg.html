Based on the results obtained by Aguilera and co-workers, fragment C can induce cerebellar granular cell survival under stress conditions, activating signaling pathways associated with Trk receptors that include the activation of PLC, the Ras/MAPK pathway and the PI3 pathway, leading to the survival of the cell [88,89]. Another possible retrograde pathway of fragment C of tetanus toxin is shared by p75NTR, TrkB and BDNF, which is strongly dependent on the activities of the small GTPases Rab5 and Rab7 [56].</div></div>
