A model for Tao-1â€™s function in the HSW <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>.  From: Tao-1 Phosphorylates Hippo/MST kinases to Regulate the Hippo-Salvador-Warts Tumor Suppressor <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Tao-1 directly phosphorylates Hpo at T195 in the kinase activation loop, leading to the activation of Wts and inhibition of Yki, which remains cytoplasmic when phosphorylated. In the absence of HSW pathway activity, Yki translocates to the nucleus to promote transcription of target genes that promote growth and inhibit cell death. Genetic and biochemical experiments position Tao-1 upstream of Hpo and suggest that Mer and Ex function through Tao-1 to activate HSW signaling. Kibra, Mer and Ex can form a protein complex and promote HSW activation, but it remains unclear if Kibra functions upstream or in parallel to Tao-1.</div></div>
