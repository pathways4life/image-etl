Type I strains use ROP16 to phosphorylate and activate STAT3 and STAT6 leading to activation of an AAM-type gene expression profile (left). By contrast, the Type II ROP16 has a negligible effect on STAT3 and STAT6. Instead, GRA15 activates NF-κB to drive a CAM-type response, while the Type I GRA15 has a negligible effect on NF-κB activation in Type I strains where ROP16 activates STAT3 and STAT6. The parasite entry pathway and structure modified from Boothroyd and Dubremetz (2008).</div></div>
