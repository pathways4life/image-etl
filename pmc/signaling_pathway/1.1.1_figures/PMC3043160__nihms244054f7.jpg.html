Hamartin and tuberin form a complex and localize in the basal body. Tuberin is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) which controls the activity of Rheb. Tuberin inactivates Rheb, thereby inhibiting the mTOR pathway. In polycystic kidneys, however, tuberin is no longer protected in this complex and is phosphorylated by Akt, RSK (via ERK). As a result, tubulin is unable to form a heteradimer with hamartin. Hence, tuberin is no longer able inhibit Rheb, and the mTOR pathway is activated.</div></div>
