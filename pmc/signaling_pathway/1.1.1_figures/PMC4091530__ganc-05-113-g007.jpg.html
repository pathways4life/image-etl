From: Amphiregulin and PTEN evoke a multimodal mechanism of acquired resistance to PI3K inhibition. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) SW48 cells are initially sensitive to GDC-0941. GDC-0941 resistance develops with autocrine (AREG/EGFR) signaling and activation of the MAPK pathway. Cells eventually lose PTEN protein as resistance develops. (B) Resistant cells must be maintained on GDC-0941 to prevent signaling flare. In the absence of GDC-0941, resistant cells signal strongly through the PI3K pathway.</div></div>
