A simplified version of the IGF-1 signaling pathway is presented at the left. P53, shown to the right of the IGF-1 signaling pathway, is activated by DNA damage and can induce cell cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis. In addition, four entry points of p53 into the IGF-1 signaling pathway are indicated. From top to bottom: (1) p53 transcriptionally activates the IGF-BP3 gene, whose product binds to IGF-1 and inhibits its function; (2) p53 transcriptionally downregulates the IGF-1 receptor; (3) p53 transcriptionally inhibits the p110 subunit of the PI3K subunit; and (4) p53 transcriptionally activates the pTEN gene, which encodes a phosphatase that dephosphorylates PIP3 to downregulate IGF-1 signaling. The end result of suppression of IGF-1 signaling is decreased phoshorylation of Forkhead (FOXO) transcription factors by AKT and increased activity of Forkhead in transcriptionally activating anti-oxidant and DNA repair genes.</div></div>
