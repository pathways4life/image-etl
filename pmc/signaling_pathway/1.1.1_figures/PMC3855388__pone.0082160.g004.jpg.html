From: CyTargetLinker: A Cytoscape App to Integrate Regulatory Interactions in Network Analysis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The ErbB signaling pathway (http://wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP673) from WikiPathways was extended with TFs, miRNAs and drugs regulating the elements in the pathway. The nodes from the original pathway are coloured in grey, TFs in green, miRNAs in yellow and drugs in purple. 258 TF-gene interactions from ENCODE, 162 miRNA-target interactions from the two validated miRNA-target RegINs (miRTarBase and miRecords) and 138 drug-target interactions from DrugBank were added to the network. The edges are coloured based on the RegIN source, purple and orange for ENCODE (proximal and distal), blue and red for miRTarBase and miRecords, and green for DrugBank.</div></div>
