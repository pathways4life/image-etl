Model of Shp2 action in FcεRΙ <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>..  From: Shp2 Activates Fyn and Ras to Regulate RBL-2H3 Mast Cell Activation following Fc?RI Aggregation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Upon FcεRΙ stimulation, Fyn kinase and Ras become activated in a Shp2-dependent manner. Activated Fyn transmits positive signals to PI3K, leading to PI3K activation that accounts for calcium mobilization as well as for Akt phosphoryaltion. MAPKs also become phosphorylated following Ras and Fyn activation that are responsible for production of most cytokines. Paxillin is phosphoryated indirectly by Shp2 upon FcεRΙ stimulation. The direct substrates of Shp2 in FcεRΙ signaling remain to be defined. Another acknowledged signaling pathway Lyn/Syk/LAT is also shown.</div></div>
