(A) Pathway signatures generated on DC-ATLAS. (B) Insert of the pathway signature generated using immune-related public pathway available from KEGG and Reactome. The detail highlights the available pathway involved in the initial recognition of an antigen, in particular the TLR signalings. The complete clustering is available as Figure S3. Colored spots indicate significant (pâ‰¤0.05) up- (red) or down- (green) regulation. The colors of the dendrogram indicate the percentages of the tree support (significance), from 50% (pink) to 100% (black).</div></div>
