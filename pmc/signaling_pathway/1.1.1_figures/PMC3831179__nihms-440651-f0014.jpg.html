Out of these 371 interactors, only 103, 46, 32, 15 or 10 interactors were mentioned in at least two, three, four or all five databases, respectively. For investigators who are interested in only ‘High-Confidence’ datasets (Figure 10), the 10 interactors identified in all five databases mentioned in this example, would be of particular interest.</div></div>
