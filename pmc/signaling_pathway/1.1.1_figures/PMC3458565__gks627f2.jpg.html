From: Involvement of microRNA families in cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Involvement of miRs in signaling pathways. In the heatmap, we counted the number of cancer genes in a signaling pathway that were targeted by a given family of miRs. Ward clustering such a matrix, we found a large cluster of families that strongly interacted with cancer genes in signaling pathways and significantly pooled a large fraction of cancer miR families. Cancer miRs collected from the literature were indicated in red in their corresponding families.</div></div>
