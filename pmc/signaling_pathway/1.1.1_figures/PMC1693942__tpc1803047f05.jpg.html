From: The Exoribonuclease XRN4 Is a Component of the Ethylene Response <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in Arabidopsis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Representation of the Ethylene Signaling Cascade Including XRN4/EIN5.Ethylene is perceived by the ETHYLENE RESPONSE (ETR/ERS) receptors located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Binding of ethylene to the receptors results in the inactivation of both the receptors and CTR1, thereby causing the derepression of positive regulatory factors, such as EIN2 (data not shown) and XRN4/EIN5. How CTR1 regulates EIN2 and XRN4/EIN5 and the relationship of EIN2 with XRN4/EIN5 in the ethylene signaling cascade are unknown. Strikingly, our model proposes the existence of two degradation pathways in ethylene signaling: one RNA decay pathway into the cytosol that indirectly controls the steady state levels of EBF1/2 mRNAs, which are components of a protein degradation pathway that controls EIN3 stability in the nucleus.</div></div>
