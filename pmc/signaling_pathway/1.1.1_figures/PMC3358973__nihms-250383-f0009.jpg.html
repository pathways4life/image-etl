E/sox2:EGFP+ cells exhibit differential expression of <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> specific transcripts.  From: Prospective identification, isolation, and profiling of a telomerase expressing subpopulation of human neural stem cells, using sox2 enhancer-directed FACS. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>A</b>, Parametric gene set enrichment analysis of KEGG signaling pathways was performed on the profiles of E/sox2:EGFP-sorted (E/sox2:EGFP+), depleted (E/sox2:EGFP−) and unsorted VZ/SVZ dissociates (n=4 each). Using a linear modeling approach, significant KEGG pathways were identified between E/sox2:EGFP+ and E/sox2:EGFP− cells at 5% FDR. The heat map visualization shows relative enrichment within each pathway; red indicates over expression and blue lower expression relative to the mean of E/sox2:EGFP− profiles.<b>B</b>, The MAP kinase signaling pathway was significantly depleted according to KEGG pathway analysis. The heat map shows expression of those MAPK pathway genes whose expression differed significantly between E/sox2:EGFP+ and E/sox2:EGFP− cells (&gt;3 fold change, 5% FDR). Furthermore, activators of the MAPK pathways were identified as significantly enriched in E/sox2:EGFP+ following GO-based GSEA.<b>C</b>, The wnt signaling pathway was significantly over expressed in E/sox2:EGFP+ cells. As in <b>B</b>, the heat map shows only significant differentially expressed genes. GO-GSEA further confirmed the over-representation of wnt genes in E/sox2:EGFP+ cells (q&lt;0.05). The color key indicates relative expression on a log2 scale, with red indicating high expression, and green low expression values.</div></div>
