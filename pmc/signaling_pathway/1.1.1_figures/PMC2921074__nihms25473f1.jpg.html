Efferent vagus nerve cholinergic signaling inhibits TNF and other pro-inflammatory cytokine levels through α7nAChR-mediated mechanisms. Experimental evidence indicates that activation of α7nAChR on immune cells by nicotine can prevent NF-κB nuclear translocation. α7nAChR-mediated activation of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway has also been demonstrated in response to nicotine. These signaling pathways play a central role in transmitting vagal or nicotine-induced cholinergic anti-inflammatory signaling leading to inhibition of immune cell activation and suppression of TNF, HMGB1, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and IL-6 synthesis. Brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) signaling mechanisms also modulate vagal immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory output (See text for details).</div></div>
