Subsequent binding of VEGF to its receptor on either CRC cells (autocrine pathway) or tumor-associated endothelial cells (paracrine pathway) leads to activation of VEGFR and its downstream signaling pathways. Receptor tyrosine kinases like VEGFR are able to activate and/or stabilize HIF and VEGF, thereby promoting a positive feed-back loop.</div></div>
