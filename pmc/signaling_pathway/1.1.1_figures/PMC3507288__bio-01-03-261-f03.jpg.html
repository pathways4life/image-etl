Bars represent the relative fold-change in mRNA levels as detected by RT-qPCR when compared to expression in wild-type animals, error bars represent standard error of the mean. Fold expression range considered to be the same as wild-type expression is indicated by light gray shading, centered around the value of 1.0. P values are indicated to the right of each bar. <b>(B)</b> Components of the LIN-3/LET-23 activated IP3 signaling transduction pathway are transcriptionally regulated by HLH-29.</div></div>
