Pathways with membrane component were mostly associated to chemical hits whereas pathways with downstream signalling components were mostly associated to toxicity. This figure represents three possible links between pathways associated to chemical hits (Wnt Signaling Pathway, Long-Term Depression and ErbB Signaling Pathway) and toxicity (Focal Adhesion, ALS and Pancreatic Cancer) through shared genes between the pathways. Although each link presents a mechanism of action these were only implied by the pathway associated to toxicity. Genes found to be up or down regulated have been marked with a red or a blue arrow respectively.</div></div>
