(a) The expression of NF-κB pathway proteins in TNF-α-treated SCAPs at different time points. (b) Semiquantitative analysis confirmed the upregulation of P-IκBα and P-P65 after the activation of NF-κB pathway. (c) The ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated form of P65. (d) The ratio of phosphorylated IκBα to unphosphorylated IκBα. (e) The protein levels of IκBα, P-IκBα, P65, and P-P65 in the cytoplasm of BMS-345541-treated SCAPs at indicated time points. (f) Semiquantitative analysis confirmed the declined expression of P-IκBα and P-P65 after the inhibition of NF-κB pathway. (g) The ratio of phosphorylated to unphosphorylated form of P65. (h) The ratio of P-IκBα to IκBα. Values are the means ± SD; n = 3; **P &lt; 0.01; ***P &lt; 0.001.</div></div>
