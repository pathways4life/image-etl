Data obtained from multiple assays indicate activation of the classical Notch signaling pathway in both the hMSCs and rNSCs. Notch signaling is thought to be unidirectional; therefore, the data suggest that Notch signaling is directed from hMSCs to rNSCs in some sub-populations of the cocultures and from rNSCs to hMSCs in other sub-populations.</div></div>
