This information is summarized by a key mediator protein and processed by a signal integrator, resulting in a specific cell fate. Lines with open circles: reaction catalysis; crossed circle: unspecified source or sink. Layout according to Systems Biology Graphical Notation 39. <b>B:</b> Activation dynamics of the signaling molecules shown in (A). The two different ligands stimulate different signaling molecules both of which can activate the same downstream molecule. Since this molecule summarizes the information from both upstream signaling molecules and transfers it to another molecule, it functions as a key mediator. The integral of the activated key mediator, defined as the area under the signaling curve, is illustrated by the filled area. This quantity directly correlates with the dynamic behavior of a long-living signal integrator and is thus a decoder for the information from the input signals. Potential signal integrators are stable mRNA molecules and the proteins they encode, which then execute the specific cell fate.</div></div>
