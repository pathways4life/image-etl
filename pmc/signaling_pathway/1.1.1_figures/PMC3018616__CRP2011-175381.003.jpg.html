From: Transforming Growth Factor-β1 as a Common Target Molecule for Development of Cardiovascular Diseases, Renal Insufficiency and Metabolic Syndrome. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Accelerated activation of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway causes CKD, MetS, and CVD.  Since TGF-β1 is a common target molecule and interactive regulator in those pathological conditions, manipulation of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway may be a useful approach for amelioration of mortality and morbidity in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors.</div></div>
