From: TGF-? and NF-?B signal <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> cross-talk is mediated through TAK1 and SMAD7 in a subset of head and neck cancers. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for attenuation of canonical TGF-β SMAD and activation of non-canonical TGF-β-NF-κB signaling pathways in HNSCC. TGF-β activates NF-κB signaling through a sequential regulation of TAK1 and IKK kinases leading to phosphorylation of IκBα, nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of NF-κB subunit p65 and activation of NF-κB downstream targets. Both TGF-β and NF-κB signaling induce expression of SMAD7, which in turn preferentially suppresses TGF-β induced canonical and NF-κB signaling, relative to TNF-α-induced NF-κB signaling.</div></div>
