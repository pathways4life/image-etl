From: Cooperation between Snail and LEF-1 Transcription Factors Is Essential for TGF-?1-induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A schematic representation of the proposed TGF-β1 signaling mechanism that promotes EMT. Early signaling through Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK-AP-1 causes up-regulation in Snail expression. Snail, a well-known repressor of junction proteins, then inhibits expression of claudin-1, claudin-2, and occludin. Snail also provides partial loss of E-cadherin, thus decreasing the level of substrate for β-catenin. Further stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin is achieved through PI3K signaling. Molecules downstream of PI3K such as AKT phosphorylate and deactivate p-GSK-3β, which is responsible for degrading both β-catenin and Snail through the ubiquitin proteosome pathway. Smad signaling, controlled through endocytosis of TGF-β receptor complex, promotes transcription of LEF-1, an alternative substrate for β-catenin. On forming β-catenin/LEF-1 complexes, these molecules will then act to transcribe genes that will induce EMT.</div></div>
