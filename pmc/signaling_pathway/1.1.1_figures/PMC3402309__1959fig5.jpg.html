From: Nesfatin-1 Action in the Brain Increases Insulin Sensitivity Through Akt/AMPK/TORC2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in Diet-Induced Insulin Resistance. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Effect of ICV nesfatin-1 on liver insulin signaling pathway. Four treatment groups were studied: NCA, NCN, HFA, and HFN. Central nesfatin-1 administration markedly increased liver InsR (A), IRS-1 (B), AMPK (C), and Akt (D) phosphorylation in both SD- and HFD-fed rats. Ratio of phosphorylated vs. total protein was calculated and is shown as means Â± SE (n = 5). *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01 vs. ICV ACF-infused rats (NCA), #P &lt; 0.05, ##P &lt; 0.01 vs. HFD-fed rats (HFA).</div></div>
