EDA is expressed in interfollicular cells; its receptor EDAR in follicular cells. Wnt/Lef1 and other putative signals (GATA, Nkx2 and ???) regulate transcription. The protein product ectodysplasin, is cleaved by furine-like proteases and bind to its receptor EDAR to initiate EDA signaling. EDAR recruits the cytoplasmic signaling adaptor protein EDRADD, and via TRAF6/TAK1/TAB2, the signaling activates the NEMO/IKK complex. That complex phosphorylates IkBs, leading to the entry of NFκBs into the nucleus and the activation of cognate gene transcription. Reported targets of EDA signaling include Wnt/Dkks, Shh, BMP/Sostdc1, LTβ and madcam1. EDA signaling may feedback regulate the Wnt pathway through Dkk4 and Dkk1. Asterisks indicate mutants that cause EDA-like phenotypes in patients and/or mouse models. Mutations in TRAF6, NEMO, IkBα or NFκBs also produce EDA-like phenotypes, but accompanied by immunodeficiency.</div></div>
