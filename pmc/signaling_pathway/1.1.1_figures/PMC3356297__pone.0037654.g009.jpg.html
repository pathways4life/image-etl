OsEDS1, <b>B</b>. OsPAL1, <b>C</b>. OsNH1, <b>D</b>. OsLOX2, <b>E</b>. OsAOS2. Marker genes for the SA-dependent defense pathway (OsEDS1, OsPAL1 and OsNH1) were all significantly induced by MoHrip1 on the second day after treatment, and the same expression pattern was found for the JA/Et pathway gene OsLOX2, but strong induction was not observed for OsAOS2 (another JA/Et signaling pathway marker gene). Dpi: days post-inoculation. Error bars represent Â± SD of the mean. Essentially identical results were obtained in three independent experiments.</div></div>
