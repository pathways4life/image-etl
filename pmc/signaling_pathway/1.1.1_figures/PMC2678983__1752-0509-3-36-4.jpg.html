Mapped on the pathway are the set of high-scored network nodes (set #1) and the set of differentially expressed genes (set #2). The datasets are visualized by thermometer-like symbols next to protein icons. Differentially expressed genes with a well-established relation to disease (e.g. STAT1, c-Myc) are cross-validated by high statistical scoring. Many additional important elements of the pathway are identified by topological scoring â€“ IFN-gamma, IRF-1, PKC-delta, CaMK II, CBP.</div></div>
