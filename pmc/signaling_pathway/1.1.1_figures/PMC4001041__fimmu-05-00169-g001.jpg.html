NF-κB is a master regulator of gene transcription and contributes to several hallmarks of cancer. NLRX1, NLRP12, and NLRC3 negatively regulate NF-κB signaling at multiple levels. NLRX1 interacts with and inhibits TRAF6 and the IKK complex resulting in the attenuation of NF-κB signaling following TLR stimulation. Likewise, NLRC3 was also shown to interact with TRAF6 and attenuate NF-κB signaling through a similar mechanism. NLRP12, has been shown to attenuate both the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway through modulating the phosphorylation of IRAK-1 and the non-canonical NF-κB pathway through interactions with TRAF3 and NIK.</div></div>
