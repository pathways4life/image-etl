From: The Oncoprotein HBXIP Uses Two Pathways to Up-regulate S100A4 in Promotion of Growth and Migration of Breast Cancer Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>The model illustrates proposed two pathways of regulation of S100A4 mediated by HBXIP.</b> The model shows that HBXIP up-regulates S100A4 through not only binding to STAT4, but also activating PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway independently of STAT4.</div></div>
