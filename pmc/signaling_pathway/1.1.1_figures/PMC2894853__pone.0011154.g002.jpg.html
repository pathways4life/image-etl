A positive score indicates an enrichment of microRNA targets for a disease-pathway interaction. Negative scores indicate depletion. <b>A</b>: Heatmap of microRNA target enrichment for a particular disease and pathway. Pathways and diseases are ordered by hierarchical clustering using Manhattan distance and ward clustering. <b>B</b>: Boxplot of disease-pathway associations ordered according to hierarchical clustering along the pathways. Red fields indicate an enrichments and blue a depletion. White fields indicate that no microRNA targets were found for this disease-pathway association.</div></div>
