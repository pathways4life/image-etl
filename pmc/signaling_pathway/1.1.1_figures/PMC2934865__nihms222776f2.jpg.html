From: Emerging Roles of SUMO Modification in Arthritis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Hypothetical model for SUMO regulation in NFκB pathway. Sumoylation of IκBα mediated by Ubc9 and RSUME competes off the ubiquitination pathway, which stabilizes IκBα and inhibits NFκB signaling. IL-1R is also sumoylated upon stimulation, which conduces to signal transduction. The question marks indicate processes which have not been fully substantiated experimentally.</div></div>
