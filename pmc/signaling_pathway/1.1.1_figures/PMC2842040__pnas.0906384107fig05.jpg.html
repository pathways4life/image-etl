Up-regulation of mevalonic acid pathway genes (mvaS.1, spy0686, mvaK1, mvaK2, mvaD) results in increased production of IPP, which binds to the TCR of host γδ T cells present in the mucosal epithelium. Binding of IPP to the TCR stimulates recruitment of lipid rafts necessary for TCR signaling. Host genes involved in organization of lipid raft and receptor clustering, such as Agrin, Flotillin-2, and NrCAM, show increased expression levels to coordinate TCR and coreceptor signaling. The activated TCR initiates a signal transduction cascade leading to increased expression of host MAP3KIP1 and GADD45B, both members of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, and MAP4K1, a hematopoietic-specific signaling kinase that activates the cellular stress activated signaling pathway (SAPK1). Gamma-delta T cells are key defenders of the host mucosal surface and TCR signaling leading to increased proliferation or T-cell anergy is likely to influence the immune response to GAS.</div></div>
