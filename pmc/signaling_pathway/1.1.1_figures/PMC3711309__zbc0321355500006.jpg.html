RTA is able to degrade the critical adaptor molecule, TRIF, for TLR3 signaling, and consequently blocks TLR3-mediated innate immunity directed against KSHV. At the same time, the virus is able to use the TLR3-TRIF pathway to enhance the expression of RTA, and to expedite the degradation process of TRIF, and furthermore to block the TLR3-mediated inhibitory effects on KSHV replication.</div></div>
