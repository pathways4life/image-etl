From: The Dynamic Role of Beta-Catenin in Synaptic Plasticity. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In the resting state, β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3β and rapidly degraded by the proteasome pathway. Upon activation of Wnt signaling, β-catenin is stabilized through the inhibition of GSK3β and translocates to the nucleus to regulate the expression of Wnt target genes. β-catenin also associates with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin and directly links to the actin cytoskeleton through α-catenin. Note that the cadherin adhesion complex is a dynamic structure that also includes other intermediate proteins (such as EPLIN, Abe K &amp; Takeichi M., 2008.</div></div>
