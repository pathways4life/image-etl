(B) and (C) sAPP induced generation of NICD in a time- and dose- dependent manner as indicated above. Generation of NICD was measured by Western blot analysis using anti-active Notch Ab. (D) sAPP induced NICD generation was suppressed by neutralizing antibody (22C11). One-factor ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis (Student-Newman-Keuls) was used to analyze the differences between experimental groups and control groups (*: p&lt;0.05, **: p&lt;0.01).</div></div>
