From: p21-activated kinases in Erbb2-positive breast cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Dimerization of ErbB2 receptors leads to phosphorylation and activation of several intracellular catalytic substrates, including the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk, PI3K/Akt and other important signaling pathways that regulate apoptosis, protein synthesis and cellular proliferation. Our experimental results summarized in this Extra View, demonstrate that ErbB2 signaling activates a Rac-Pak signaling pathway that contributes to ErbB2 mediated transformation through the Erk and Akt pathways.</div></div>
