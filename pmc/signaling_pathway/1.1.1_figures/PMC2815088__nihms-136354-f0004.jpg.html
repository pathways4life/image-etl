All of the pathways are triggered by insulin-like peptides binding to an insulin-like receptor. The binding event triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of an insulin receptor substrate (IRS, termed chico in Drosophila). This activates the PI3K leading to recruitment of PDK1, activation of AKT and phosphorylation of a Foxo protein (daf-16 in C. elegans). Phosphorylation of the Foxo protein leads to cytoplasmic ‘tethering’ of the transcription factor in the cytoplasm limiting its nuclear entry and transcriptional activation. Foxo may be O-GlcNAc-modified at the canonic AKT site leading to nuclear entry and transcriptional activation. In mammals, overexpression of OGT leads to insulin resistance by acting downstream of PI3K to modify key signaling molecules. Studies in both mammals, fly and C. elegans indicate that O-GlcNAc cycling impacts the insulin-signaling pathway at several points downstream of PI3K signaling (indicated by the red shaded area). In C. elegans (bottom panel) knockouts of ogt-1 and oga-1, the enymes of O-GlcNAc cycling causes changes in macronutrient stores as indicated. Genetic analysis suggests that ogt-1 is epistatic to oga-1 as expected. Insulin signaling in C. elegans controls the dauer diapause, longevity, and stress reponses, all of which are impacted by O-GlcNAc cycling (See table at bottom right).</div></div>
