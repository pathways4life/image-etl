Western blot analysis of the cell lysates from tumorspheres derived from MCF7 and T47D cells treated with ethanol (V); 0.1 nM of E2β; the AKT inhibitor IV (10 µM), IAkt; and E2β+IAkt, using indicated antibodies. (B). The effects of different inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β pathway on estrogen-stimulated growth of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. Tumorspheres of MCF7 and T47D cells were treated with vehicle, E2β alone or E2β together with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 µM), the GSK-3β inhibitor IX (10 µM), the AKT inhibitor IV (10 µM). After seven days, cell numbers from dissociated tumorspheres were determined. The columns represent the means of three experiments; bars, SE.</div></div>
