The concept of eliminative signaling (Huangfu and Fuchs 2010) is illustrated specifically on the example of IFN1 responses. IFN1 binds to the receptor (IFNAR) to activate JAK (stem signaling). JAK serves as a central signaling dispatcher that further distributes the cascades between forward signaling (ie, activation of STAT resulting in the transcriptional activation of ISGs) and eliminative signaling [ie, activation of protein kinase D2 (PKD2) and subsequent downregulation of the receptor]. Unrelated ligands such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) could utilize PKD2 or basal pathway to eliminate the receptor without benefits of forward signaling and ISG induction.</div></div>
