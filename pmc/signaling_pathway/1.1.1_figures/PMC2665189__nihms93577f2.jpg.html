Oral glucose tolerance was assessed in fasted animals by measuring plasma glucose at 0 and 90 minutes post-gavage of 10% glucose at a dose of 2 g/kg body weight.B. Fasting plasma insulin levels were measured by RIA.C. Components of the insulin signaling pathway were measured in liver and red gastrocnemius.IR, insulin receptor. **compared to respective Scd1+/+ counterparts.</div></div>
