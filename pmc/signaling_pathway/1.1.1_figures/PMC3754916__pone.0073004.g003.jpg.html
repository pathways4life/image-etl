(A) Relative expression level of miR-33a was conﬁrmed by way of real-time PCR. (B) Overexpression of miR-33a down-regulates mRNA levels of β-catenin in Chang liver and HepG2 cells. mRNA expression patterns of the related genes in β-catenin signaling pathway were analyzed in Chang liver (C) and HepG2 (D) cells with miR-33a overexpression.
