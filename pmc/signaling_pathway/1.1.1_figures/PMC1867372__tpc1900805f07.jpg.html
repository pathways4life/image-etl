From: The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Cascade MKK3-MPK6 Is an Important Part of the Jasmonate Signal Transduction <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in Arabidopsis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Possible Roles of MPK6 Signaling in Arabidopsis.At least three cascades, MKK2–MPK6, MKK4/MKK5–MPK6, and MKK3–MPK6, function in Arabidopsis. Each plays a specific role in response to different stimuli, and the cascades transduce their signals to adapt to various environmental changes by crosstalking with each other. The MKK2–MPK6 cascade regulates cold and salt stress-responsive genes, the MKK4/MKK5–MPK6 cascade regulates pathogen-responsive genes by activating ET biosynthesis, and the novel MKK3–MPK6 cascade regulates JA signaling. The JA-activated MKK3–MPK6 signal negatively regulates the JA pathway and affects JA-dependent gene expression and root growth sensitivity through ATMYC2.</div></div>
