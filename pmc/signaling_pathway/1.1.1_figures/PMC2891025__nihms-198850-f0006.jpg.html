Lines with arrowheads, molecule acts on a target; lines without arrowheads, binding only. Solid lines, direct interaction; dotted lines, indirect interaction. Blue background, high-abundance genes; green background, low-abundance genes; white background, member of signaling pathway but not regulated in Gαq hearts.</div></div>
