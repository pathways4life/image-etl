From: Laminin-?1 LG4-5 domain binding to dystroglycan mediates muscle cell survival, growth, and the AP-1 and NF-?B transcription factors but also has adverse effects. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A model of muscle cell signaling in response to 1E3. Intact laminin structure is depicted. Inset: 1E3 LG4–5 region. 1E3 binds to the DGC via α-DG. Other components of the DGC are shown, along with associated signaling below. Left: Rac1/JNK/c-jun pathway previously characterized (31, 47), which shows stimulation by 1E3 at all concentrations. Right: PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway (9, 45), which shows a biphasic response to 1E3. NF-κB has been closely associated with atrophy (4, 42) while Akt signaling is associated with resisting muscle atrophy (26). The p21 small G-protein CDC42 has been shown to be important to myofiber diameter and increases upon atrophy (5) but was not included in the studies here.</div></div>
