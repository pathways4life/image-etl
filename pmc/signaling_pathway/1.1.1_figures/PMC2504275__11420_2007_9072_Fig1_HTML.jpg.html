Wnt proteins bind to a receptor complex composed of members of the frizzled gene family (Fzd) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related proteins (LRP). Receptor binding inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3). In the absence of Wnt signaling, GSK-3 phosphorylates β-catenin and targets it to a degradation pathway mediated by the APC protein (APC). In the presence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin escapes phosphorylation and degradation and accumulates in the cytoplasm. Excess β-catenin enters the nucleus where it associates with the lymphoid enhancing factor (Lef)/T cell factor (Tcf) transcription factors to regulate gene expression. Secreted frizzled-related proteins (Sfrps) contain the ligand binding domain of frizzled but lack the transmembrane region; they can bind the Wnt ligands but cannot transduce the Wnt signal, and thus, effectively block Wnt signaling. Dickkopf (DKK) proteins are secreted factors which also block Wnt signaling by binding to the LRP receptors</div></div>
