For the MAPK immunoblotting, cells were incubated with 3×10−6 mol/L AZA for a series of times. Cells were harvested. Immunoblot analysis was performed by using antibodies to p-ERK, ERK, p-p38 kinase, p38 kinase, p-JNK, JNK, respectively. Representative blots and summary data are shown. Data is expressed as means±S.E.M. **p&lt;0.01 compared to Control. <b>B</b>, The effect of AZA on AQP1 expression in the presence of ERK inhibitor U0126. After pretreated with U0126 (2 mol/L) or vehicle for 30 min, cells were incubated with AZA for 24 hours.

For p-MLC immunoblotting, cells were incubated with 3×10−6 mol/L AZA for a series of times. Cells were harvested. Immunoblot analysis was performed by using antibodies to p-MLC and summary data is shown here.
