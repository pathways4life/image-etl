From: The role of JAK-STAT <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in adipose tissue function. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The JAK-STAT5 signaling pathway is activated by GH, PRL, and GM-CSF, and it regulates the development and/or function of preadipocytes, adipocytes, and macrophages in adipose tissue. Substantial evidence supports that STAT5 proteins are activated in preadipocytes and that they promote adipogenesis. In mature adipocytes, multiple STAT5 target genes have been identified, demonstrating a role for STAT5 in modulating key physiological properties of adipocytes. Studies also indicate that JAK-STAT5 signaling is important in the recruitment and development of adipose tissue macrophages.</div></div>
