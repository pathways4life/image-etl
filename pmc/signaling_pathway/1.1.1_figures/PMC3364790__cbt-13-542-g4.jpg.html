(A) The pathway analysis revealed that CRC metastasis signaling was among one of the top five canonical pathways that served as a target of AKBA-induced demethylation in CRC cells. (B) An illustration from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) demonstrating the biological relationship between demethylated and overexpressed genes from the 3 genes clusters. Green bolded BM represents the genes that are described as biomarkers of CRC, Orange Fx represents the genes that have direct function in CRC, and CP represents the canonical pathway involved in CRC metastasis signaling. One of the genes, SMPD3, which was found within the most demethylated gene group “cluster 1” in the methylation microarray analysis and subsequently confirmed in our validation analysis (expression by qRT-PCR and methylation by qMSP), is marked with “*” in red. Density of red color of icons and the number below the icons represents the fold change of gene expression induced by AKBA obtained in our genome-wide gene expression analysis.</div></div>
