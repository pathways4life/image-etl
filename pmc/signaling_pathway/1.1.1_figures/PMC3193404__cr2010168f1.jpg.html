From: Regulation of NF-?B <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> by caspases and MALT1 paracaspase. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">NF-κB signaling pathways initiated by TLR4, TCR, TNF receptor 1, CD40 and genotoxic stress. Left: canonical NF-κB signaling is initiated by the inducible formation of multiprotein complexes that can undergo non-degradative polyubiquitination (K63-linked or linear) and which are recognized by TAK1 and IKK kinase complexes. This leads to the activation of IKKβ, which phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor protein IκBα, resulting in its proteasomal degradation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (depicted as p50/p65). TNF receptor 1 can also initiate the formation of a caspase-8-containing complex that signals apoptosis. The places where caspases have been proposed to regulate NF-κB signaling are indicated. Middle: some receptors initiate a non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway that results in the activation of IKKα, which phosphorylates the NF-κB inhibitor p100, resulting in its processing to p52 and the formation of p52/RelB NF-κB complexes. Receptors initiating this pathway also initiate the formation of multiprotein complexes and ubiquitination (not shown in the figure), which results in the activation of the kinase NIK, which activates IKKα. Right: NF-κB activation by genotoxic stress results in the activation of a multiprotein complex (PIDDosome) in which the IKK adaptor NEMO is recruited. This is the beginning of a sequential series of modifications on NEMO, which alter its subcellular localization, providing a means to link genotoxic stress to the cytosolic IKK complex. An alternative PIDDosome complex recruits caspase-2 and initiates apoptosis.</div></div>
