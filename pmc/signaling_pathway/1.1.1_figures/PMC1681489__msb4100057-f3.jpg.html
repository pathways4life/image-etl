(<b>A</b>) EGFR signaling and GPCR signaling network has a small numbers of core elements such as small GTPases, PIPs, and non-RTKs for EGFR signaling, and calcium, cAMP, and inositol phosphate for GPCR signaling. For example, a group of stimuli may all activate core elements in the way that can be classified into region C1, for example, and these stimuli triggers transcription of genes and physiological responses as denoted as C1. (<b>B</b>) TLR signaling network has a salient feature where possible bow-tie core is composed of a single element, MyD88, thus there is no classifier hyperspace created within the bow-tie network. Differences of responses against various stimuli are modulated by the activation of elements in collateral pathways, such as small GTPases, PIPs, and TICAM1 involved in MyD88-independent pathway, and MyD88 pathway essentially calibrates the whole network. Thus, for TLR signaling network, the classifier hyperspace has four dimensions.</div></div>
