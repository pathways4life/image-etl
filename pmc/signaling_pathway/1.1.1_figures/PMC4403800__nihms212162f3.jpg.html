From: A mathematical model of intercellular <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> during epithelial wound healing. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic of simplified signaling pathway during wound healing: ligands (L) and ROS (S) are free to diffuse and bind to cell surface receptors. This binding forms complexes (CS and CL) that activate MAPK signaling. Complexes are lost due to endocytosis or, in the case of ligand-receptor complexes, through ligand unbinding and endocytosis. Intracellular proteases (P) release extracellular ligands (L). Note that receptor are assumed to be in excess. Conversely, ligand-ROS-receptor complexes are negligible.</div></div>
