From: Trauma-Hemorrhagic Shock Mesenteric Lymph Induces Endothelial Apoptosis That Involves Both Caspase-Dependent and Caspase-Independent Mechanisms. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>FIGURE 8.</b> Schematic diagram illustrating the major pro-apoptotic components of the caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptotic pathways as well as the sites where they are inhibited by Z-VAD-fmk. Caspase-dependent apoptosis occurs either through the death receptor or the mitochondrial-mediated pathway. In the death receptor pathway, the initiator caspase, caspase-8 is activated while, in the mitochondrial pathway, the initiator caspase, caspase-9 is activated. Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 ultimately turn on the effector caspase arm of the pathway as reflected in activated caspase-3. In caspase-independent apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization triggers the release of death-promoting factors such as AIF or the serine protease Omni/htra2, which cause caspase-independent death signaling downstream from the mitochondria. As illustrated, z-VAD-fmk, the pan-caspase inhibitor, blocks both caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways at multiple sites. However, it has no effect on the caspase-independent apoptotic pathway. The results of the current study indicate that T/HS lymph-induced HUVEC apoptosis is occurring through all 3 apoptotic pathways and thus involves caspase-dependent and caspase-independent processes.</div></div>
