Many cellular signaling events are intrinsically linked to G1 phase of the cell cycle, which is controlled by the RB pathway. Signaling to the RB pathway and thus G1 control by different cellular processes is achieved mainly through the regulation of cyclins and CDK inhibitors (CKIs). In mammalian cells, mitogenic signals first induce the synthesis of D-type cyclins, leading to activation of cyclin-D-dependent CDK4 and CDK6, and then induce E-type cyclins to activate CDK2. Cyclin-D–CDK4/6 and cyclin-E–CDK2 cooperatively phosphorylate RB-family proteins, derepressing E2F to allow transcription of E2F-target genes, thereby promoting the G1/S transition. The INK4 proteins specifically inhibit CDK4 and CDK6, whereas the p21 (CIP/KIP) family of CKIs inhibits multiple CDKs. Although the schematic illustration is based on mammalian cells, the regulation of both G1 cyclins and CDK inhibitors is evolutionarily conserved.</div></div>
