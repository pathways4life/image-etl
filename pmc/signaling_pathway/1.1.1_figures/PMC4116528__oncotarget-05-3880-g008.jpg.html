The Smad1/Akt/GSK3β <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> is consistently activated in CL1-5 cells but is downregulated in Snail-silenced CL1-5 cells.  From: Snail regulates Nanog status during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the Smad1/Akt/GSK3? <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> in non-small-cell lung cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) CL1-5 cells, which endogenously express Snail, exhibited greater activation of the Smad1/Akt/GSK3β pathway and upregulated Nanog expression in comparison to CL1-0 cells. Both SB431542 and LDN193189 decreased activation of the Smad1/Akt/GSK3β pathway and downregulated Nanog expression in CL1-5 cells. Unlike Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation, which was completely inhibited by LY294002, Smad1 phosphorylation did not respond to LY294002. (B/C) Scramble and Smad1 siRNA were expressed in CL1-5 cells for 40 h. The Smad1 siRNA fully suppressed the Smad1/Akt/GSK3β pathway as well as Nanog expression. In addition, the expression of mesenchymal markers decreased, but the expression of epithelial markers increased in Smad-silenced CL1-5 cells as compared to CL1-0 cells. (D) The endogenously expressed Snail was silenced in CL1-5 cells. An increase in E-cadherin and a decrease in vimentin expression were found in Snail-silenced CL1-5 cells. (E) In addition, a reduction in the number of migrating cells was observed in Snail-silenced CL1-5 cells as compared to the control cells (transfected with Scramble siRNA); ***p &lt; 0.001 indicates statistical significance as compared to the control. (F) Either a decrease in the level of activation of the Smad1/Akt/GSK3β pathway or a reduction in Nanog expression was found in Snail-silenced CL1-5 cells.</div></div>
