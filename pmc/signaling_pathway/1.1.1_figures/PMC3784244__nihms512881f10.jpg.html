Whereas acute social defeat activates the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway to the level enough to counteract induction of social avoidance by social defeat (left), repeated exposure to social defeat activates PGE2-EP1 signaling, which attenuates the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway, leading to social avoidance (right).</div></div>
