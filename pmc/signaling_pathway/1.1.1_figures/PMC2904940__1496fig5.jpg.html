(A) HeLa cells stably expressing either vector control or siRNA-resistant WT-CNK1 or ΔCBD-CNK1 were transfected with control or CNK1-siRNAs prior to serum starvation and insulin treatment. Lysates were prepared and examined by immunoblot analysis as indicated. (B) Serum-straved HeLa cells were left untreated or were treated overnight with the cytohesin inhibitor SecinH3 (20 μM) prior to insulin stimulation. Lysates were prepared and examined by immunoblot analysis. (C) HeLa cells stably expressing vector control or Q67L-Arf6 were transfected with control or CNK1-siRNAs prior to serum starvation and insulin treatment. Lysates were prepared and examined by immunoblot analysis. (D) HeLa cells transfected with control, Arf1, Arf6, or Arf1, and Arf6-siRNAs were serum-starved and then treated or not with insulin prior to lysis. Lysates were examined by immunoblot analysis.</div></div>
