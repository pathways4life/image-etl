Diverse effects of <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways on MUC2 and MUC5AC expression in PK-8 and PCI-35 cells..  From: A GNAS Mutation Found in Pancreatic Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms Induces Drastic Alterations of Gene Expression Profiles with Upregulation of Mucin Genes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) The regulation of MUC2 expression in PK-8 cells was predominantly mediated by the GPCR pathway, with synergistic effects of the MAPK pathway and additive effects of the PI3K pathway. Minimal interactions existed among the 3 signaling pathways themselves. (B) MUC2 expression in PCI-35 cells was regulated predominantly by the MAPK pathway and additively by the PI3K pathway, whereas the GPCR pathway was antagonistic. Active interactions existed among the signaling pathways: cAMP was upregulated by active MAPK and downregulated by active PI3K. (C) MUC5AC expression in PK-8 cells was regulated predominantly by the GPCR pathway, the MAPK pathway was antagonistic, and the PI3K pathway played a weak role. (D) MUC5AC expression in PCI-35 cells was regulated predominantly by the MAPK pathway, whereas both the PI3K and GPCR pathways were antagonistic.</div></div>
