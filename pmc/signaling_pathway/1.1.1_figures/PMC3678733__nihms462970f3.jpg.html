A. A diagram of the Hippo/STK signaling pathway as annotated in Reactome, using SBGN-like iconography to display proteins and complexes (rectangles) and small molecules (ovals), connected by reaction edges that distinguish inputs (plain end), outputs (arrowhead end) and catalysis (open-circle end) as well as reaction type (open box reaction node, chemical transformation; closed circle, binding). B. A portion of the manually annotated pathway is enlarged and overlaid with proteins found in high-throughput surveys (Wu et al. 2010) to interact with Hippo pathway components STK3 (MST2) or STK4 (MST1) or both. C) The manually annotated pathway is overlaid with small molecules from the ChEMBL database (Gaulton et al. 2012) that bind STK3 (MST2) or STK4 (MST1) or both.</div></div>
