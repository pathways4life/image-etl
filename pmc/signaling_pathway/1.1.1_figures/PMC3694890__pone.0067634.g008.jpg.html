The GBR2 interactome revealed connections of RTK pathways with both classical GRB2-SOS-RAS cascade with PI3K-IRS1 cascade leading to AKT and ERK activation. The crosstalk between growth factor and cytokine signaling pathways as revealed by major receptors and adaptors and other downstream proteins. Upregulation of negative regulation of immune signaling pathways in tumor cells indicate the preparedness of tumor cells to fight and survive attack from host immune signaling mechanisms. Novel interactions are marked by red arrows.</div></div>
