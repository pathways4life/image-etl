(<b>C</b> and <b>D</b>) The adult lifespan extension associated with the oga-1(ok1207) mutant is not synergistic or additive with mutations of the long-lived insulin signaling pathway kinase age-1 (<b>C</b>) or sgk-1 (<b>D</b>). Lifespan curves (<b>A-D</b>) are based on pooled data from multiple replicates as described in Table 1. Control curves are re-plotted to facilitate comparisons in panels <b>A-D</b>.</div></div>
