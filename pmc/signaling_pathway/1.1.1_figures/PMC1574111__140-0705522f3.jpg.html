From: FK506 potentiates NGF-induced neurite outgrowth via the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed mechanism for FK506-potentiated neurite outgrowth. TrkA activation by NGF leads to activation of multiple signaling pathways, including Ras/Raf/MAPK. FK506 interacts with constituents of the mature steroid receptor complex (HSP90 via FKBP52; Gold et al., 1999a), which putatively enhances the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway. Line patterns indicate results from our experiments. Hashed arrows are putative links; thin arrows indicate pathways established by other studies (Huang &amp; Reichardt, 2001).</div></div>
