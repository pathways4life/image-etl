Positively regulated targets include genes characteristic of the mesendoderm developmental lineage. Genes negatively regulated by Nodal signaling include some trophoblast markers; the mechanism of this regulation remains to be determined. The regulation of Id gene expression by Nodal-Smad2 is indirect, via the BMP signaling pathway. The transcriptional regulation of Smad7 by Nodal signaling is the major contributor to the modulation of the BMP signaling pathway. BMP pathway activation and Id gene expression are essential components to maintain ES cell pluripotency.</div></div>
