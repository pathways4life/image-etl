In contrast, the standard 5-HT2A agonist TCB2 did not produce a modulation of the D2R agonist-induced inhibition of the AC–PKA–CREB pathway and the endogenous ligand 5-HT significantly reduced the signaling of this pathway. A biased 5-HT2A agonism with DOI was also observed in the facilitatory D2LR–5-HT2A receptor–receptor interaction of the heteromer, which enhances 5-HT2A signaling over Gq/11–PLC when using 5-HT and TCB2 as 5-HT2A agonists. Thus, when using DOI as a 5-HT2A agonist, a D2R agonist instead diminished 5-HT2A protomer signaling over the Gq/11–PLC pathway.</div></div>
