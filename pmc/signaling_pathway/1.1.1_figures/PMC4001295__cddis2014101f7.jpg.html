(<b>a</b>) BMP-2 activates the canonical BMP/Smad signaling pathway and non-canonical MAPK pathways to regulate osteoblastic differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. In the activated MAPK pathways, only p38 and ERK1/2 signaling are required to regulate the expression and activation of Runx2. (<b>b</b>) TNF-α and IL-1β also activate p38, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2 signaling, but they act to oppose the effects of BMP-2 on Runx2 expression and osteoblastic differentiation. (<b>c</b>) Without the positive influence of BMP/Smad signaling, both ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 signaling are activated, but BMP-2-induced Runx2 activity is inhibited, resulting in the suppression of osteoblastic differentiation</div></div>
