From: MTA1 Coregulator Regulates LPS Response via MyD88-dependent <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>MTA1 regulates LPS response via TLR4 MyD88-dependent signaling.</b> A and B, qPCR analysis of TLR4, TLR2, TLR3, and INF-β mRNA expressions in LPS-stimulated MEFs and macrophages isolated from MTA1+/+ and MTA1−/− mice, respectively. C, Western blot analysis of phospho-ERK (P-ERK), ERK, phospho-JNK (P-JNK), and JNK in MTA1+/+ and MTA1−/− MEFs in the presence and absence of LPS. D, schematic representation of MTA1 regulating LPS response via MyD88-dependent signaling: LPS stimulation of macrophages is accompanied by transcriptional stimulation of MTA1 through NF-κB pathway. Once MTA1 is induced, it acts as a coactivator and gets recruited to the MyD88 promoter, leading to increased MyD88 expression, which in turn, further potentiates NF-κB signaling as well as MyD88 transcription.</div></div>
