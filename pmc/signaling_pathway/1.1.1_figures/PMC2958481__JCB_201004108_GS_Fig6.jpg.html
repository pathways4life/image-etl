From: A mechanism for vertebrate Hedgehog <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>: recruitment to cilia and dissociation of SuFu-Gli protein complexes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>A model for activation of Gli proteins during vertebrate Hh signaling.</b> In the resting state of the Hh pathway (left), SuFu forms inactive complexes with Gli2 and Gli3-FL, which are sequestered in the cytoplasm. Without Hh stimulation, SuFu–Gli complexes traffic to the primary cilium at a low level independently of Smo; this basal ciliary trafficking is antagonized by PKA. Hh pathway stimulation (right) leads to the translocation of active Smo to the cilium, which, in turn, recruits SuFu–Gli complexes. Active Smo at cilia causes the dissociation of SuFu from Gli. Monomeric SuFu and Gli leave the cilium followed by Gli nuclear translocation and activation of the transcriptional program of the Hh pathway. PKA antagonizes Hh signaling by blocking ciliary localization of SuFu–Gli complexes, thus preventing coupling between active Smo and dissociation of SuFu–Gli complexes.</div></div>
