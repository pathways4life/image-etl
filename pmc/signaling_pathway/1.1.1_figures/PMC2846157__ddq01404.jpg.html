(<b>A</b>) Wnt signaling pathway genes were over-expressed in Prkar1a+/− sarcomas, pituitary and thyroid tumors, papillomas from all three experiments, as demonstrated by a qRT–PCR array study that included 84 genes from this pathway. (<b>B</b>) Strong staining for Ctnnb1 in Prkar1a+/− papillomas, Prkar1a+/− Trp53+/− sarcomas and Prkar1a+/− Rb1+/− pituitary tumors. (<b>C</b>) Wnt3 immunoreactivity was higher in Prkar1a+/− papillomas than in WT papillomas. (<b>D</b>) Lrp5 protein was over-expressed in Prkar1a+/− papillomas and double heterozygous tumors. *P &lt; 0.05.</div></div>
