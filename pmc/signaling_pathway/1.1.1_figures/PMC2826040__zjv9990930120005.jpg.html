(Top) CREB pathway comprised of miR-223 targets; (bottom) expression changes of miR-223 and its targets associated with the CREB pathway in r1918-infected samples. Red represents microRNA or targets that have increased expression in r1918-infected samples, relative to Tx/91-infected samples. Green represents microRNA or targets that have decreased expression in r1918-infected samples, relative to Tx/91-infected samples.</div></div>
