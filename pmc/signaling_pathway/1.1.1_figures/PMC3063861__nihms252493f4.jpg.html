A) Binding of a biased ligand (purple: β arrestin bias; blue: G-protein bias), to an unbiased receptor results in a biased response activating either G-protein mediated or β-arrestin pathway. B) Similarly, binding of an unbiased ligand to the biased receptor (β-arrestin-biased in purple or G protein-biased in blue) also results in a biased response (Reproduced with permission from Ref [31]).</div></div>
