Genes from the Drosophila mTOR signaling pathway that were differentially transcribed after pollen feeding or varroa parasitism. The pathway was modified from KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes http://www.kegg.com/. Grey indicates the presence of genes in the bee genome. Squares and circles indicate genes and enriched functions that were up- and downregulated between two treatments, respectively.</div></div>
