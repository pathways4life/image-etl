From: Statistical Analysis Reveals Co-Expression Patterns of Many Pairs of Genes in Yeast Are Jointly Regulated by Interacting Loci. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) One module contains two silencing genes, UBP10 and HMLALPHA1. The regulatory loci contain two oxidative stress response genes, Gre2 and Hog1.; (B) One module contains two silencing genes, SPT23 and RPD3. The regulatory loci contain two oxidative stress response genes, Ste11 and Vms1; (C) A diagram showing the module A related pathway, which indicates a potential regulatory relationship between oxidative stress response and Ubp10 induced silencing process; (D) A diagram showing the module B related pathway. The epistatic interaction between the two candidates Vms1 and Ste11 indicates the potential crosstalk between caloric restriction response and oxidative stress. Moreover, Ste11 may also regulate Pbs2-Hog1 signaling pathway under oxidative stress besides osmotic stress response.</div></div>
