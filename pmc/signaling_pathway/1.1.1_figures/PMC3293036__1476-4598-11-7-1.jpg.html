In the presence of active Wnt, Î²-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm, then localizes to the nucleus, and activates transcription together with TCF/LEF transcription factors. Negative regulators are depicted in red and positive regulators in green. Activation of the mTOR pathway is also directly regulated by Wnt-dependent downregulation of GSK3 kinase activity which is depicted in yellow.</div></div>
