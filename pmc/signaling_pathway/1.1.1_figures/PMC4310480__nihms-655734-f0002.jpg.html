(<b>a</b>) Hh pathway is activated in a ligand-independent manner through lost-of-function mutations in the negative regulators of the pathway such as Ptch (indicated with the asterisk) or SuFu, or by gain-of-function mutations in the positive regulators like Smo. This has been found in BCC, MB and rhabdomyosarcoma. (<b>b</b>) Autocrine activation of the Hh pathway. The Hh ligand is produced by the tumorigenic cell, tumor or stem cell, and activates the Hh signaling pathway in a cell-autonomous manner. This has been described in small cell lung cancer, pancreatic, colon, prostate, breast cancers, glioblastoma, melanomas, CML and B-cell lymphoma. (<b>c</b>) Paracrine activation of the Hh pathway occurs when the Hh ligand is produced by the tumor cells and the pathway is activated in the neighboring stroma cells which in turn produce factors that stimulate the growth of the tumor cells. This activation has been reported for pancreatic and colon cancer. (<b>d</b>) Inverse paracrine activation of the Hh pathway in which the stroma cells produce the Hh ligand and the tumor cells respond has been shown in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma.</div></div>
