Upd-lacZ expression at the posterior center (red in C’ and D’) marks the cells secreting Upd. <b>E-F:</b> Upd was distributed far from secreting cells in both 2nd instar larval stage (E-E”) and 3rd instar larval stage (F-F”). Extracellular Upd staining (green in E’ and F’) can be detected in the entire eye disc. In all images, the anterior compartment faces left, and the dorsal compartment faces up.</div></div>
