From: The Neuroprotective Role of Acupuncture and Activation of the BDNF <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Acupuncture can increase the expression of BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) via PI3K/Akt (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase) and MEK/ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinases) signaling pathway by activating the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), a high affinity catalytic receptor for several neurotrophins that induce the activation of survival signaling pathway. This ultimately leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) that mediates transcription of BDNF gene expression leading to neuroprotection. In this article, we hypothesize that cyclophilin A (CypA) plays an important role in the activation of BDNF. On the contrary, BDNF may also be an important upstream factor in regulating CypA expression during acupuncture treatment. Thus, the exact mechanism between the effect of acupuncture and the expression of CypA is still unknown.</div></div>
