From: Identification of core T cell network based on immunome interactome. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>T cell PPI Network mapped to TCR, with main JAK-STAT and MAPK signaling pathways.</b> The figure shows the TCR and the main JAK-STAT and MAPK signaling networks that are connected to the TCR-dependent T cell response. The pathway information is adapted from the KEGG Pathways resource. The TPPIN proteins are represented by red-colored boxes with protein names in white text. The signaling network demonstrates the effectiveness of the filtering approach as many of the central proteins in T cell response are left intact after filtering.</div></div>
