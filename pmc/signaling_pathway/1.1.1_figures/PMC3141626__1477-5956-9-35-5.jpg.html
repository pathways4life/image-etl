Proteins identified in Table 1 were imported into Pathway Studio, and an interaction map was generated with information from ResnetCore of Ariadne Genomics, and KEGG Pathway database. Legend of the interaction network is summarized on the right of the figure. Phosphoproteins, which are identified as phosphorylated targets of EGF signaling, were highlighted on the map (blue).</div></div>
