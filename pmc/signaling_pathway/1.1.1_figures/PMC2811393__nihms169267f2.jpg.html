Cells were transfected with control siRNAs (Control) or siRNAs against PIK3CB (PIK3CB) or PIK3CA (PIK3CA). Three days after transfection, serum-deprived cells were stimulated with 20% FBS (final concentration) and lysates were analyzed for effects on PI3K pathway signaling through phospho-Akt (p-Akt) and phospho-S6 (p-S6) immunoblotting. Shown are representative immunoblots obtained from at least three experiments per cell line. B, effect of p110α/p110β dual knockdown on PI3K signaling. Cells were transfected with control siRNAs or a mixture of PIK3CA and PIK3CB siRNAs (CA/CB), treated as above and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Representative results obtained in at least two experiments per cell line are shown.</div></div>
