The left subfigure shows an abstract of the insulin signaling pathway where expressed genes in liver and muscle and their corresponding downstream affected functions are included. The right panel displays the tissue-specific regulation of genes within the same functional category; putative TFs are those significantly overrepresented on the promoters of corresponding genes.</div></div>
