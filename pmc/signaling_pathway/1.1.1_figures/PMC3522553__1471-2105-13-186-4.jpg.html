The whole data was partitioned randomly with selecting 2/3 data as training dataset and 1/3 data as testing dataset. The whole procedure was repeated 10 times and the averaged performance was calculated. Cell line No. 1â€“4 corresponding to BxPC-3, NCI-H446, SW1990 and NCI-H157 respectively.</div></div>
