From: Tumor Necrosis Factor-? Induces Stress Fiber Formation through Ceramide Production: Role of Sphingosine Kinase. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed scheme for the signaling pathway of TNF-α leading to stress fiber formation. The figure illustrates how ceramide formation can contribute to the signaling pathways whereby TNF-α induces the formation of stress fibers. The ceramide-mediated pathway depends upon the formation of Ras-GTP and the activations of PI 3-K and SK. In addition, TNF-α also induces the tyrosine phosphorylations of FAK and paxillin and stress fiber formation independently of the activation of Ras and PI 3-K.</div></div>
