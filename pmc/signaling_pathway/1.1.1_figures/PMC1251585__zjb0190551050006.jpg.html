The schematic diagram is not to scale but shows the signaling flow through the Rcs cascade. Question marks indicate experimentally unresolved issues. RcsF localization to the outer membrane is according to in silico predictions based on the amino acid sequence and A. Jacq (personal communication; see Discussion). Amino acids involved in the phosphorelay are indicated. The shaded areas of RcsA and RcsB indicate the DNA-binding domains of these proteins. A dashed arrow points to genes that are RcsB dependent but RcsA independent. A blocked line indicates a gene repressed by an RcsA-RcsB heterodimer, and a solid arrow points to genes that require RcsA and RcsB for activation (see the text for details).</div></div>
