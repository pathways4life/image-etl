Experimental data are important for signaling pathway quantification using mathematical models. The experimental data in turn can gain from the model by testing a hypothesis in silico or designing new experiments to test the hypothesis in vivo or in vitro. It is a combination of both the approaches that could lead us to a wholesome understanding of the human brain, i.e., the holy grail of neuroscience.</div></div>
