(b and c) RNF8 and Chfr synergistically regulate ATM auto-phosphorylation and the ATM-dependent signaling pathway following DNA damage. MEFs (b) and Thymocytes (c) were treated with or without IR, lysed and subjected to Western blot using the indicated antibodies. (d) Chfr and RNF8 synergistically regulate ATM kinase activity. In vitro kinase assay was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot. Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining is shown below for loading control. (e) RNF8 and Chfr double deficiency abrogates G1/S checkpoint activation. BrdU assay was performed and mean values were calculated from three independent experiments. Error bar represent s.e.m. (f) DNA damage-induced G2/M checkpoint is abrogated in DKO cells. G2/M checkpoint assay was performed and mean values were calculated from three independent experiments. Error bar represent s.e.m.</div></div>
