The p38 pathway is the best-described signaling pathway that regulates AU-rich element (ARE)-mediated cytokine degradation. Activation of IL-1Î² receptors and the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family stimulates p38 MAPK signaling via signaling intermediates, including MKK3/6. Active p38 dictates mRNA stability through activation of MK2, which subsequently phosphorylates and inactivates TTP. Once inactivated, phosphorylated TTP dissociates from the ARE region of cytokine transcripts to enhance mRNA stability and translation, thereby causing an increase in cytokine secretion that can promote chronic inflammation and inflammatory disease progression if not properly regulated. In addition, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway can also post-transcriptionally regulate mRNAs through AKT phosphorylation of RBPs. This phosphorylation alleviates the mRNAs of RBPs that normally destabilize the mRNA and results in increased mRNA stability and thus increased cytokine protein production and secretion, which, if not properly controlled, can induce chronic inflammation.</div></div>
