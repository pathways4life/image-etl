Derivatives generated in addition to full-length constructs are shown below the protein structures. (B) Yeast two-hybrid analysis of CWI pathway components and PRO40. Yeast cells were drop-plated on SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine. Empty squares indicate that interactions were not tested. (C) Schematic overview of signal transduction and protein-protein interactions within the PRO40-CWI complex. Signaling through the pathway is depicted by gray arrows; interactions are depicted by black arrows. (D) Interaction sites between PRO40, PKC1, MIK1, MEK1, and MAK1. Black bars represent interaction sites tested in yeast two-hybrid analyses (A, B). For reasons of clarity, only PRO40 is depicted as homodimer.</div></div>
