In SM22-tet-BMPR2R899X mice, the levels of GTP-RhoA and MYPT1 phosphorylation were elevated, thus indicating that Rho/Rho-kinase signaling was activated. Two possible pathways, namely the Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways, in which BMP/TGF-β signaling activated Rho/Rho-kinase signaling are known. We confirmed that the Smad-dependent pathway was not altered. We therefore speculate that Rho/Rho-kinase signaling was activated via the Smad-independent pathway. Rho-GEF, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PP1c, catalytic subunit; M20, a 20-kDa subunit of unknown function; P, inorganic phosphate.</div></div>
