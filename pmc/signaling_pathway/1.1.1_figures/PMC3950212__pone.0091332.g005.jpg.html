MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with various concentrations (2, 4, and 8 μM) of LFG-500 for 24 h. Total expression and phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 were analyzed by Western blotting. β-actin was used as a loading control. (<b>B</b>) LFG-500 inhibits the expression of PI3K p85α/γ and p-AKT. The expression of target proteins was determined by Western blotting. Densitometric analysis of the proteins studied (right). *P&lt;0.05 or **P&lt;0.01 represents significant difference from the control group.</div></div>
