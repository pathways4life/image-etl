Illustrative schematic of the two pathways used to generate the simulated data. <b>(a) </b>The Linear network of 30 nodes/gene products, each of which is associated with one gene. The pair of squiggly lines across some arrows is used to indicate that there are more nodes that are not shown. <b>(b) </b>The Erbb signaling pathway from the KEGG pathway database [44]. The expressions of the genes associated with the nodes circled in red are correlated with each other and are the genes that were affected by the treatment.</div></div>
