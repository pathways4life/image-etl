Schematic diagram showing the intracellular pathways for IGF1, AR or combination of the both growth factors involved in serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines.  From: Cooperation of amphiregulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 inhibits Bax- and Bad-mediated apoptosis via a protein kinase C-dependent <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> in non-small cell lung cancer cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>A:</b> Signaling pathways activated by IGF1 or AR growth factors used as single agent. IGF1 activates the IGF1 receptor and the PI3K/Akt pathway. AR activates the EGF receptor which is linked to the MAPK/ERK and the PI3K/Akt pathways. Both IGF1 and EGF receptors converge to the inactivation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad. <b>B:</b> Survival pathway activated by the cooperation of IGF1 and AR growth factors. AR and IGF1, present in the H358 CM, activate both IGF1 and EGF receptors (box) (11). This cooperation induces a PKC-dependent survival pathway, independent of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. This anti-apoptotic pathway leads to Bad phosphorylation on Ser112 and inhibition of conformational change of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Inhibitors used are mentioned in blue.</div></div>
