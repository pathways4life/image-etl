There are three main TLR-mediated pathways of DNA repair. The protein encoded by myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and its downstream signaling proteins (not shown) may inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3), which hinders phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and therefore, prevents further signaling via Ras-MAPK pathway. In addition, MyD88 and its downstream signaling proteins (not shown) along with pERK activate AP-1 transcription factor, which promotes transcription of certain DNA repair genes. Finally, IL-12 and IL-23, which enhance DNA repair and whose transcription is also amplified by MyD88-regulated transcription factors, bind to their receptors, activate Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway, and increase further transcription of their own encoding genes.</div></div>
