From: Distinct Functions of Sox2 Control Self-Renewal and Differentiation in the Osteoblast Lineage   . </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model for the multiple mechanisms by which Sox2 regulates the osteoblast lineage. Sox2 maintains stemness and self-renewal by transcriptional mechanisms, fostering expression of genes such as Bmi-1 that are necessary for the self-renewal of osteoprogenitor cells. Sox2 also regulates transcription of genes in the Wnt pathway (e.g., APC, GSK3β, and Fzd receptor genes) whose upregulation or downregulation would inhibit Wnt signaling. Additionally, Sox2 downregulates canonical Wnt signaling by interacting through its C-terminal activation domain (R1) with β-catenin, thus inhibiting the prodifferentiation Wnt pathway.</div></div>
