The bars represent -log (P value) for a system or a pathway to be represented with a threshold set at 1.4 (P &lt; 0.05) in n = 3/group. CCI presents as an infectious disease, with CD28 Th cell signaling and T cell apoptosis among unique pathways activated relative to sham-operated nerve (asterisks).</div></div>
