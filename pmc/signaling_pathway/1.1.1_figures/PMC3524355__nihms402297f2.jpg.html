From: DNA damage, chromatin, and transcription: the trinity of aging. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Double-strand breaks occurring in eu- or hetero-chromatin are sensed by the DDR surveillance machinery and signaling is initiated. Chromatin remodeling complexes are recruited and relax chromatin structure (left pathway). This leads to amplification of DDR signaling and the initiation of downstream effector pathways such as DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. In the absence of effective chromatin remodeling, and possibly in highly condensed heterochromatin, (right pathway), DDR signaling is restrained and downstream pathways are inhibited. As a result of DDR signaling, global gene expression programs can be altered through chromatin factor redistribution and DDR-induced local and global transcriptional changes.</div></div>
