From: Cardiac PI3K-Akt Impairs Insulin-Stimulated Glucose Uptake Independent of mTORC1 and GLUT4 Translocation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Insulin signaling and glucose transport in normal hearts and in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In a healthy heart, insulin activates PI3K-Akt signaling and promotes GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface to facilitate glucose transport. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes is characterized by hyperinsulinemia. A persistent increase in circulating insulin activates PI3K-Akt leading to mTOR-S6K negative feedback signaling to IRS1/2. Activation of PI3K-Akt signaling in the heart rapidly impairs insulin-stimulated glucose uptake before inactivation of IRS by this negative feedback pathway. Although GLUT4 translocation may be maintained or increased, glucose uptake is decreased, suggesting the existence of a GLUT4 postinsertion activation mechanism, which is impaired in hearts with chronic activation of PI3K and Akt.</div></div>
