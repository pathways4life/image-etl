(A) Genetic models of the pathway of phytochrome signal transduction. In the multiple-pathway model (i) specific and shared signaling components can transduce signals independently of one another. In the alternative single-pathway model shown (ii), loci specific to a single phytochrome-signaling pathway (e.g., FAR1) are shown upstream of those components shared by multiple pathways (e.g., PIF3). (B) Speculative molecular modes of action for FAR1. Although we speculate in A that FAR1 is upstream of PIF3 on the basis of genetic data, its biochemical action may lie before that of PIF3 (i) or after it (ii). Either could produce a specific effect on phyA signaling.</div></div>
