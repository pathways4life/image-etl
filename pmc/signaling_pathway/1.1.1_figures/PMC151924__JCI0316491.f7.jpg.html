(<b>a</b>) Virus infection of the heart stimulates cytokine-receptor signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway. Activation of the JAK-STAT pathway induces antiviral target gene transcription stimulating the innate viral defense in the cardiac myocyte. (<b>b</b>) While activation of the JAK-STAT pathway has an important role in antiviral defense, phosphorylated STAT also induces SOCS expression that attenuates the innate antiviral defense by inhibiting JAK signaling. As in SOCS1-transgenic mice, increased expression of SOCS in cardiac myocytes results in robust virus replication and cardiac injury. (<b>c</b>) The strategies aimed at inhibition of SOCS potentiate the innate antiviral actions of cytokines that utilize the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in the prevention of virus-mediated myocardial injury. P, phosphorylated.</div></div>
