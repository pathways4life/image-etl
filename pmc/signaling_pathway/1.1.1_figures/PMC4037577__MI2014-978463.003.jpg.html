From: Obesity, Inflammation, and Lung Injury (OILI): The Good. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The anti-inflammatory mechanism of omentin. Omentin activates AMPK, which further blocks E-selection and reduces endothelial inflammation. AMPK also activates eNOS, which has vasodilation effect and blocks JNK signaling. JNK activates inflammation through TNFα mediated COX2 effect. Moreover, omentin inhibits NF-κB signaling pathway and thus inhibits inflammation. Under obese state, the production of omentin is lower which is associated with worse proinflammation and possible lung injury.</div></div>
