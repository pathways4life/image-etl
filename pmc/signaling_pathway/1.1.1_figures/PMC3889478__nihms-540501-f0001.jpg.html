From: Epithelial and mesenchymal contribution to the niche: a safeguard for intestinal stem cell homeostasis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Comparison of in vivo (left) and in vitro (right) signaling support to the intestinal stem cell. Signaling networks between the Paneth cell and stem cell appear to be broadly conserved. However, disruption on one element of a single pathway highlights the important compensation wired into the system where in vivo environments can rely upon mesenchymal cells to maintain signaling homeostasis. Wnt, Notch and signaling pathways are key players in the balance between stem cell maintenance and differentiation.</div></div>
