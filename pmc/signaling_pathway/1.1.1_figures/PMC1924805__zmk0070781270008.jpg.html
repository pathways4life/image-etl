Adhesion of growth factor-deprived PECs to LM5 via α3β1 and α6β4 integrin mediates cell survival by maintaining starvation-induced autophagy. Signaling via α3β1 to Erk through EGFR or through Src is also required for cell survival. The PI-3K/Akt pathway is not activated on LM5 and not required for survival. Disruption of either the EGFR/Erk or Src pathway leads to caspase-independent cell death, due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas disruption of autophagy leads to caspase activation and death.</div></div>
