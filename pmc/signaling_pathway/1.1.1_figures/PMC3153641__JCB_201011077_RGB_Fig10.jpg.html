From: FGF and retinoic acid activity gradients control the timing of neural crest cell emigration in the trunk. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Signaling pathways involved in the control of NCC specification and emigration during trunk elongation.</b> The FGF signaling (pink), acting through the MAPK pathway, prevents the onset of NCC (green) specification in the caudal neural tube and, through the regulation of Wnt1 onset of expression (pale red) and Noggin (orange) expression, controls the initiation of NCC emigration. The RA signaling (blue) controls the initiation of NCC emigration by modulating NCC genes (dashed arrow) or by controlling the onset of Wnt1 expression. The BMP signaling gradient (pale green) promotes the onset and maintenance of NCC emigration through the control of Wnt1 expression (gray lines; data from Burstyn-Cohen et al., 2004).</div></div>
