(A) Representation of the mTOR signaling KEGG pathway, significantly associated with translationally regulated genes. The translationally upregulated genes are shown in red and the translationally downregulated genes in green. The direction of transcriptional regulation (P &lt; 0.05, fold change &gt; 2) is indicated by arrows beside the gene names. (B) Representation of the network of interactions between the translationally regulated proteins related to translation (obtained with Cytoscape and the MiMI plugin). As for the KEGG pathway, the translationally upregulated genes are shown in red and the translationally downregulated genes in green, and potential transcriptional regulations are indicated by arrows beside the circles.</div></div>
