IL-7 transcriptionally increases CD8α expression to promote TCR-self peptide-MHC engagement, but TCR and IL-7R signals both impair IL-7R signaling. <b>(b)</b> The predicted effects of coreceptor tuning are shown by plotting how TCR and IL-7 signals would be expected to vary as a function of TCR input signal strength (‘affinity’ for spMHC) with constant IL-7 input signal, either with or without coreceptor tuning. In the absence of tuning, total signal strength increases with the TCR input signal, whereas coreceptor tuning dampens the TCR signaling induced by high ‘affinity’ ligands, which in turn increases the sensitivity of the IL-7 signaling pathway.</div></div>
