Schematic diagram showing the mechanism by which uPA/uPAR shRNA inhibits angiogenesis in glioblastoma cells and xenografts.  From: uPA and uPAR shRNA Inhibit Angiogenesis via Enhanced Secretion of SVEGFR1 Independent of GM-CSF but Dependent on TIMP-1 in Endothelial and Glioblastoma Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Panel (A) Binding of uPA to uPAR coordinates with GM-CSF receptor to activate JAK2/STAT5 mediated angiogenic signaling pathway. VEGF/VEGFR signaling is also well known to initiate angiogenesis. Panel (B) Knockdown of uPA and uPAR inhibits the angiogenesis signaling induced by both GM-CSF and VEGF. uPA/uPAR down regulation decreased GM-CSF secretion resulting in inhibition of JAK2/STAT5 activation. Further knock down of uPA/uPAR increased sVEGFR1 secretion which binds to free bound VEGF and acts as a scavenger inhibiting VEGF mediated signaling. sVEGFR1 secretion was mediated by TIMP-1 and ectodomain shedding of VEGFR1 regulated by phosphorylation at the Tyr1213 of the VEGFR1 receptor.</div></div>
