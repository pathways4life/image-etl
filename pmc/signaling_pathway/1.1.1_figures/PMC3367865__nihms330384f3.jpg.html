From: Molecular Biology of Lung Cancer: Clinical Implications. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The RAS proto-oncogene family (KRAS, HRAS, NRAS and RRAS) encode four highly homologous 21kDa membrane-bound proteins involved in signal transduction. Proteins encoded by the RAS genes exist in two states: an active state, in which GTP is bound to the molecule and an inactive state, where the GTP has been cleaved to GDP383. Activating point mutations can confer oncogenic potential through a loss of intrinsic GTPase activity resulting in an inability to cleave GTP to GDP. This can initiate unchecked cell proliferation through the RAS/RAF/MEK/MAPK pathway, downstream of the EGFR signaling pathway384. Ras signaling also activates the PI3K/AKT pathway (leading to cell growth, proliferation, and survival), RalGDS and RASSF1. Adapted from12,385.</div></div>
