The NetSlim home page has options to browse the pathway maps. A description of the criteria used for NetSlim is available as a separate tab. Choosing a pathway such as the TGF beta signaling pathway, the ‘Pathway map’ tab provides access to the TGF-β NetSlim pathway map image and the ‘Description’ tab which has a brief description of the pathway. The ‘map with citation’ provided in the NetSlim pathway page contains molecules linked to specific NetPath molecule pages and their reactions linked to their corresponding citations. NetSlim maps can be downloaded in different file formats from specific pathway pages. The NetSlim data is also available to download in BioPAX, PSI-MI and SBML formats. A ‘Feedback’ page allows users to provide comments about the NetSlim resource. A link to NetSlim is provided on each pathway page in NetPath and vice versa.</div></div>
