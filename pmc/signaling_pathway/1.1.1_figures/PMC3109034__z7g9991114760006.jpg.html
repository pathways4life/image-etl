From: Coordinated Regulation of Extracellular Matrix Synthesis by the MicroRNA-29 Family in the Trabecular Meshwork. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Working model for the role of the miR-29 family in TGF-β2–mediated signaling. TGF-β2 stimulation activates SMAD3 signaling, which is necessary for both miR-29b expression and ECM induction by TGF-β2. Concurrently, TGF-β2 suppresses miR-29b levels by an unidentified molecular pathway dominant over that mediated by SMAD3 signaling. TGF-β2 stimulation also results in the induction of miR-29a expression. Together, the miR-29 family functions as an important modulator of ECM synthesis by TGF-β2.</div></div>
