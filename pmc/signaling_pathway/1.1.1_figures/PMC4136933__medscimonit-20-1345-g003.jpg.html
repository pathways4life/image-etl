Hypertrophic 3T3-L1 cells were treated with apelin-13 (100 nM) for 24 h and pretreated with a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (10 μM), for 30 min. (<b>A</b>) AQP7 protein levels were determined by Western blot. β-actin was used as an internal control. (<b>B</b>) Cytoplasmic TG content. Results are expressed as means ±SEM from 3 or 4 independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. * P&lt;0.05 vs. the control group (both apelin-13 + LY294002 non-treated); # P&lt;0.05 apelin-13 + LY294002 vs. apelin-13.</div></div>
