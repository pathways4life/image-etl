From: Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition Promotes Breast Cancer Progression via a Fibronectin-dependent STAT3 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>STAT3 pathway switching is induced by EMT during breast cancer progression.</b> Early-stage BCs utilize SRC-dependent EGFR signaling to drive STAT3 activation and primary tumor growth. Although EGFR is capable of activating STAT3 downstream of FN engagement, the growth factor-stimulated pathway appears to be the prominent mode in pre-EMT cells. Late-stage BCs that have acquired EMT phenotypes utilize Î²1 integrin receptors to engage the ECM containing aberrant levels of FN thereby activating a FAK/PYK2:JAK2:STAT3 signaling cascade. This pathway may be clinically relevant at the metastatic tumor site and likely contributes to the resistance of BC to EGFR targeted therapies. Targets for pharmacological and immunological inhibitors used in this study are also highlighted.</div></div>
