However, this newly-described insulin signaling pathway, which is independent of aldosterone, increases phosphorylation of Akt through PI3K and activates the WNK-OSR1/SPAK-NCC phosphorylation cascade. As a result, phosphorylation of NCC in hyperinsulinemic mice fed a high-salt diet is not down-regulated effectively (right panel).</div></div>
