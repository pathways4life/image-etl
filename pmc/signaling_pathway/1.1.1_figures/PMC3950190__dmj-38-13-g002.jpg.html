The effects of multiple studies examining the effects of EDCs on the glucocorticoid signaling pathway are summarized, including effects at various concentrations and in different model systems. As such, these studies should not be interpreted to mean that each EDCs operates similarly in all tissues; however, pooling of the data suggests potential mechanisms of synergy among various EDCs that modulate activity of this signaling pathway. 11β-HSD, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; BPA, bisphenol A; PCB, polychlorinated biphenyl; GR-GRE, glucocorticoid receptor-glucocorticoid response element.</div></div>
