(A) The luciferase reporter assay using TopFlash and FopFlash vectors was utilized to study β-catenin TCF/LEF promoter activity. The TopFlash reporter vector has 6-TCF binding sites, while FopFlash has mutated TCF binding sites. SGC7901 and U251 cells were co-transfected with different expression vectors as indicated. MiR-200a mimic treatment decreased β-catenin TCF/LEF promoter activity. (B) Up-regulation of miR-200a decreased β-catenin and TCF-4 expression. (C) Immunofluorescence assay for β-catenin indicates that the location of β-catenin in cells shifts from nuclear to cytoplasmic when the expression of miR-200a was increased, and that TCF-4 expression decreased in the nucleus compared to control vector.</div></div>
