The active kinase generates PIP3 at the lipid membrane. PIP3 facilitates the phosphorylation of Akt by PDK1, while the mTOR-rictor complex contributes a second phosphate residue to Akt. As the central effector of the PI3K pathway, Akt transmits signal to a host of downstream substrates, thus influencing a variety of key cellular functions. Pathway activity is negatively regulated by PTEN and the S6K-IRS1 feedback loop. Pharmacological inhibition of the pathway is achieved through a variety of compounds in clinical use at various points along the pathway that are indicated by the red ‚ä£.</div></div>
