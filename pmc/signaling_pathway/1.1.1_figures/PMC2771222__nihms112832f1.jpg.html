From: Lack of evidence for activation of the Hedgehog <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> in psoriasis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Recent reports have suggested that the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is activated in lesional psoriatic skin (Kuenzli et al, 2004; Tas and Avci, 2004; Endo et al, 2006; Meth and Weinberg, 2006), and that pharmacological inhibition of this pathway using cyclopamine may lead to rapid resolution of the disease (Kuenzli et al, 2004; Tas and Avci, 2004; Meth and Weinberg, 2006). The Hh signaling pathway is one of the major signaling pathways involved in embryonic development (Ingham and Placzek, 2006). During physiologic Hh signaling, Hh proteins bind to the cell surface receptor Patched (PTCH1), thereby releasing Smoothened (SMO) from PTCH-mediated inhibition. SMO activation then triggers a series of intracellular events, culminating in alterations in gene expression mediated by the Gli family of transcription factors (GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3) (Ruiz i Altaba et al, 2007) (Figure 1). The transcripts for PTCH1 and GLI1 are reliable markers for both physiologic and pathologic Hh signaling activity as they are consistently induced when the Hh pathway is activated (McMahon et al, 2003; Hutchin et al, 2005). This pathway has been shown to be a crucial regulator of hair follicle growth and sebaceous gland biology (Allen et al, 2003; Niemann et al, 2003). On the other hand, sustained activation of the Hh pathway appears to be the driving force for BCC development (Daya-Grosjean and Couve-Privat, 2005).</div></div>
