From: The hnRNP-Q Protein LIF2 Participates in the Plant Immune Response. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Expression levels of genes involved in the JA-dependent signaling pathway (LOX3, AOS, AOC, OPR3, COI1, and JAR1) and of a JA-responsive marker gene (PDF1.2) in the rosette leaves of seven-week-old wild-type (WT) and lif2-1 plants. (B) Expression levels of genes of the SA-dependent signaling pathway (EDS1, PAD4, and ICS1) and of SA-responsive marker genes (NPR1 and PR1) in seven-week-old wild-type (WT) and lif2-1 rosette leaves. CC-NB-LRR and TIR-NB-LRR are disease resistance proteins with coiled-coil (CC), nucleotide-binding (NB), leucine-rich repeat (LRR), or Toll-Interleukin Receptor (TIR) domains. (C) Quantification of phytohormone contents in the rosette leaves of three-week-old plants using HPLC-electrospray-MS/MS. The amount of JA was expressed as a ratio of peak areas (209&gt;62/214&gt;62) per fresh weight (FW). The amount of other hormones was expressed in ng/FW. The bars represent standard deviation.</div></div>
