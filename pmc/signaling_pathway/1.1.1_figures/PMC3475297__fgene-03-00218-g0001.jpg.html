From: Regulation of lifespan by chemosensory and thermosensory systems: findings in invertebrates and their implications in mammalian aging. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>C. elegans and D. melanogaster sensory systems influence lifespan. (A)</b> C. elegans chemosensory and thermosensory systems regulate lifespan through hormonal signaling. Specific chemosensory (olfactory or gustatory) neurons promote or limit longevity. Insulin/IGF-1 signaling can mediate this longevity response downstream of chemosensory neurons. Perturbation of thermosensory system accelerates aging at high temperatures by influencing the sterol hormonal signaling pathway. <b>(B)</b> Chemosensory systems regulate D. melanogaster lifespan. Olfaction of nutrient-derived odorants promotes the aging of long-lived D. melanogaster upon dietary restriction (DR). Perturbation of the D. melanogaster olfactory system and inhibition of the CO2-sensing system both prolong lifespan. However, the signaling pathways regulated by D. melanogaster chemosensory systems to influence lifespan are unknown.</div></div>
