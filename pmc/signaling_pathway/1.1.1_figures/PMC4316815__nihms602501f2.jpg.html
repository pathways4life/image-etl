From: Zinc and the ERK Kinases in the Developing Brain. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Regulation by zinc of the ERK1/2 signaling cascade. Zinc could activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway at various levels: 1 zinc inhibits phosphatases that are involved in ERK1/2 dephosphorylation, and zinc inhibits kinases that indirectly regulate the phosphorylation levels of receptors that subsequently activate the ERK cascade; 2 zinc can directly bind to and activate receptors (e.g., GPR39) which have ERK1/2 as a downstream signaling cascade; and 3 zinc can activate MMPs, which subsequently cleave and activate substrates (e.g., pro-BDNF) releasing ligands (e.g. BDNF) that activate receptors upstream from the ERK1/2 cascade</div></div>
