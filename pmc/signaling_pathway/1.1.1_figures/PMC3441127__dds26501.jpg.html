(<b>A</b>) Representation of genes in the MAP kinase signaling pathway (MAPK signaling pathway) identified by the KEGG visual pathway resource, which includes the ERK1/2 (ERK signaling), JNK (JNK signaling) and p38α (p38 signaling) branches within this GO term. Genes with statistically significant differences (q&lt; 0.05) in expression detected on Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays in hearts of LmnaH222P/H222P mice compared with wild-type mice are indicated by asterisks; red asterisks indicate genes in the p38α branch. (<b>B</b>) Matrices showing array data of corresponding probe sets corresponding to 10 genes in the in the p38α branch with statistically significant differences (q&lt; 0.05) in expression between wild-type (Lmna+/+) and LmnaH222P/H222P mouse hearts. In the matrices, each probe set is visualized as a row of colored squares and each column is a biological replicate (sample form a different mouse heart). Darker color means lower expression and brighter color higher expression. The genes correspond to those indicated with red asterisks in (A) [DDIT3/CHOP10 is the same as GADD153 and MAP2K6/MEK6 the same as MKK6 in (A)]. (<b>C</b>) Validation of differential expression in hearts from LmnaH222P/H222P mice of four selected genes in the p38α MAP signaling pathway using real-time quantitative RT–PCR. RNA was obtained from hearts of mice at different ages as indicated on the x-axis. White bars show relative RNA expression levels in hearts of Lmna+/+ mice and black bars in hearts of LmnaH222P/H222P mice. Values are means ± SEM for n= 3 samples per group. The real-time quantitative RT–PCR was performed in triplicate with the different RNA samples. *P&lt; 0.05, **P&lt; 0.005, ***P&lt; 0.0005.</div></div>
