From: Apoptosis and antigen receptor function in T and B cells following exposure to herpes simplex virus. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Jurkat cells were infected with HSV-2 HG52 for 6 h prior to analysis. Cells were stained simultaneously with indo-1 and annexin V for detection of calcium flux in apoptotic and non-apoptotic populations. (A) Annexin V stain shows both apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells at 6 h p.i. (B) Apoptotic and non-apoptotic populations were gated individually and assessed for the ability mobilize calcium by flow cytometric analysis. (C) Both populations demonstrate inhibition of TCR signaling pathway as shown by the small percentages of cells (upper right quadrants) able to mobilize calcium following OKT-3 stimulations (vertical arrows).</div></div>
