In normal cells, multiple signaling pathways may cooperate to control the cell growth. After the progressive accumulation of mutations, such as oncogenic Ras mutations, the entire Ras/MAPK pathway could become hyperactive, resulting in activation of ELK1 and up-regulated MED23. Therefore, cancer cells with Ras mutations become heavily dependent on the Ras/MAPK/ELK1/MED23 pathway for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Targeting MED23, ELK1, or their interaction may counteract the oncogenic signaling transduction in the Ras-driven cancer cells.</div></div>
