From: A unique herpesviral transcriptional program in KSHV-infected lymphatic endothelial cells leads to mTORC1 activation and rapamycin sensitivity. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The phosphorylation status of relevant signaling pathways was determined by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. (<b>A</b>) Western blots of the substrates of mTORC1 signaling, p70 S6K (that phosphorylates S6) and 4EBP1, in mock and stably infected (inf) LEC and BEC were performed. (<b>B</b>) The MAPK pathway (MEK/ERK/RSK) and PI3K/AKT pathway converge at TSC2 to regulate mTORC1 signaling. (<b>C</b>) PI3K/AKT signaling to TSC2 T1462 shows no contribution to the mTORC1 activation in LEC.219. (<b>D</b>) ERK2/RSK1 signals to TSC2 S1798 in LEC.219 without any contribution from upstream MEK1/2. See also Figure S3.</div></div>
