From: The Blood Transcriptional Signature of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Is Consistent with an Ongoing Interferon-Mediated Antiviral Response. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The upregulated HCV gene signature is enriched for interferon (IFN) pathway genes. Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to find significantly enriched pathways and networks among the genes that were upregulated in chronic HCV infection. <b>(a)</b> The IFN pathway was found to be significantly enriched (P&lt;0.0001), with several signature genes (shaded) occurring downstream of Jak-Stat signaling. <b>(b)</b> Many direct (solid arrow) and indirect (dashed arrow) interactions were identified among the signature genes (shaded), and others related to the IFN response.</div></div>
