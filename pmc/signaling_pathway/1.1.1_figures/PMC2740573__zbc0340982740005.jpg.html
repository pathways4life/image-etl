From: Proteolytic Cascade for the Activation of the Insect Toll <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Induced by the Fungal Cell Wall Component. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>A model of the serine proteases cascades regulating the Toll pathway in Tenebrio.</b> When the β-1,3-glucan of fungi is exposed to the insect, Tenebrio GNBP3 binds to β-1,3-glucan and then recruits pro-MSP. In the presence of Ca2+, the β-1,3-glucan/GNBP3 complex induces activation of pro-MSP to activated MSP (aMSP). The aMSP converts pro-SAE to activated SAE (aSAE), which subsequently converts the pro-SPE to activated SPE (aSPE). The aSPE cleaves pro-Spätzle to processed Spätzle leading to the production of AMPs such as Tenecin 1 and Tenecin 2 via the Toll receptor. The Lys-type PG-dependent Tenebrio Toll signaling pathway was previously reported by our group (26).</div></div>
