By                             means of MatInspector, [33] gene promoters in the Notch pathway were                             found to contain at least one putative LEF-1/TCF-site (number of sites                             in per gene is described in square brackets). Genes in gray boxes were                             subjected for further semi quantitative RT-PCR analysis.</div></div>
