The pointed arrows represent activation of substrates, while blunt arrows represent inhibition. Activation of membrane kinases, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), by external growth factors can initiate activation of intracellular signaling pathways. AKT is phosphorylated downstream of PI3K with various effects, including the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR phosphorylates p70S6 and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP-1), which then leads to an increased translation of mRNA that encodes several cell cycle regulators. These effects are controlled by the tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)-TSC2 complex. The Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK pathway has its own distinct downstream effects, but also converges with the PI3K-AKT pathway. Future combination regimens involving targeted agents against this signaling network include the concomitant or sequential blockade of these pathways. PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.</div></div>
