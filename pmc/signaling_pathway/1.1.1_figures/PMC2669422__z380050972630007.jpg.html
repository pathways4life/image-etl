IPA reveals canonical pathways enriched in dysregulated genes in VILI-challenged groups relative to spontaneously breathing WT control lungs. Dashed line represents threshold level for significance (1.3, negative log of P value 0.05 by Fisher’s exact test). The B-cell receptor signaling pathway exhibited the greatest dysregulation in the VILI-exposed GADD45a−/− group, with components that include members of the PI3K/Akt pathway.</div></div>
