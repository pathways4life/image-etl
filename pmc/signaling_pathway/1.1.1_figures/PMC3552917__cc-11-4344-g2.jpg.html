Illustrated are the major components of each of the Notch, WNT, HH and BMP pathways, starting with ligands expressed by the signaling cell, receptors expressed on the receiving cell and cytoplasmic signaling intermediates and transcriptional effectors. In this illustration, signal transduction for each pathway travels from the top of the figure to the bottom.</div></div>
