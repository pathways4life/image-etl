The interaction of LPS with TLR-4 that requires cooperation of two other proteins, CD14 and MD-2, initiates two major signaling pathways. The MyD88-dependent signaling pathway leads to the phosphorylation of IRAK, recruitment of TRAF-6, activation of NF-κB and JNK/p38, and release of proinflammatory cytokines. Another adapter, Mal/Tirap, participates in this pathway. The study of McWhirter et al. (5) focuses on the activation of the MyD88-independent pathway that results in the activation of IRF-3 and the induction of IFN-β and Rantes. TRIF and TRAM serve as adapter proteins in TLR-4 signaling that leads to activation of IRF-3. Association of TRIF with the noncanonic kinase TBK-1 results in a complex formation also containing IRF-3. Phosphorylated IRF-3 is translocated to the nucleus and stimulates expression of type I IFN and chemokine genes. The ligand for TLR-3 is dsRNA, viral RNA, or its surrogate poly(IC). TLR-3 does not associate with Mal TRAM and MyD88, and thus TRIF alone can mediate the dsRNA-induced signaling pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and the induction of IFN-β.</div></div>
