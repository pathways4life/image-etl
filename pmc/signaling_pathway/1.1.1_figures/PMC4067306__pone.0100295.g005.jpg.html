The overlap of the top-ranking overexpressed genes with the specific signaling pathways is quantified from top 100 to top 600. Grey curves show random expectations with respect to the number of genes in a specific pathway. Robust systematic differences between the different types of gliomas are clearly visible.</div></div>
