The Gαs/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway has classically been considered as the key signaling mechanism triggered at the FSHR. Over the last decade, mounting evidence have shown that FSHR also engages other transduction mechanisms mainly coupling to other Gα subunits, β-arrestin-dependent signaling, EGFR transactivation, and APPL1-mediated signals. Bibliographic references are indicated on the map by the first author’s name with two digits for the year of publication. The CellDesigner program has been used to represent signaling pathways as shown in Figures 1–7. Complexes are surrounded by a box. Dashed lines indicate indirect reactions. The following semantic has been used: proteins (); active protein (); receptor (); transcript (); gene (); catalysis (); association (); dissociation (); inhibition (); phosphorylation (); degradation (); known transition omitted (); unknown transition ().</div></div>
