Binding of Hh results in activation of Smo, which then modulates Gli transcription factors to initiate transcription of Hh target genes. Proteins involved in modulating signal relay between Smo and Gli are as indicated. Pathway suppressors are indicated in red and activators in green color. The molecules in this pathway that are targets for chemical inhibitors include Smo and Gli.</div></div>
