In this model, E2 binds to the ER, resulting in PKCα activation, which in turn promotes ERK1/2 activation and proliferation in leiomyoma cells. Likewise, E2 binds to the ER in normal UtSM-ht cells to activate PKCα in normal UtSM-ht cells. However, activated PKCα promotes cAMP-PKA signaling, which in turn inhibits ERK1/2 activation, E2-dependent genomic response, and proliferation in normal uterine smooth muscle. RTK, Receptor: tyrosine kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase.</div></div>
