Hypothetical network showing the metabolic pathways affecting steroidogenesis and androstenone biosynthesis..  From: <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> Based Analysis of Genes and Interactions Influencing Porcine Testis Samples from Boars with Divergent Androstenone Content in Back Fat. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Legend: Interactions inside each pathway shows the significant interactions from analysis with genes as nodes and significant KEGG pathway interactions as edges. Blue diamond nodes: pathways that might be involved in steroidogenesis, but not found in results. Cyan colored nodes: chemical compound or molecules synthesized in pathways. Purple node: external stimulus in the form of hormone signaling. Grey solid edges: hypothetical interactions based on information from literature. Very light blue circular nodes: genes involved in significant interactions. Red dashed edges: interactions positive and significant in HA samples, positive in LA samples. Orange solid edges: interactions positive in HA samples, negative and significant in LA samples. Orange dashed edges: interactions negative in HA samples, negative and significant in LA samples. Dark green solid edges: interactions positive and significant in LA samples, negative in HA samples. Dark green dashed edges: interactions positive and significant in LA samples, positive in HA samples. Light green solid edges: interactions positive in LA samples, negative and significant in HA samples. Light green dashed edges: interactions negative in LA samples, negative and significant in HA samples. In HA animals, steroid synthesis and androstenone synthesis might be activated by cAMP-PKC signaling and further boosted by de novo cholesterol synthesis by virtue of an active fatty acid metabolism pathway and anti lipid peroxidation activity of members of glutathione metabolism pathway. In LA animals steroid hormone synthesis and androstenone synthesis could have been affected by weak cAMP-PKA signaling and inhibition of steroidogenesis by ceramides synthesized from sphingolipid metabolic pathway.</div></div>
