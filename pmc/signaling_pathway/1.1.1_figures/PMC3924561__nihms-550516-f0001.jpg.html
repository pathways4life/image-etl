From: Functional Relevance of Biased <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> at the Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(<b>A</b>) Ang II-mediated stimulation of AT1R leads to the activation of both Gαq protein- and β-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways, each of which can induce protein synthesis through the activation of the ERK1/2-Mnk1-eIF4E pathway, though it is not known if the effects of each pathway are equivalent. Sequestration of ERK1/2 in the cytosol by β-arrestins prevents nuclear targeting and effects on gene expression and promotes anti-apoptotic signaling via p90RSK regulation of intracellular BAD targeting. β-arrestins 1 and 2 each interact with a number of proteins involved in receptor internalization, including c-Src, AP-2 and ARNO, which promote AT1R endocytosis following stimulation. Interaction with AIP4 promotes ubiquitination of TRPV4, a nonselective cation channel, promoting its internalization in conjunction with AT1R. A possible β-arrestin-Gaf-1-Rab11 complex may promote trafficking of internalized AT1R to the plasma membrane. (<b>B</b>) AT1R stimulation mediates hypertrophy via distinct mechanisms including transactivation of EGFR via either Gαq protein- or β-arrestin-mediated activation of the c-Src-MMP-HB-EGF shedding pathway, as well as Gαq protein-mediated activation of PKC signaling. Each signaling pathway results in ERK1/2 activation and an increase in hypertrophy, though the relative contributions of each pathway to the hypertrophic response in different cell types and pathological states, and whether they are equivalent responses, is unknown. (<b>C</b>) Activation of AT1R leads to Gαq protein-mediated increases in contractility via modulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels and PKC signaling. AT1R-β-arrestin-mediated signaling leads to activation of RhoA and ROCK, which subsequently contributes to stress fiber reorganization and membrane blebbing in HEK 293 cells. Whether these processes mediate contractility is not yet known. β-arrestins 1 and 2 each interact with a number of other proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation, including actin, cofilin, PP2A and slingshot, which though coordinated action can lead to actin depolymerization and possible effects on contractility following AT1R stimulation.</div></div>
