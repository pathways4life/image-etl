Wnt binds to the Lrp5 or 6 and Frizzled coreceptor complex which leads to the intracellular accumulation of β-catenin. β-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it binds to TCF/Lef transcription factors and regulates the expression of a number of target genes. Mutations in several components of the pathway have been shown to result in disease. Mutations in LRP5 can result in diseases of increased or decreased bone mass and vision problems. The Lrp5 receptor and Wnt pathway may also play a key role in aortic valve calcification. Mutations in APC, β-catenin and Axin have been shown to give rise to a number of different types of cancer. Downstream gene targets of β-catenin such as osteoprotegerin (OPG) and the secreted frizzled related proteins (sFRPs) are known to regulate osteoclastogenesis and may play a role in metastatic bone diseases that result in osteolytic lesions. Mutations in modulators of Wnt signaling such as the SOST gene, which produces sclerostin, give rise to the increased bone mass disease, sclerosteosis. These are just a few examples of the variety of diseases that have been attributed to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.</div></div>
