Chart explaining the function of HaCal in the cross talk between 20E and JH pathways..  From: The Participation of Calponin in the Cross Talk between 20-Hydroxyecdysone and Juvenile Hormone <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways by Phosphorylation Variation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A, 20E pathway: 20E signaling leads HaCal protein phosphorylation by PKC via an unknown membrane pathway (<b>1</b>), HaCal is translocated into the nuclei (<b>2</b>), phosphorylated HaCal does not bind with phosphorylated USP1 in 20E pathway (<b>3</b>). EcR binds 20E and USP [52], [53] and other chaperone protein to form transcription complex, combine the 20E response element initiating the gene transcription [3], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57]. B, JH pathway: Methoprene maintains HaCal non-phosphorylation and translocates HaCal into the nuclei (<b>1</b>), non-phosphorylated HaCal binds with non-phosphorylated USP1 (<b>2</b>). Met binds JH [20], [58], [59] and interacts with USP and other chaperone proteins [20], [58], and then this complex binds JH response element via Met to initiate JH signaling pathway [59].</div></div>
