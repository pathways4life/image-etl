From: <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> and transcriptional regulation in osteoblast commitment and differentiation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Six important signaling networks of osteoblast differentiation. Binding of Wnt to the FZD receptor induces ÃŸ-catenin accumulation, which translocates to the nucleus to activate target gene transcription. Several transcription factors have been found crucial for osteoblast differentiation downstream of this signaling pathway, such as Runx2, Osterix, and ATF4. They are essential for differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into differentiated osteoblasts and also function in the transcription of osteoclast-specific genes. The dotted lines indicate that the physiological function or the stage at which the factor mainly works remains to be proven.</div></div>
