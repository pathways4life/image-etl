The percent overlap between signature genes between all pairs of pathways is displayed as a heat map with higher overlap suggesting greater crosstalk between the respective signaling pathways. Pathway similarity is calculated as the negative log of the percent overlap and similar pathways are grouped using hierarchical clustering. Two major clusters are realized, separating pathways involved in immune response (JAK-STAT, TLR, IL-1 and TNF-Î±) from pathways controlling cell cycle.</div></div>
