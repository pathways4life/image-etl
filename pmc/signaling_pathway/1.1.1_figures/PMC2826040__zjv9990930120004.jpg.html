(Top) Type I interferon signaling pathway comprised of miR-200a targets; (bottom) expression changes of miR-200a and its targets associated with the type I interferon pathway in r1918-infected samples. Red represents microRNA or targets that have increased expression in r1918-infected samples, relative to Tx/91-infected samples. Green represents microRNA or targets that have decreased expression in r1918-infected samples, relative to Tx/91-infected samples.</div></div>
