From: NSPc1 is a cell growth regulator that acts as a transcriptional repressor of p21Waf1/Cip1 via the RARE element. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A regulation model of NSPc1/RA receptors in the p21 pathway. (<b>a</b>) Regulatory model: NSPc1 represses p21 expression via RARE element. Note, NSPc1 needs co-binding factor (CoB) to facilitate its localization on RARE element. (<b>b</b>) When the RA signaling pathway is activated, RXRs/RARs compete with NSPc1 for binding RARE element on the p21 promoter, and then transcription is activated. (<b>c</b>) Signal pathway model shows connections between NSPc1, RA and p21 pathways.</div></div>
