From: BMP <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> regulates sympathetic nervous system development through  Smad4-dependent and -independent pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>The roles of BMP signaling pathways during SNS development.</b> Both  Smad4-dependent and -independent pathways are involved in SNS development. The  Smad4-independent pathway activates the paired homeobox factor Phox2b, which  regulates the survival of precursors and the expressions of bHLH factor Hand2  and zinc finger factor Gata3. The Smad4-dependent pathway is not required for  Ascl1 gene activation but is required for continued expression. Ascl1  regulates proliferation of neuroblasts but not their noradrenergic  differentiation. Both pathways converge to regulate noradrenergic  differentiation of sympathetic neurons.</div></div>
