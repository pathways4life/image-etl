Differentially expressed transcripts were subjected to bioinformatics analysis using IPA 7.6. <b>A</b>) Most significantly enriched groups relating to molecular and cellular functions. <b>B</b>) Most significantly enriched canonical signaling pathways. The total number of genes in a pathway is boldfaced. For each pathway, the percentage of genes that are of decreased (green) or increased (red) transcript abundance is indicated at the top. Portions of pathway genes that are not significantly changed are also shown (white). The yellow square for each pathway indicates â€“log(P value). The yellow arrow indicates P = 0.05.</div></div>
