During normoxia (white area), activity of NOS presumably generates a pool of NO, possibly nitrite, which is stored in the mitochondria. During shortfalls of oxygen (hypoxia, shaded area), this pool gets converted back to NO. NO is present in the cytoplasm as GSNO. In the cytoplasm, generation of cGMP through sGC subsequently activates cGMP-dependent channels, resulting in mobilization of calcium through these channels. The two most novel steps in this proposed pathway are the production of NO by mitochondrial reduction and the activation of sGC by GSNO. The reductive production of NO by the mitochondrial has been documented in other contexts (Kozlov et al., 1999; Nohl et al., 2000). The activation of sGC by GSNO is suggested by our data and a recently recognized diversity in the mechanisms regulating sGCs leads us to suggest an activating input by transnitrosylation (see Discussion). Activation of this signaling pathway may allow adaptation to conditions of hypoxia. The signaling pathway as delineated in this article was defined by our data using S2 cells.</div></div>
