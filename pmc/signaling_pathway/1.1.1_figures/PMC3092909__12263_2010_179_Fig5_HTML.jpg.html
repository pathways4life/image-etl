Signal transduction through β1-integrins leads to the activation of the Ras-MAP Kinase signaling pathway. Activation of the MAPK pathway may be one of the mechanisms by which β1-integrins regulate chondrocyte gene expression. Previous studies have shown that activation of the MAPK pathway regulates the activity of a number of intracellular signaling proteins through phosphorylation. Erk1/Erk2, a downstream kinase of the MAPK pathway, regulates the expression and activity of various transcription factors. Specific inhibition of Erk1/Erk2 by U0126 or IL-1β results in cleavage of caspase-3 in human chondrocytes in vitro. Since activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation are common features of apoptosis, the specific inhibition of the Ras-mitogen-activated kinase leads to chondrocyte apoptosis. Resveratrol and curcumin both block the inhibition effect of U0126 or IL-1β on the MAPK pathway in chondrocytes</div></div>
