Normalized proportion of negative genetic interactions within one KEGG <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>..  From: Synthetic Lethality between Gene Defects Affecting a Single Non-essential Molecular <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> with Reversible Steps. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The proportion is related to the number of all possible pairwise interactions S(S−1)/2, where S is the size of the KEGG pathway. Negative interactions between components of a molecular complex were excluded (compare the fourth and the fifth columns). We counted the normalized number of negative genetic interactions within one pathway using recent data on the genome-wide screening of genetic interactions in yeast from [5], using the most stringent filter on the epistasis measure ε. Definitions of yeast signaling and metabolic pathways were taken from KEGG database [30]. Only KEGG pathways with a normalized proportion of ≥1% are shown. DNA repair KEGG pathways are highlighted in bold.</div></div>
