BMP-6 and GnRH mutually augment FSHβ transcription in LβT2 cells. GnRH activates FSHβ transcription by activating the ERK pathway, which is negatively regulated by BMP-7. GnRH also provides a feedback inhibition of BMP-Smad signaling by suppressing Smad1/5/8, in part via increasing Smad6/7 expression, and reducing endogenous BMP-7 expression. There is a functional link between GnRH action and the BMP system for regulating FSHβ transcription in gonadotrope cells.</div></div>
