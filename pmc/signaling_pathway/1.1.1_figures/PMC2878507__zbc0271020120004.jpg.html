The cells were harvested 1 day later and lysed. Equal amounts of protein were used for Western blot analysis using either an anti-Myc epitope (top) or anti-tubulin antibody. B, NF-κB reporter activation in the control and transiently transfected cells was measured using a luminometer. The values shown are mean ± S.D. (error bars) of triplicate wells from one representative experiment of three independent experiments.</div></div>
