The nodes are colored according to their sub cellular locations in the cell (Figure 1) and are divided into four regions: Extracellular and Membrane (Blue), Cytoplasm (Red), Nuclear (Green) and Output proteins (Yellow) respectively. The size of the nodes is assigned according to their total number of connections or degree. Total degree of each node is followed by the name of the proteins. The “Bow-Tie” structure of the Hedgehog signaling network is easily visible, where the signals are converging towards GLI1 or GLI2 and diverging to its subsequent steps. The size the node GLI1 is biggest as it has highest number of connections or degree among all other proteins in the network.</div></div>
