Cells were harvested at indicated time points, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. (<b>B</b>) Inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway in 786-O cells with increasing concentrations of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT for 24 hours. Immunoblotting experiments to measure expression levels of the Notch target Hes-1. (<b>C</b>) The effects of L-685458 and DAPT on Hes-1 protein levels in 786-O cells treated for 24 hours compared with DMSO-treated (–) cells. (<b>D</b>) DAPT (+) treatment compared with vehicle control (–) treatment of PRC3 and WT7 cells. Cells were harvested after 24 hours of treatment, and cell lysates were analyzed for Hes-1 protein expression. (<b>E</b>) DAPT (+) treatment compared with vehicle control (–) treatment in a panel of CCRCC cells. Cells were harvested after 24 hours of treatment, and cell lysates were analyzed for Hes-1 protein expression. (<b>F</b>) Hes-1 mRNA levels assessed by Q-PCR in DAPT-treated CCRCC cells. Cells were harvested after 24 hours of treatment. DMSO-treated samples were designated as 100%, and data shown are mean + SD of representative experiment performed in triplicate.                </div></div>
