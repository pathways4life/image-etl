From: Auxin and Ethylene Induce Flavonol Accumulation through Distinct Transcriptional Networks1[C][W][OA]. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Order of signaling events in hormone-induced flavonol metabolism. A combination of auxin- and ethylene-specific and MYB-dependent transcriptional control may explain the observed data. TIR1- and ARF-dependent auxin signaling activates the auxin-responsive elements of the pathway genes shown, which include F3′H. In parallel, MYB12 is activated, leading to further up-regulation of the same pathway genes and PAP1 and TTG1 through their MYB-responsive elements. The line between MYB12 and PAP1 and TTG1 is dotted based on the complexity of interpreting these mutant data, as described in the text. EIN2- and ETR1-dependent ethylene signaling also increases the expression of a subset of pathway genes, excluding F3′H, through the activation of ethylene-responsive elements. This auxin-specific regulation of F3′H may explain the observed differences in the Q/K ratio after treatment with IAA and ACC. [See online article for color version of this figure.]</div></div>
