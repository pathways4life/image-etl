From: Assembling defenses against therapy-resistant leukemic stem cells: Bcl6 joins the ranks. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>PI3K, AKT, FOXO, and BCL6 are key players in Ph+ stem cell survival.</b> Ph+ ALL and CML are dependent on signals emanating from BCR-ABL through the PI3K–AKT pathway that may be driven by TGF-β via inhibition of AKT. BCL6 acts downstream of FOXO TFs and appears to represent a critical missing piece of the signaling pathway that leads to cancer stem cell survival. This signaling cascade offers potential for therapeutic modulation at various levels, including BCR-ABL inhibition by kinase inhibitors, TGFβ inhibition by Ly364947, and Bcl6 inhibition by RI-BPI.</div></div>
