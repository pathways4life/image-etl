For DC development, MP yield the macrophage-DC progenitor (MDP) and common DC progenitor (CDP). In Flt3L-mediated DC development during homeostasis, the CDP yields plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and pre-cDC, the immediate precursors of conventional DC (cDC) and some tissue DC (tDC). Estradiol (E)/ERα signaling decreases the number of DC that develop along this pathway (blue dashed circle). In the GM-CSF-driven pathway, MP give rise to MDP and monocytes that differentiate to populations of inflammatory DC and some tDC. Estradiol/ERα signaling promotes this developmental pathway (red solid circle). LP also yield some DC populations in vivo (not shown). This figure was adapted from (Schmid et al., 2010).</div></div>
