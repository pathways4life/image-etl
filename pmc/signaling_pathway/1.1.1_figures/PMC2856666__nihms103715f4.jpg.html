Protein kinases and phosphatases are denoted as green and red, respectively, while green and red arrows correspond to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation actions, respectively. b) The negative pathway regulators YPD1, PTC1, and NBP2, show strong positive genetic interactions with the pathway activators SSK1, SSK2, SSK22, PBS2, and HOG1. In contrast, genes coding for the protein phosphatases (PTC1, PTC2, PTC3, PTP2, and PTP3) acting on HOG1 show primarily negative genetic interactions among themselves. c) Scatter plot of the correlation coefficients of pbs2Δ and hog1Δ with all genetic profiles in the signaling E-MAP. d) Schematic illustration of the inositol polyphosphate pathway. e) A subset of genetic interactions for PLC1, KCS1, IPK1, and VIP1. In b) and e), negative and positive genetic interactions are indicated by blue or yellow squares, respectively. Gray squares represent genetic interactions not tested.</div></div>
