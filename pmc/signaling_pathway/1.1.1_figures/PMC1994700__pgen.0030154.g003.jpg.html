Systematic Identification and Analysis of Nonswarming Mutants.  From: A Comprehensive Genetic Characterization of Bacterial Motility. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Nonswarming mutants were enriched through twenty rounds of daily successive transfers. Plates imaged after each stage of enrichment show the gradual accumulation of nonswarming mutants at the center of the plates.(B) Distribution of z-scores after enrichment for nonswarming mutants. Not shown is flgD, which has a z-score of 1,350.(C) Images of the wild-type parent strain and chemotaxis mutants on swarm plates.(D) Swarming motility of Δhns and ΔyfiR mutants.(E) Images of swarm plates with LPS and OPG mutants.(F) Images of otherwise nonswarming LPS and OPG mutants with a ΔrcsF mutation.(G) A model summarizing the involvement of Rcs signaling with swimming, swarming, and χ-phage infection. Components of the Rcs signaling pathway are shown in yellow. Mutations in the cellular components highlighted in red were found to impair swimming, swarming, and χ-phage infection by signaling through the Rcs phosphorelay pathway and repressing the expression of the flhDC operon. Black solid arrows denote precursor synthesis or gene expression. Blue dotted arrows denote signaling through the Rcs pathway.</div></div>
