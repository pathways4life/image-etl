Each protein in this subcluster has a coordinate with respect to its order in the 959 members (from left to right); a pathway distribution is generated from the distribution of its members' coordinates under the bandwidth of 10 (R 2.25; IPA 5.5). (b) Distribution of the TGF-β signaling pathway. (c) Distributions of death-receptor and NF-κB signaling pathways. (d) Distributions of B- and T-cell receptor signaling pathways. (e) Distributions of insulin receptor, Fc epsilon RI and natural killer cell signaling pathways.</div></div>
