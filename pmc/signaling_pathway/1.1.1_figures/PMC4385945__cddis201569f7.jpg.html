From: Induction of COX-2-PGE2 synthesis by activation of the MAPK/ERK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> contributes to neuronal death triggered by TDP-43-depleted microglia. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Neuronal death is mediated by the classical MAPK signaling pathway and upregulated PGE2 in TDP-43-depleted microglia. The schematic illustrates the mechanism by which TDP-43-depleted microglia, but not TDP-43-depleted astrocytes, induce neuronal death. The MAPK/ERK signaling pathway is activated in TDP-43-depleted microglia, resulting in increased COX-2 and PGE2, which then trigger neuronal death. Inhibition of COX-2 and PGE2 production using celecoxib alleviates neuronal death mediated by TDP-43-depleted microglia</div></div>
