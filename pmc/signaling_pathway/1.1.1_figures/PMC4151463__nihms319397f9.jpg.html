A working model for ILK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in quiescent and activated hepatic stellate cells.

In quiescent cells, integrins likely have low affinity for extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules (i.e. such as collagen I, fibronectin, etc... - which are in low abundance) and are therefore in a low affinity or inactive confirmation. Thus, ILK is relatively inactive. In addition, the Gα12/13 pathway is inactive (delineated by dotted lines). Upon ligand binding (i.e., collagen I, fibronectin, etc), the confirmation of the integrin changes and ILK binds to the cytoplasmic tail of β-integrin, resulting in formation of PINCH-ILK-parvin ternary complexes. ILK subsequently recruits other signaling molecules. In stellate cells, ILK is engaged in G-protein receptor signaling cross talk, where it appears to amplify Gα12/13 mediated signals. Activation of this ILK/Gα12/13 signaling pathway has several functional consequences, including in actin reorganization (and actin synthesis), cell spreading, cell migration, and extracellular matrix synthesis. The pathways leading to synthesis of ECM are likely to be multiple, and likely include both ILK direct pathways, as well as those that cross talk through the Gα12/13 and the Rho pathway. The activated stellate cell cartoon is meant to depict these both.</div></div>
