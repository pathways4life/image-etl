Color-coding of molecules: activators = yellow, NF-κB subunits = blue, inhibitors = red, degradators = green, nuclear function = cream. Canonical pathway: Binding of extracellular signaling molecules to receptors leads to recruitment of activation proteins, phosphorylation of IKKβ, activation of the IKK complex (IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO), and processing of p105 and p100 into functional p50 and p52 by the ubiquitin ligase SCFβ-TrCP complex. Activated IKK complex phosphorylates IκB, marking it for ubiquitination by the SCFβ-TrCP complex and degradation. The main canonical NF-κB dimer, p65/p50, is activated and translocates to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription with the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex (PIC). Non-canonical pathway: Ligase and receptor coupling leads to NIK and IKKα activation, which initiates processing of p100 into functional p52 by the SCFβ-TrCP complex. The p52/Rel-B dimer translocates to the nucleus to initiate gene expression through the RNA polymerase II PIC</div></div>
