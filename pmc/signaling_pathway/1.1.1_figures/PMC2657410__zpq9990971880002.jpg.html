A molecular interaction map was constructed for major constituents of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and downstream effectors. The genes in the output profile that have established functional relationships to ERK signaling are indicated by gray shading, with the nature of their relationship (i.e., direct phosphorylation, transcriptional activation) indicated by using the symbols described by Pommier and colleagues (43) and shown in the legend.</div></div>
