(A) Schematic representation of the signaling pathway leading to biofilm formation in B. subtilis. The pathway is triggered by activation of the master regulator Spo0A via phosphorylation by KinC. Dashed lines represent indirect activation. (B) Putative metabolic pathway to the formation of distinct polysioprenoids in B. subtilis. Enzymes discussed in the text are written in red, next to the reaction they catalyze. Dashed lines represent unknown steps. (C) Pellicle formation assay to test biofilm formation in different strains of B. subtilis. Positive and negative controls are represented by the wild-type strain (WT) and the matrix-deficient mutant (Δeps ΔyqxM) (Branda et al. 2004, 2006).</div></div>
