For investigating signaling pathways involved in IGF-I mediated COX-2 expression, inhibitors to MAPK/Erk1/2, PI-3K/Akt, P38, or SAPK were studied. The results show that MAPK/Erk is the predominant pathway for mediating IGF-I-induced COX-2 expression in pancreatic cancer cells (bold arrow). HIF-1α is downstream of the IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling cascade, as previously reported (dotted arrow) [7]. However, selective inhibition of HIF-1α using RNAi, decreased constitutive COX-2 expression, but had no effect on inducible COX-2 up-regulation suggesting that other transcription factors are involved in IGF-IR medicated Cox-2 induction. In contrast, PI-3K and SAPK appear to function as negative regulatory pathways for COX-2 expression since selective inhibition leads to increases in constitutive COX-2. The P38 pathway is activated upon stimulation with IGF-I, but inhibition of this protein had no effect of COX-2 expression in pancreatic cancer cells.</div></div>
