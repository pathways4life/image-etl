The majority of fructose-6-phosphate is channeled to glycolysis. Less than 5% of glucose uptake is ultimately channeled to a unique accessory pathway for glucose metabolism, the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This pathway begins with the rate-limiting enzyme, L-glutamine:D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), followed by acetylation of gluocsamine-6-phosphate by glucosamine-6-phosphate acetyltransferase (Emeg32) to N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P). Next are two reversible reactions: the conversion of GlcNAc-6-P to GlcNAc-1-P by phosphate-acetylglucosamine mutase and then the formation uridine diphosphate-GlcNAc (UDP-GlcNAc) by UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase. This high-energy molecule serves as the monosaccharide donor for the post-translational modification by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). O-GlcNAcase (OGA) removes O-GlcNAc modification from proteins.</div></div>
