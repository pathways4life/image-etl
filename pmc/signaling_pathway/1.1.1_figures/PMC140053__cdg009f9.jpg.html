Oxidative stress induces the transcriptional activity of NF-κB by activating the Src–Abl signaling pathway, leading to phosphorylation of PKD at Y463 in the PH domain. Oxidative stress also leads to activation of PKCs, which mediate phosphorylation of the PKD activation-loop residues S738/742 in the catalytic kinase domain. These two events result in a fully-active kinase, which mediates activation of IKKβ and degradation of IκBα, leading to the activation of NF-κB. This pathway contributes to the survival of cells exposed to oxidative stress.</div></div>
