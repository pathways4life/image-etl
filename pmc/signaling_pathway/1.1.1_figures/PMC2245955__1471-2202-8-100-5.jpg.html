Model of Sema3A signaling pathway, colored by GenMAPP to depict under-representation of genes changed during Sema3A exposure, as compared to the number changed during neurite outgrowth in vitro. Criteria for changed genes are the same as for the microarray analysis. Genes on the MAPP include both validated interaction partners from the literature as well as their homologs. Gene names are listed in Additional file 2.</div></div>
