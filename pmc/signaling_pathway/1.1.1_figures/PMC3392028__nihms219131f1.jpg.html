Osteoblasts and chondrocytes are derived from common mesenchymal stem cell precursors. Runx2 stimulates terminal differentiation. A number of transcription factors are involved in Runx2 regulation and function, either upstream of Runx2 or as coactivators or corepressors. Runx2 functions upstream of Osx, which is required after Runx2 for osteoblast differentiation. Ihh and Wnt/Î²-catenin are key signaling molecules in osteoblastogenesis.</div></div>
