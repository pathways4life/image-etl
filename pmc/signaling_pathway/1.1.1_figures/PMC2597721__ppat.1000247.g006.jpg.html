From: Regulated Nuclear Trafficking of rpL10A Mediated by NIK1 Represents a Defense Strategy of Plant Cells against Virus. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Stress-induced oligomerization of the extracellular domain of NIK1 brings the intracellular kinase domains into proximity and allows them to transphosphorylate and activate one another. Upon activation, NIK1 phosphorylates rpL10A, promoting its translocation to the nucleus where it may mount a defense strategy that prevents virus proliferation of spread. Conversely, binding of NSP to the NIK1 kinase domain (A-Loop) inhibits autophosphorylation of NIK1 and, thus, prevents receptor kinase activation and signaling.</div></div>
