From: Clinical Features and Outcome of Patients With IRAK-4 and MyD88 Deficiency. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic representation of TIRs signaling pathway. MyD88 interacts with TLRs and IL-1Rs through a shared TIR domain. MyD88 is a key cytosolic adapter molecule, providing a bridge from TLRs and IL-1Rs to the 2 active kinases IRAK-4 and IRAK-1. IRAK-4 and IRAK-1 then activate at least the 2 signaling NF-kB and MAPK pathways. The MyD88- and IRAK-4-dependent TIR pathway leads among others to the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and to IFN-α/β and IFN-λ, at least for TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9. The MyD88- and IRAK-4-independent TIR pathway uses TRIF pathway after stimulation of TLR3 and TLR4. This pathway is important for IFN-α and IFN-β production.</div></div>
