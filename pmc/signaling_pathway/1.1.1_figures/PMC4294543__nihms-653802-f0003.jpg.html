The Notch signaling pathway has been implicated in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) carcino-genesis. Enhanced expression of NICD occurs in CCA. Several inhibitors of the Notch pathway are currently in development. These include inhibitors of Î³-secretase, a key enzyme in the Notch pathway, as well as monoclonal antibodies (mABs) targeting the Notch receptors and ligands.</div></div>
