Model of inhibition of the JAK2/STAT5 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> by α-Br-TMC..  From: The Synthetic ?-Bromo-2?,3,4,4?-Tetramethoxychalcone (?-Br-TMC) Inhibits the JAK/STAT <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">IL-3 binding to the α/βc chains of the IL-3 receptor leads to activation of the receptor-associated JAK2 tyrosine kinase by trans-phosphorylation. In turn, JAK2-mediated activation of the STAT5, MAPK and AKT pathways via phosphorylation (broad arrows) results in induced transcription of downstream target genes (thin arrows). We showed that α-Br-TMC inhibits JAK2 phosphorylation, hence impairing JAK2-regulated signaling pathways. In addition and independently of JAK2, α-Br-TMC inhibits STAT5 activity. Concomitantly, STAT5A and STAT5B protein mobility in SDS-PAGE is altered, indicating a change in their post-translational modification state induced by α-Br-TMC, which might be associated to STAT5 altered transcriptional activity.</div></div>
