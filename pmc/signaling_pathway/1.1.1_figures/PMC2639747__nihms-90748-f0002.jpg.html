From: Roles of Smad3 in TGF-? <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> During Carcinogenesis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Mechanisms of Smad3 in TGF-β–mediated proapoptotic transcriptional responses. An activated Smad3/4 complex is required in the nucleus to activate the transcription of GADD45 (along with FOXO) and Bim or DAPK and to repress Bcl-2. p38 MAPK is likely involved in the repression of Bcl-2, but the mechanism is not clear. Three mechanisms have been reported for the PI3K/Akt pathway to dampen the proapoptotic signaling of Smad3: Akt can sequester Smad3 in the cytoplasm by the binding of Smad3, activity of Smad3 can be inhibited by mTOR, or Akt may inhibit FOXO by sequestering it from participating in Smad3-mediated transcription of GADD45.</div></div>
