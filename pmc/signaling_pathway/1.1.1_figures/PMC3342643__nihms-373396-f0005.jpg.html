MyD88-dependent pathway is utilized by all TLRs except TLR3 and is initiated by association of MyD88 with the TLRs, followed by subsequent recruitment and activation of IRAKs, TRAF6 and other signaling molecules to the cytoplasm membrane. The pathway leads to activation of IKK and nuclear translocation of NFκB to induce expression of its target genes such as IL-12 and TNFα. The TRIF-dependent pathway is utilized by TLR3 and TLR4 and activates IRF3 (IFN-regulatory factor 3) and transcription of IFNα and co-stimulatory molecules. GSK3α is critical for proinflammatory cytokine production induced by TLRs by promoting NFκB-CBP association. The PI3K-Akt pathway can inhibit TLR-induced proinflammatory cytokine production by phosphorylating and deactivating GSK3α.
