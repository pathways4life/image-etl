A model for the roles of TGFβ and Notch <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways in patterning the early M lineage.

Gray boxes represent cells of the M lineage. We propose that in the dorsal side of the M lineage, the Sma/Mab TGFβ signaling pathway is activated and promotes the SM cell fate. SMA-9 antagonizes this action, resulting in the formation of CCs. LIN-12 activity is restricted to the ventral M-derived cells by the activity of LAG-2, APX-1 and DSL-1, and it also promotes the SM cell fate. Although SMA-9 is present in the ventral cells, it does not antagonize LIN-12 function, due to either the lack of a SMA-9 co-factor(s) or the lack of binding sites in the promoters of LIN-12 target genes. At present, we do not know whether the Sma/Mab TGFβ and the LIN-12/Notch signaling pathways promote the SM fate by activating the SM fate determinant(s) or by activating a repressor(s) of the CC fate determinant(s).</div></div>
