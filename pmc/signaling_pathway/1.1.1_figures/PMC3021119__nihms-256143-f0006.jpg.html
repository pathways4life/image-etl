With the exception of co-expressing sKrn and Upd in the ECs (MyoIAts&gt;Upd + sKrn), all the other ectopic expression experiments were performed using the esgtsF/O driver. Midgut mitotic indices (PH3+) were quantified after activating the transgenes for 2 days. <b>B-J</b>. ISC clonal assay. GFP-marked ISC clones were induced using the MARCM system and analyzed 4 or 8 days later. The sizes of the ISC clones were indicated. Vn-induced ISC proliferation is dependent on Jak/Stat signaling (B-D). Activated Ras (RasV12)-induced ISC proliferation is independent of Jak/Stat signaling (F-G). Some EB clones overexpressing RasV12 underwent extra round of endoreplication (E). Upd-induced ISC proliferation is dependent on EGFR signaling (H-J). <b>K.</b> Quantification of ISC clone sizes. The sizes of ISC clones were measured 4 or 8 days after clone induction (ACI) using the MARCM system. <b>L.</b> RT-qPCR analysis of the induction of Jak/Stat and EGFR signalings by Pe infection in the absence of either pathway (esgtsF/O&gt;Stat or Egfr RNAi).</div></div>
