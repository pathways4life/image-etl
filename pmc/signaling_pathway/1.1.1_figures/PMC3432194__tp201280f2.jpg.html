Network inferred following ECML feature selection and regression-based genetic association interaction network (reGAIN) for the WTCCC GWAS of bipolar disorder, annotated by top enriched pathways. An edge threshold (0.575) was chosen as described in Materials and methods; interactions below this threshold are hidden. The 146 nodes are colored based on membership of the genes in the pathways with evidence of enrichment replication (Tables 1 and 2): red diamond (membership in both Wnt signaling pathway and cadherin signaling pathway), green square (Wnt signaling pathway only) and magenta triangle (Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway). The weight of an edge is proportional to the geneâ€“gene interaction strength. The 183 edges are colored based on connection of a gene node to a gene in the given pathway using the scheme above (red squiggle, green dashed, magenta solid). The size of a node is proportional to its degree (number of edges). Note, ANK3 in the middle is the most connected.</div></div>
