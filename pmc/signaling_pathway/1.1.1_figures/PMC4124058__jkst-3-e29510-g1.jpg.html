Traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, and status epilepticus (SE) injury models have shown that the JAK2-STAT3 pathway becomes activated which is indicated either by the increased phosphorylation of JAK2 and/or STAT3. 1 , 3 , 4 , 10 - 12 , 15 - 23 , 34 - 36  When JAK2-STAT3 becomes phosphorylated it results in the increased expression of STAT3 related genes involved in cell proliferation, 1 , 4 - 6  cellular differentiation, 1 , 4 - 6  cell survival, 1 , 3 - 6 , 15 , 20  and inhibitory neurotransmission. 1 , 10 , 34 </div></div>
