From: GRP94 in ER Quality Control and Stress Responses. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">IGF is both a causative agent and a target of UPR.The scheme illustrates that ER stress activates the UPR, leading either to resolution of the stress (recovery) or to apoptosis. In addition to the ‘conventional’ UPR target genes, (BiP, PDI, CHOP, etc.) IGF, IGFBP1 and possibly other members of the insulin/IGF signaling pathway are UPR targets. GRP94 and IGFs play a specific role in alleviating ER-stress: GRP94 is essential for production of IGF. Autocrine/paracrine IGF signaling can delivers both anti-apoptotic and pro-recovery signals. In addition, IGF signaling also potentiates an existing UPR, which in turn can control IGF signaling either positively or negatively.</div></div>
