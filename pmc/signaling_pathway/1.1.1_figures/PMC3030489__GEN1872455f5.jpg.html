(A) Pheromone signaling is defective in arv1 cells treated with α-factor. MAT<b>a</b> FUS1∷FUS1-lacZ∷LEU2 and arv1 FUS1∷FUS1-lacZ∷LEU2 cells were transformed with plasmids containing full-length Arv1, AHD, and ΔAHD; the constructs are under the control of the ARV1 promoter and are C-terminally tagged with 3HA in vector pRS416. FUS1-lacZ induction was measured after 2 hr of α-factor treatment (mean ± SEM, n = 3, *P &lt; 0.02, **P &lt; 0.006). (B) Ste12 overexpression rescues signaling defect in arv1 cells. pGAL1-STE12 was expressed in the strains described in A. FUS1-lacZ induction was measured 4 hr after galactose treatment (without α-factor) (mean ± SEM, n = 3).</div></div>
