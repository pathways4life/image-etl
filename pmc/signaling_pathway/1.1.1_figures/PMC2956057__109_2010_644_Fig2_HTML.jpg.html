The design of a proof of the principle experiment where signaling pathway probabilities guide the use of different drug combinations is shown. A line of MMTV-based transgenic mice that develop tumors with demonstrated heterogeneity are used in this scheme. As spontaneous tumors develop, they are biopsied and their gene expression patterns are immediately examined. Based on the patterns of signaling pathway activation, the mice will be grouped into the appropriate therapeutic option or into a control group. Following treatment with the individualized predicted therapeutic combinations, the response of the tumor will be assessed</div></div>
