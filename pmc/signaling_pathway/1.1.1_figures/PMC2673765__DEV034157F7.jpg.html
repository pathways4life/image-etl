From: sonic hedgehog is required in pulmonary endoderm for atrial  septation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Expanded activation of Hedgehog signaling causes aberrant atrial septum  development.</b> (<b>A-H</b>) Constitutive activation of the Hh pathway using  the Cre-activated smoothened-M2 allele (R26-smoM2) in cells that  normally receive Hh signal has no effect on atrial septation, whereas  activating the Hh pathway in a broader domain results in a hypercellular  atrial septum. Whole-mount (A,E) and cross-section (B-D,F-G) histology. (A,B)  Gli1-CreERT2 expression domain demonstrated with the  R26R reporter. (C,D) Constitutive activation of the Hh pathway in the  Gli1-CreERT2 expression domain has no effect on the size  or overall structure of the atrial septum compared with littermate controls  (arrows). (E,F) Nkx2-5Cre expression domain demonstrated  with the R26R reporter. Inset in F depicts  Nkx2-5Cre expression in pulmonary endoderm. (G,H)  Constitutive activation of the Hh pathway in the broader  Nkx2-5Cre domain results in an enlarged atrial septum when  compared with wild-type littermates (arrows).</div></div>
