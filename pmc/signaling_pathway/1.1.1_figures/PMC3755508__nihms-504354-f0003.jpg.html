The canonical pathways for signaling and metabolic activity were created using differential expression data. This figure illustrates pathways affected by differentially regulated transcripts and significance of pathway assignment is a function of the total number of eligible molecules in a given reference pathway. IPA uses the Fisher's exact test to calculate statistical significance of pathway involvement.</div></div>
