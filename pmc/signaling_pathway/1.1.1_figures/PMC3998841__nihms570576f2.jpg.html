The multipathway modeling approach presented here suggests that an integration of multiple intracellular signaling pathway -- namely the MEK–ERK, mTOR–p70 S6K, Akt, and p38–HSP27 pathways -- activities is necessary for hepatocytes to specify death responses to hepatotoxic drug/cytokine co-treatment conditions. This provides motivation of the network-level consideration of multiple survival, stress, and apoptosis signaling pathways in evaluating the hepatotoxicity mechanisms of context-dependent hepatotoxic drugs.
