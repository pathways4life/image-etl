One possible model of the <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways mediating axon guidance in response to Wnt..

The existence of this additional pathway and its interaction with the canonical pathway are supported by the analysis of lin-17; bar-1 double mutants (see Figure 5). According to this model and consistent with our data, both the activation of the uncharacterized pathway and the inhibition of the canonical pathway by LIN-44/Wnt are required for the axons to stop in their correct position.</div></div>
