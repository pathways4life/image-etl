TLR-mediated innate immune-associated signaling pathway inferred by BowTieBuilder. Membrane-bound TLR-proteins are depicted at the top, TFs are depicted at the bottom and the inferred proteins are depicted in-between. The proteins MyD88 and FADD are both in the core module and considered to be essential to this signaling pathway.</div></div>
