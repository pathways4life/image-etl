The canonical pathway controls the inflammatory response, and is coupled to the noncanonical pathway through a feed-forward pathway by the synthesis of TRAF1 and NFκB2, two rate limiting factors in noncanonical pathway activation. Through epigenetic reprogramming and enhanced transcriptional elongation through the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK), the rate-limiting TRAF1/NFκB2 translation is reduced, resulting in enhanced pathway activation in EMT.</div></div>
