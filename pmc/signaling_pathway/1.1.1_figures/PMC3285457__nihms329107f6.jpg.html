Signal transduction diagram depicting how Hic-5 affects TGF-β <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>.  From: Smad7 is Inactivated through a Direct Physical Interaction with the LIM Protein Hic-5/ARA55. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Hic-5, which is induced by TGF-β through a mechanism that is yet to be resolved, binds to and inactivates both Smad3 and Smad7. Inactivation of Smad7 through its degradation relieves the inhibitory action of Smad7 on TGF-β receptors, which leads to phosphorylation and thus activation of Smads 2 and 3. Depletion of Smad7 frees up Hic-5 and is expected to enable further binding to and suppression of Smad3. We thus propose that the overall effect of Hic-5 on TGF-β signaling is inhibition of Smad3-dependent pathway and enhancement of Smad2-dependent or Smad-independent pathway.</div></div>
