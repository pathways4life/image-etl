Significant PSP clusters are highlighted in green while significant PDS is shown in purple. <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>: Regression plots for expression scores of protein complexes and PDSs co-located on the same biological pathway in mod and poor stage respectively. Enveloped in a checked circle are two complex outliers that are low expressing in the mod stage relative to the co-locating PDS but swung to overexpression in the poor stage</div></div>
