From: Esterases and autoimmunity: the Sialic acid acetylesterase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> and the regulation of peripheral B cell tolerance. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Possible mechanisms by which the SIAE-Siglec pathway could mediate tolerance at the B cell level. (A) Within the B cell follicles of lymph nodes, inhibitory signals prevent weakly autoreactive B cells from migrating to the T cell zone and receiving T cell help in the form of activating signals. In contrast defective inhibitory signaling via the SIAE-Siglec pathway allows autoreactive B cells to migrate to the T cell zone where they receive T cell help, undergo somatic mutation and secrete high affinity autoantibodies. (B) Within the germinal center, inhibitory signaling prevents autoreactive B cells from being positively selected in the light zone. Attenuation of SIAE-Siglec inhibition increases the probability of selection of low affinity autoreactive B cell clones. (C) Inhibitory signals mediated by the SIAE-Siglec pathway normally prevent B cells from serving as efficient auto-antigen presenting cells however disruption of this pathway allows B cell presentation to autoreactive T cells.</div></div>
