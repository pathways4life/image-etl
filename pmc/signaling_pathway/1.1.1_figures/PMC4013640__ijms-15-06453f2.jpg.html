From: The Role of Pericytes in Neurovascular Unit Remodeling in Brain Disorders. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Pericyte physical and biochemical interactions at the NVU. Pericytes are embedded within the basal lamina structure and project elongated processes that wrap endothelial cells, thus establishing specialized cell-cell contacts. These contacts are mainly from peg-socket types, where cell-cell contacts are established when pericyte cell membrane protrusion-like structures (pegs) are inserted into endothelial cell membrane invaginations (pockets) cells (outlined by dashed circles). The peg-socket contacts contain cell-to-cell junction proteins, such as N-cadherin and CX43 hemichannels. CX43 hemichannels form gap junctions that allow the biochemical exchange between pericytes and endothelial cells. In parallel, several autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways govern the interaction between pericytes and endothelial cells, such as the PDGFBB/PDGFRβ signaling pathway (paracrine pathway: PDGFBB secreted by endothelial cells binds to PDGFRβ expressed on pericytes), the TGFβ signaling pathway (paracrine and autocrine pathway: TGFβ secreted by endothelial cells and pericytes binds to TGFβR2 expressed on both cell types), the Ang1/Tie2 signaling pathway (paracrine pathway: Ang1 is secreted by pericytes binds to Tie2 expressed on endothelial cells), and the Notch signaling pathway (cleavage-induced signaling pathway: the sequential proteolytic cleavage and release in the intracellular space of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that translocates to the nucleus and controls downstream gene expression).</div></div>
