From: The ?1 Integrin Activates JNK Independent of CagA, and JNK Activation Is Required for Helicobacter pylori CagA+-induced Motility of Gastric Cancer Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>H. pylori stimulates cancer cell motility through the combined CagA-dependent and -independent signaling.</b> CagA is injected into the cell via the α5β1 integrin and associates with known regulators of cell adhesion and motility. CagA-independent activation of the β1 integrin signaling pathway leads to Src-induced JNK stimulation, which in combination with FAK causes paxillinTyr-118 phosphorylation. Although both CagA-dependent and CagA-independent signaling pathways are necessary, neither pathway is sufficient by itself for H. pylori-induced cell motility.</div></div>
