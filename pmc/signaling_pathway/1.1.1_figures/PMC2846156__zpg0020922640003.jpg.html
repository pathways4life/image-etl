From: Therapeutic Targeting of Toll-Like Receptors for Infectious and Inflammatory           Diseases and Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Drugs targeting the TLR4/MD-2 signaling pathway. Activation of TLR4 recruits the                 adapter pairs Mal/MyD88 and TRAM/TRIF. Signaling through Mal/Myd88 recruits IRAK1,                 IRAK4, Traf6, and TAK1-binding protein (TAB) to activate the NFκB signaling                 pathway. Signaling through TRAM/TRIF activates NFκB through TRAF6, but also                 activates signaling through IRF1 and IRF3 through TRAF3. Several drugs now target                 the TLR4/MD-2 signaling pathway. Eritoran and the AGP compounds bind to the                 TLR4/MD-2 lipid IA binding site, monoclonal antibodies (for example the neutralizing                 antibody from NovImmune, Geneva, Switzerland) bind to TLR4. Soluble peptides, such                 as the BB loop peptides, target the BB loop on the TIR domain, the region of the                 protein important in receptor dimerization. The small molecular inhibitor TAK-242                 targets the signaling domain of the TIR.</div></div>
