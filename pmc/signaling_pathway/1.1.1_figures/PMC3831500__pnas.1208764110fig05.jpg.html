From: Neuronal activity regulates astrocytic Nrf2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model for regulation of Nrf2 signaling at tripartite neuronâ€“astrocyte synapse. At a low activity synapse (A), glutamate secreted by presynaptic terminus (red arrow) mildly activates Nrf2 signaling in adjacent astrocytes through mGluR1/5 and Ca2+-dependent pathway. At a high activity synapse (B), increased secretion of glutamate and other (currently unidentified) soluble factors secreted by a presynaptic neuron (brown arrow), postsynaptic neuron (blue arrow), or astrocyte itself (green arrow) strongly activate astrocytic Nrf2 signaling. This regulatory mechanism matches Nrf2 activity in a perisynaptic astrocyte to the firing rate of the adjacent neuronal synapse, maximizing the neuroprotection while minimizing the associated physiologic costs.</div></div>
