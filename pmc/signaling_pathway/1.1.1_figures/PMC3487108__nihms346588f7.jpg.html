Upon direct platelet-tumor cell contact, the NF-κB pathway is also activated in tumor cells and synergizes with TGFβ/Smad signaling to induce a rapid EMT, enhance invasiveness and promote metastasis. Activation of neither the TGFβ/Smad nor the NF-κB pathway alone is sufficient to promote metastasis. Thus, platelet-tumor cell contact triggers a synergistic interaction between TGFβ/Smad and NF-κB pathways that is necessary for efficient metastasis. The metastatic potential of tumor cells therefore continues to evolve outside of the primary tumor site in response to platelet-to-tumor cell signaling.</div></div>
