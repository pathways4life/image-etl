Analyses were repeated in three independent experiments and representative data from one experiment is shown; (<b>B</b>) Integrin signaling pathway showing effects of lunasin treatment in H661 cells. RTKs, Receptor Tyrosine Kinases; SFKs, Src Family Kinases. Proteins shown in red indicate signaling steps negatively affected specifically in H661 cells by lunasin treatment; (<b>C</b>) Relative expression levels of integrin signaling proteins. Immunoblots shown in (<b>A</b>) were analyzed using ImageJ software v1.45 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Data represent the mean Â± SD for three independent experiments. The asterisk (*) indicates a significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference in expression levels relative to the vehicle control.</div></div>
