The unidentified pathway represents the major pathway involved in CO2-induced responses. The cAMP signaling and the unidentified pathway converge on the key regulator Flo8 in the regulation of white-to-opaque switching, whereas the two pathways converge on the Flo8â€“Efg1 complex in the regulation of filamentous growth. HSG, hyphal-specific genes; OSG, opaque-specific genes. (A) A model of CO2-induced filamentation. (B) A model of CO2-induced white-to-opaque switching. Wor1 contains a conserved potential PKA phosphorylation site and has been proven to function downstream of the cAMP pathway.</div></div>
