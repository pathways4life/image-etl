Drosophila Toll pathway is a cytokine receptor pathway that responds indirectly to microbial infection. Distinct circulating receptor proteins recognize different microbial structures or activities and activate a protease cascade, which culminates in the processing of Spätzle. Lys-type PGN, from bacterial cell walls, is recognized by PGRP-SA/PGRP-SD and GNBP1, while GNBP3 detects β-(1, 3)-glucan from fungal cell walls. These upstream recognition events trigger a proteolytic cascade which proceeds through the serine proteases ModSP and Grass to activate Spätzle Processing Enzyme (SPE) which in turn cleaves pro-Spätzle to release the mature Toll ligand, Spätzle. In addition, virulence-associated proteases, released by pathogens, cleave and activate another pathway that requires the protease Persephone and converges on the activation of SPE. The intracellular Toll signaling pathway is very homologous to the mammalian MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. It signals through an upstream complex containing the adaptor proteins dMyD88, Tube and the kinase Pelle (an IRAK homolog). Pelle triggers the phosphorylation, K48-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the IκB protein, Cactus, thereby releasing the Drosophila NF-κB/Rel factors DIF/Dorsal to translocate into the nucleus and transcribe target AMP genes, such as Drosomycin</div></div>
