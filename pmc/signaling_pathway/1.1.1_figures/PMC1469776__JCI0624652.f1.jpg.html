Two cell pairs underwent EMT in response to TGF-β (yellow), 2 underwent reversible scattering (green), and 2 cell pairs served as oncogene controls (black). Shown are the oncogenes cooperating with TGF-β, the predominant signaling pathways activated, and the fold regulation of 5 PDGF pathway genes (red: upregulation; pink: no significant regulation, blue: downregulation). (<b>B</b>) Concentrated, serum-free supernatants from EpRas and EpRasXT cells were tested on huPDGFR-A/FDCP-1 cells for mitogenic activity ([3H]thymidine incorporation). Specificity of the mitogenic response for PDGF was verified by addition of saturating amounts of a neutralizing α–PDGF-A/B antibody.                </div></div>
