Ethylene and GA signaling cascades promote seed germination by decreasing sensitivity to endogenous ABA in imbibed seeds. The abi1-1 and abi3 mutants are ABA insensitive, the sly1 mutant is GA insensitive, and the etr1-1 and ein2 mutants are ethylene insensitive. The positions of the intersections between the ABA, ethylene, and GA pathways are speculative.<b>(B)</b> Inhibition of seedling root growth. Inhibition of root growth in response to increased amounts of ethylene is largely mediated through internal accumulation of auxin. Cytokinin inhibits root growth by stimulating ethylene biosynthesis. ABA inhibition of root growth is apparently not mediated by an increase in ethylene biosynthesis but requires an active ethylene signaling cascade. Either the basal activity of the ethylene pathway is required to synergize ABA action or ABA stimulates the ethylene signaling cascade.</div></div>
