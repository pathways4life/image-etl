From: MiRNA-335 suppresses neuroblastoma cell invasiveness by direct targeting of multiple genes from the non-canonical TGF-? signalling <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic illustration of TGF-β signaling pathway members and potential pathway member LRG1. TGF-β pathway comprises the canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways. miR-335 regulates cell migration and invasion through targeting of the three branches of the non-canonical TGF-β pathway. In this study, miR-335 has been demonstrated to directly target ROCK1, MAPK1 and putative TGF-β member LRG1. miR-335 inhibition of ROCK1 prevents phosphorylation of MLC thereby reducing actomyosin assembly and contraction and ultimately the motile potential of the cells. Similarly, inhibition of MAPK1 signaling also prevents phosphorylation of MLC.</div></div>
