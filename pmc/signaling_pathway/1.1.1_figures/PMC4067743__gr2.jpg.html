(A) Isoprenaline (10 μM) induced LTP in the PRh–PRh pathway but only a transient potentiation in the LA–PRh pathway. (A1) Pooled data (N = 6) demonstrating the isoprenaline-induced potentiation in the PRh–PRh pathway (●) and the LA–PRh pathway (○). (A2) Example of traces for the PRh–PRh pathway, during baseline (black) and 1 h after (red) bath application of isoprenaline. (A3) Example of traces for the LA–PRh pathway during baseline (black) and 10–20 min into (red) bath application of isoprenaline. (B) Isoprenaline-induced potentiation of the PRh–PRh input did not occur if stimulation to the slice was ceased during isoprenaline application, and 20 min following washout. (B1) Pooled data (N = 3) demonstrating that isoprenaline-induced potentiation of the PRh–PRh pathway (●) was prevented (PRh–PRh: P = 0.12). (B2) Example of traces of the PRh–PRh pathway, during baseline (black) and at the end of the experiment (red). (B3) Example of traces for the LA–PRh pathway during baseline (black) and at the end of the experiment (red). (C) Pre-application of the NMDAR antagonist L-689,560 (5 μM) blocked isoprenaline-induced potentiation. (C1) Pooled data (N = 6) demonstrating that isoprenaline-induced potentiation was blocked in both the PRh–PRh (●, P = 0.45) and the LA–PRh inputs (○, P = 0.24) when isoprenaline was co-applied with L-689,560. (C2) Example of traces of the PRh–PRh pathway, during baseline (black) and at (red) the end of the experiment. (C3) Example of traces of the LA–PRh pathway, during baseline (black) and during (red) the co-application of isoprenaline and L-689,560 (10–20 min into co-application). (D) PRh–PRh histogram highlighting that the potentiation observed with the bath application of isoprenaline was blocked by antagonism of β1- or β2-ADRs, VGCCs (verapamil 20 μM or nifedipine 10 μM) or PKA (KT 5720 200 nM or H89 15 μM) or. (E) LA–PRh histogram highlighting that the potentiation observed with the bath application of isoprenaline was blocked by antagonism of β1- or β2-ADRs, VGCCs (verapamil 20 μM or nifedipine 10 μM) or PKA (KT 5720 200 nM or H89 15 μM) Antagonism of either the β1-ADRs (metoprolol) or the β2-ADRs (ICI 118,551) was sufficient to prevent isoprenaline-induced potentiation (measurements taken 10–20 min into co-application).
