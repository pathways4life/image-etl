The inhibition of HH signaling (A) inhibits MM CSC displaying the side population phenotype by (B) inducing terminal plasma cells differentiation of MM CSC as indicated by the expression of CD138. (C) Multiple modes of signaling appear to be active in MM. Experimental data suggest that differentiated plasma cells can produce the ligand necessary for CSC survival and proliferation. Blocking signaling leads to CSC differentiation. Normal bone marrow stromal cells can also produce ligand and signal to myeloma cells to support their growth and survival. A possible role for tumor-to-stoma paracrine signaling may also take occur.</div></div>
