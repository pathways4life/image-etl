Components of the intracellular Suc signaling pathway include the still unknown sensor, cytosolic intermediates, transcription factors that are target of Suc and the SURE response element found in many promoters exhibiting Suc regulation. Suc mimics the effect of high light and cold on a number of metabolic and developmental responses. Horizontal arrows indicate well-known (PhyA and ABA) and putative components of light and low temperature signaling pathways with may cross-talk with Suc.</div></div>
