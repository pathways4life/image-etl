B, inhibition of the RIP2 kinase by PP2 abolishes MDP-triggered phosphorylation of PI3K pathway members p85 and 4EBP1. C, pharmacological inhibition of Notch1 activation by GSI-I-abrogated MDP-triggered phosphorylation of p85 and 4EBP1. D, transient transfection of AKT dominant-negative (AKT D/N) or p85 dominant-negative (p85 D/N) constructs significantly reduced MDP-induced COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages as assessed by immunoblotting. E, pharmacological intervention of PI3K signaling modulates MDP-triggered COX-2 expression. The blots are representative of three independent experiments. Med, medium.</div></div>
