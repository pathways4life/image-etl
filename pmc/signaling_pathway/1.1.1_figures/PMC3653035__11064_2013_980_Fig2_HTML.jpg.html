The inhibition of GSK3α/β in the canonical Wnt pathway can lead to the activation of β-catenin or influence other targets of GSK3α/β. These two possibilities can be called the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and “divergent canonical” Wnt pathway, respectively. <b>c</b> Other WNT molecules and Frizzled receptors can activate planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, in which downstream messenger are ROCK and JNK kinases. <b>d</b> WNT5a can regulate intracellular level of Ca2+, which is involved in many cellular signalings and can inhibit β-catenin/TCF signaling. <b>e, f</b> WNT molecules can also bind to the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) ROR and RYK. The Wnt/RYK pathway regulates neuronal differentiation</div></div>
