DIV6 cortical neurons were treated with BDNF and the MKK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (50 μm) or its vehicle control (0.2% Me2SO). After 8 h, cells were lysed, and 45 S pre-rRNA/18 S rRNA ratios were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Our previously published studies validated the effectiveness and specificity of 50 μm U0126 as an ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor in cultured cortical neurons (46). B, pharmacological inhibition of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway attenuated BDNF-induced activation of the rDNA promoter. DIV4 cortical neurons were cotransfected with the β-gal expression plasmid (pEF1αLacZ) and the rDNA promoter-luciferase construct (0.2 + 0.2 μg of plasmid DNAs/5 × 105 cells, respectively). Two days after transfection, neurons were stimulated as described for A. C, selective activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway with MKK1ca was sufficient to stimulate the rDNA promoter. DIV4 cortical neurons were transfected as described for B. In addition, MKK1ca or MKK1wt was added to the transfection mixtures as indicated. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and then placed in serum-free medium containing the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 (1 μm). This treatment was used to reduce the basal levels of the ERK1/2 pathway activity. Four hours later, cells were lysed, and rDNA promoter activity was determined. In A–C, data from three independent experiments are presented; four sister cultures from each experiment were analyzed in B and C. Error bars are S.E. **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001.</div></div>
