NMJ dismantling model..  From: Drosophila Motor Neuron Retraction during Metamorphosis Is Mediated by Inputs from TGF-?/BMP <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> and Orphan Nuclear Receptors. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The nuclear receptor pathway involving FTZ-F1 and HR39 regulates the EcR-B1 expression in muscle and initiate dismantling. FTZ-F1 and HR39 positively and negatively respectively control the EcR-B1 expression at the postsynapse. FTZ-F1-mediated EcR-B1 expression leads to transcriptional regulation of target genes involved in postsynaptic degradation. Then, TGF-β/BMP signaling is supposed to be induced in response to postsynaptic degradation. We propose that this signal produced by the dismantling muscle is received by the motor neuron where activation of EcR-B1 expression (by TGF-β signaling and nuclear receptor) triggers the axon retraction. In addition, glial cells and macrophages participate to the NMJ dismantling process.</div></div>
