Functional correlation and interaction among the signaling proteins and typical 2-Cys Prxs are reconstituted into a network model using the Pathway Studio software (Ariadne Genomics Inc., USA). All molecules are shown as gene symbol. Direct and indirect regulations were indicated in gray lines and dotted gray lines, respectively. Green arrows indicate regulation by protein modifications. Purple lines indicate direct protein-protein binding.</div></div>
