From: Persistent cAMP-Signals Triggered by Internalized G-Protein-Coupled Receptors. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A model of spatial partial differential equations was generated to simulate the temporal and spatial dynamics of GPCR signaling. (A) Schematic illustration of the basic model. The receptor, G-proteins, and adenylyl cyclase are placed on the plasma membrane, whereas ATP, cAMP, and PDE4 are freely diffusing in the cytosol. PKA is cytosolic, but nondiffusing. (B) Model with the addition of an intracellular signaling compartment (ICSC). To simulate GPCR-cAMP signaling from an ICSC, we placed G-proteins and adenylyl cyclase also on an intracellular membrane and simulated the internalization of both GPCR and ligand to this compartment. (C) Results of simulations. A cell was transiently stimulated by application and removal of the ligand from the extracellular compartment. In a first simulation in which signaling from the ICSC was not implemented (no ICSC), the cAMP response was completely reversible. On the contrary, inclusion of the ICSC in the model lead to sustained cAMP production. Also note the different levels and spatial patterns of PKA activation predicted in the presence or absence of the ICSC.</div></div>
