B and C. Cambogin induced significant cell death in MEF cell lines with PDGFR signaling compared with PDGFR signaling null cells. The cell growth was measured by MTT and photograph was taken under the microscope. D. Cambogin down regulates PDGFR signaling (PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, erk, p-erk, and PARP) in genetically defined MEF cell lines using Western blotting (β-actin was used as internal loading control). Four cell lines (PDGFRα +/+; PDGFRβ +/+, PDGFRα +/+ β+/+ and PDGFR α−/−β−/− cells) were used as indicated.</div></div>
