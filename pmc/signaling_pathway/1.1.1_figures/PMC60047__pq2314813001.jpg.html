(Pathway A), Mechanism proposed by Hershfinkel et al. (5). (Pathway B), Alternative pathway through control of protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases by zinc. Both pathways lead to phospholipase C activation, mobilization of intracellular calcium, and activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Zinc exporters and importers control the transport of zinc between the extracellular space and the cytoplasm.</div></div>
