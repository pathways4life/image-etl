From: The Lipid-Bound Apolipoprotein A-I Cysteine Mutant (N74C) Inhibits the Activation of NF-?B, JNK and p38 in Endotoxemic Mice and RAW264.7 Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">To investigate the effect of different rHDLs on inflammation, we examined the signaling pathway of the RAW264.7 inflammation model treated with different rHDLs. Our results showed that rHDL74 and rHDLwt significantly decreased the activation of p38 and JNK (p&lt;0.05 vs. LPS), while rHDL228 aggravated the activation of ERK (p&lt;0.05 vs. LPS). Control group: RAW264.7 cells without any treatment; LPS group: RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS; rHDL74 group: RAW264.7 inflammation cells treated with rHDL74; rHDL228 group: RAW264.7 inflammation cells treated with rHDL228; rHDLwt group: RAW264.7 inflammation cells treated with rHDLwt. To confirm our experimental results, we performed three independent experiments. A. Western blot analysis at 12 h after rHDL treatment. B. Western blot analysis at 24 h after rHDL treatment. C. The gray value analysis of western blot bands with Image J at 12 h after rHDL treatment. D. The gray value analysis of western blot bands with Image J at 24 h after rHDL treatment. *P&lt;0.05 vs. control; #P&lt;0.05 vs. LPS; Î¨P&lt;0.05 vs. rHDLwt. Error bars indicate SD.</div></div>
