Rare mutations and CNVs (which are both designated by ‡) or                   associated common alleles (which are designated by *) have been identified in                   individuals with ASD in seven genes encoding proteins involved in these signaling                   pathways. Of note, an association between common MET variants and ASD has been                   reported for five independent family cohorts. PLAUR and SERPINE1 associations with                   ASD have been determined in single, large family cohorts (&gt;600 families).                   Ras disruption in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is due to alterations in cholesterol                   biosynthesis (which is designated by †). Also depicted are other                   proteins that interact with the MET signaling pathway, such as semaphorins,                   plexins, and other RTKs. MET can signal via the PI3K and the ERK pathway. RTKs,                   including MET, are involved in key neurodevelopmental processes, including axon                   guidance, synapse formation, and plasticity. Convergence of many different genetic                   etiologies suggests that risk via ERK/PI3K signaling may be common in ASD. Risk,                   severity of the pathophysiology (i.e., intellectual disability), and disorder                   heterogeneity may relate to differences in genetic and epigenetic points of entry                   to the pathways. Thus, the impact due to genetic risk, via regulators of ligand                   availability or RTKs such as MET, may be less severe than the more severe clinical                   impact (i.e., intellectual disability) from disruption downstream along the                   intracellular signaling pathways. c-cbl, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase c-Cbl; rheb,                   Ras homolog enriched in brain; RSK, ribosomal S6 kinase; uPA, urokinase                   plasminogen activator.</div></div>
