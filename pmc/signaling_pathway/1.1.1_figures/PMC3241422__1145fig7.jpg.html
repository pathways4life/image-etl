The majority of genes regulated by CWI signaling are under the control of the Rlm1 transcription factor, which is phosphorylated and activated by Mpk1. Among these genes is MLP1, which encodes a pseudokinase paralog of Mpk1. Using a mechanism that is independent of protein kinase catalytic activity, Mpk1, together with Mlp1, drive expression of a subset of cell wall stress-induced genes through the Swi4/Swi6 transcription factor (including FKS2).</div></div>
