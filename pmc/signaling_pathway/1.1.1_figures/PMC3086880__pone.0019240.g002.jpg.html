The total number of signalogs in each species is shown in parentheses. Although we predicted a total of 253 signalogs, this statistical comparison contains 301 novel pathway components, because 39 signalog proteins were assigned to more than one pathway (these 39 had a total of 87 pathway annotations).</div></div>
