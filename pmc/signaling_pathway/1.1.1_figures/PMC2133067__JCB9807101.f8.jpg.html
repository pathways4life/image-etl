From: Tumor Suppressor PTEN Inhibits Integrin- and Growth Factor-mediated Mitogen-activated Protein (MAP) Kinase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways . </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Working model of  the PTEN regulatory network. Integrins and growth  factors can separately stimulate the Ras/ERK/MAP kinase pathway or function  collaboratively. Integrin receptor engagement with FN  stimulates FAK, Shc and c-Src,  and they activate the pathway as described (Schlaepfer  et al., 1998). Growth factors  can activate the pathway  through autophosphorylation of growth factor receptors. PTEN reduces Shc phosphorylation and its interaction with Grb2, as well as the downstream Ras/ ERK common MAP kinase pathway for integrin- and growth factorâ€“mediated signaling, and then affects cell spreading and focal  contact formation. Activated MEK1 can partially reverse the latter effects of PTEN.</div></div>
