IGF1 binding to the IGF1R also induces IGF1R autophosphorylation and this serves to increase the kinase pathway that promotes the phosphorylation and activation of AKT. <b>(B)</b> CP binding to the IGF1R preferentially increases β-arr1 signaling, and inhibits the IGF1R kinase pathway. By this mechanism, CP downregulates IGF1R and AKT signaling, and increases ERK-mediated mitogenic signaling.</div></div>
