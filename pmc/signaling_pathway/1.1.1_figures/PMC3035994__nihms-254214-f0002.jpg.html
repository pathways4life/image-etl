From: High Fat Diet Induced Obesity and Nutrient Sensing TOR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Simplified model of nutrient signaling pathways influencing metabolic responses. InR and TOR pathway components are virtually all unique orthologous genes in Drosophila. TOR signaling also receives inputs from the energy sensing AMPK. Future studies will elucidate how the components of the InR-TOR signaling pathway modulate fat accumulation due to high levels of dietary fats, using the versatility and genetic simplicity of the Drosophila model. Unlike the complexity and interrelation between these pathways in mammals, Drosophila is ideal to study their role in controlling complex traits like HFD effects on disease.</div></div>
