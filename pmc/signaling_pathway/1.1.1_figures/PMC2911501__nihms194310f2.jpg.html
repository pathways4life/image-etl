From: Neuronal intrinsic barriers for axon regeneration in the adult CNS. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">gp130-dependent cytokines promote axon regeneration and SOCS3 act as a critical negative regulator of the signaling pathway. Injury-induced cytokines act on their receptor complexes with a shared component gp130 and activate the JAK-STAT cascade in both PNS and CNS neurons. Phosphorylated STAT-3 is translocated to the nucleus and initiate gene expression for axon regeneration. However, in the adult CNS, the activation of this pathway leads to the up-regulation of SOCS3 which will inhibit JAK2 and STAT3 and in turn inhibit this pathway. Thus, in SOCS3 deleted RGCs, both endogenous and exogenous cytokines such as CNTF promote significant axon regeneration [ 50**].</div></div>
