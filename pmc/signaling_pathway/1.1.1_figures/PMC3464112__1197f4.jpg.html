(A) PUF-8 functions at multiple stages in the development of gametes. These functions include promoting stem cell maintenance (Ariz et al. 2009; Bachorik and Kimble 2005), inhibition of the proliferative fate in GSCs (this work), inhibition of the male sexual fate (Bachorik and Kimble 2005), and inhibition of dedifferentiation of male germ cells progressing through meiosis (Subramaniam and Seydoux 2003). (B and C) Models of PUF-8 function in regulating the balance between the proliferative fate and meiotic entry. Illustration of distal end of gonad showing the DTC (yellow), mitotic cells (green) and meiotic cells (red). (B) PUF-8 may inhibit the activity of GLP-1/Notch signaling. GLP-1/Notch signaling levels are thought to be high at the very distal end, and lower as cells progress proximally. In this model, PUF-8 contributes to the lowering of GLP-1/Notch signaling levels, allowing cells to enter meiotic prophase. The inhibition of GLP-1/Notch signaling may not be direct, but rather PUF-8 may inhibit the activity of a positive regulator of GLP-1/Notch signaling. (C) PUF-8 may inhibit the proliferative fate in a pathway that is parallel to the GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. In both models (B and C) PUF-8 is shown to be active throughout the distal end of the gonad; however, it is possible that another factor or post-translational modification causes PUF-8 not to be active in some regions where it is expressed.</div></div>
