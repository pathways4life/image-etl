A, spontaneous mammary tumor development in MMTV-neu mice fed with either a HFD or normal diet. Each group contained 10 mice. The incidence of spontaneous tumor growth in MMTV-neu mice was based on tumors larger than 5 mm in diameter in the mammary gland. B, representative images of immunofluorescence staining of tumor tissues with the indicated antibodies. The relative fluorescence intensity from the images is shown on the right. The data represent the mean ± SD, (10 mice per group). ND, normal chow diet. *, P &lt; 0.05.</div></div>
