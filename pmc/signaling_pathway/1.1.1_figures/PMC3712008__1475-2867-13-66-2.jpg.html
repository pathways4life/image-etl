A total of 182 genes with more than 7 mutations in 602 breast cancer samples were used. Among them, 78 (43%) were mapped in the subnetwork and subsequently clustered into 12 modules, six of which were greater than 4. Finally, modules functions were assessed with pathway enrichment analysis (FDR &lt; 0.05). Three main pathways can be recognized: the P53 pathway and DNA repair (14 genes/18%) in blue, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (13 genes/18%) in pink and the MAPK pathway (8 genes/10%) in green.</div></div>
