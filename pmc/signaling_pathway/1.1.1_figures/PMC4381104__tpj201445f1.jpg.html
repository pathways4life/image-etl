These genes can be categorized based on their functions into metabolic process (53.6%), growth (27.7%), pigmentation (12%), viral reproduction (3.8%) and cell proliferation (2.3%). (<b>a2</b>) The differentially expressed genes between 5-FU-resistant and control HCT116 cells were subjected to ingenuity pathway analysis and the top five enriched signaling networks were obtained. (<b>b1</b>) Gene Ontology analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes between oxaliplatin-resistant and control HCT116 cells were enriched in functions involving rhythmic process (31.7%), viral reproduction (27.2%), cellular process (26.2%), cell proliferation (7.7%) and metabolic process (6.1%).
