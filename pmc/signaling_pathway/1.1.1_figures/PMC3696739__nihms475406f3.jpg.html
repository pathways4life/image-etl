Downstream <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> engaged by PTHrP during embryonic mammary development.  From: Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein Specifies the Mammary Mesenchyme and Regulates Embryonic Mammary Development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PTHrP is secreted from the mammary epithelium (pink) and acts on the mammary mesenchyme (blue) to activate signaling via Î²-catenin. This pathway directs sexual dimorphism, in part via regulation of AR expression, and possibly regulates the response to BMP signaling. PTHrP signaling, via PTHR1, also upregulates BMPR1a and sensitizes mammary mesenchymal cells to BMP4, possibly upregulating BMP signaling in the mammary mesenchyme. This pathway is required for bud outgrowth, via MMP2 and for inhibiting hair folliculogenesis in the nipple, via Msx2. PTHrP signaling also maintains mammary epithelial identity via signaling in the mammary mesenchyme, although the exact mechanism remains unknown.</div></div>
