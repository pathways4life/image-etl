The data presented in this report show that TGF-β1 induces an EGFR/Ras gene expression signature marked by increased Egfr expression, which sensitized GIF-14 cells to EGF. The activation of EGFR/Ras pathway promotes stemness and tumorigenicity in GIF-14 cells in a MEK1/2-dependent manner that did not involve increased EMT.</div></div>
