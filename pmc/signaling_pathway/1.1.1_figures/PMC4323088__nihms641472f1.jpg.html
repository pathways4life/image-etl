The signaling cascade commences upon the formation of an FGF binding complex, consisting of two FGF ligands, two heparin sulfate chains, and two FGFRs. Signal transduction largely follows one of three pathways. The RAS/MAP kinase pathway, initiated upon the formation of an FRS2 complex, controls cell proliferation and differentiation. The PI3/AKT pathway is also initiated by the formation of an FRS2 complex, and regulates cell survival and fate determination. Finally, upon binding of PLCγ to the activated FGFR, DAG and IP3 are formed, activating PKC. The PLCγ pathway influences cell morphology, migration, and adhesion.</div></div>
