(<b>A</b>) Tumor cells must evade pSmad3C-imposed growth inhibition if they are to thrive. More specifically, such tumor cells depend on highly activated Ras/pSmad3L signaling to drive their proliferation. Selective blockade of linker phosphorylation can suppress the Ras/pSmad3L pathway, while restoring the lost cytostatic pSmad3C signaling as present in mature epithelial cells. Later, in tumor development, TGF-β transmits an invasive signal via the pSmad2L/C pathway together with oncogenic pSmad3L signaling. (<b>B</b>) During human carcinogenic process, benign tumors affected by somatic mutations including Ras undergo transition from the tumor-suppressive pSmad3C pathway to the oncogenic pSmad3L pathway, becoming carcinoma in situ. Advanced carcinomas acquire more invasive and proliferative properties via the pSmad2L/C and pSmad3L pathways when carcinoma in situ receives TGF-β signals from the reactive stroma.</div></div>
