Formation of the MyD88 homodimer favors recruitment of IRAK1 into a complex with TRAF6 [65]. The MyD88 dimer then dissociated from this complex to be either degraded or reused. The second critical network reaction, TRAF6/IRAK1 ubiquitination, occurred via the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc13 and Uev1A, and was necessary for activation of NF-kappa-B and AP-1 through canonical IKK phosphorylation. Either of the two critical network reactions could completely abrogate the flux through the MyD88 pathway even though the TIR- or TIRAP-dependent TLR signaling was almost always active.</div></div>
