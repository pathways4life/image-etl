Our previous studies show that administration of MSCs significantly increased tPA in astrocytes in the ipsilateral IBZ and coculture of MCS with neural parenchymal cells upregulated mRNA and protein levels of Shh and tPA, which were abolished by the small interfering RNA (siRNA) that reduces the expression of the Shh gene (siRNA-Shh), and cyclopamine that specifically blocks Shh signaling (Chen et al., 2002a; Cooper et al., 1998). These data suggest that MSC stimulation of the Shh pathway mediates this increase of tPA. Our in vivo data support the observation that administration of MSCs not only increases tPA but also significantly reduces PAI-1 expression in astrocytes. The TGF-β pathway regulates PAI-1 expression (Docagne et al., 2002; Milei et al., 2004). Our in vitro data show that MSCs repress the TGF-β pathway in astrocytes, which may lead to reduced PAI-1 expression. Blockage of the TGF-β pathway in astrocytes by a TGF-β neutralizing antibody abolished PAI-1 induced by coculture of MSCs and astrocytes. These data suggest that MSCs interact with astrocytes to enhance tPA and concurrently reduce PAI-1 via the TGF-β pathway. The spatiotemporal pattern in the adult IBZ of how the Shh pathway upregulates tPA expression in parenchymal cells and the TGF-β pathway regulates PAI-1 expression in activated astrocytes, have not been fully investigated.</div></div>
