From: Heart Valve Development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Signaling network model for heart valve development and remodeling. In the signaling network model for cardiac cushion development, numerous signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators act to coordinately regulate the process of heart valve formation. Each signaling pathway is a simplified schema of the signaling events that occur; see Figures 2 through 7 for the details of these signaling pathways. Red arrows denote positive/synergistic interactions between pathways. Blunt red arrows denote inhibitory effects between pathways.</div></div>
