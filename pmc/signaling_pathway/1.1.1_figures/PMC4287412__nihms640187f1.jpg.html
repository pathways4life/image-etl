Expression of Wnt pathway activators WNT1 (A), WNT3A (B), WNT5A (C), WNT7B (D), WNT10B (E), and WNT11 (F) were measured by real-time PCR. Expression of activation (CTNNB (G)) and inhibition (AXIN2 (H)) of canonical Wnt signaling were also measured. Osteoblast maturation was confirmed by OCN expression (I). *p &lt; 0.05, vs. TCPS; #p &lt; 0.05, vs. PT; $p &lt; 0.05, vs. SLA.</div></div>
