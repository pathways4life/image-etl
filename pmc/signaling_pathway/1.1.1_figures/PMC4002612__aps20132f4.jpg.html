(A) EMSA analysis of NF-κB DNA-binding activity in vitro. (B) Immunofluorescence analysis of p65 nuclear translocation in HeLa cells. Cells were pretreated with DMSO or P1 for 6 h and then stimulated with or without TNF-α. (C) HeLa cells were pretreated with P1 for 6 h and then stimulated with TNF-α for 30 min. Nuclear proteins were prepared for Western blot analysis. (D) Western blot analysis of the NF-κB signaling pathway in HeLa cells after treatment with P1 for 6 h.
