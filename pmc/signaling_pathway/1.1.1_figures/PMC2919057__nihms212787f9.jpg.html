A model to implicate Tiam1/Rac1 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> in PA-induced, CER-mediated effects on isolated β-cells.  From: Tiam1/Rac1 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> mediates palmitate-induced, ceramide-sensitive generation of superoxides and lipid peroxides and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in pancreatic ?-cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Based on the data accrued in the current studies we propose that incubation of isolated β-cells to either PA [but not oleate] or C2-CER [but not DHC] leads to Tiam1-mediated activation of Rac1, which is a key member of the NOX assembly. In addition, PA or C2-CER promotes the expression of p47phox in these cells. Together, these signaling steps promote the assembly and activation of NOX holoenzyme leading to the production of superoxides and lipid peroxides. These, in turn, exert damaging effects on the mitochondria including reduction in MMP leading to the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction. Appropriate sites of inhibition of these signaling steps by FB-1, NSC23766 and DPI are also indicated in the figure.</div></div>
