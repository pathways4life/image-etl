From: Conditionally Replicating Adenoviruses for Cancer Treatment. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Adenovirus VA RNA inhibition of both the Interferon/PKR pathway. VA RNAs (with imperfect-stemloop secondary structure) inhibit IFN-induced PKR signaling leading to downstream eIF2α phosphorylation and ultimate protein translation inhibition. Ras signaling via MEK and its substrate ERK may also inhibit IFN-induced PKR activation by preventing PKR phosphorylation. Additionally, VA RNAs may also be processed into siRNAs and inhibit the functionality of the host cell’s Dicer/RISC RNAi pathway, thus blocking degradation of short viral dsRNAs as well as the cell’s endogenous miRNA/siRNA synthesis pathway.</div></div>
