Proteasome-mediated proteolysis promotes dephosphorylation of the JAK2 kinase and, consequently, negatively regulates JAK/STAT3 signaling in CRC. Other unknown mechanisms may also have been involved in this process. Furthermore, JAK1, 2/STAT3 signaling is implicated in many areas of tumor progression, including cell growth, survival, invasion, and migration by regulation of gene expressions, such as Bcl-2, p16ink4a, p21waf1/cip1, and p27kip1, E-cadherin, VEGF, and MMPs. Additionally, FAK may be a component of the JAK pathway and a downstream of JAK, which may exert its oncogenic effects through interaction with other signal transduction pathways.</div></div>
