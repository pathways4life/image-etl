From: Dab2 inhibits the cholesterol-dependent activation of JNK by TGF-?. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A model for regulation of TGF-β signaling by Dab2 and cholesterol. TβRI is distributed in multiple plasma membrane domains, including CCPs and cholesterol-rich domains/caveolae. Although Smad signaling in response to TGF-β is not affected by TβRI localization to either domain, TGF-β stimulation of the JNK pathway is initiated mainly in the cholesterol-rich domains. Dab2, which binds both TβRI and clathrin, targets TβRI preferentially to CCPs, shifting the balance of TGF-β signaling such that Smad signaling is retained while JNK activation is diminished.</div></div>
