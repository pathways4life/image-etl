A. qRT-PCR analysis indicated Ce increased the mRNA expression of BMP2 in BMSCs. B. Western bolt analysis showed Ce cause a time-dependent increase of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation. C. BMSCs treated with Ce for 30 minutes led to the preferential nuclear localization of p-Smad1/5/8. D. Western blot analysis indicated that p-Smad1/5/8 was decreased in LDN-193189 pretreated BMSCs. E. qRT-PCR analysis indicated pre-treatment with LDN-193189 significantly blocked the Ce-mediated upregulation of SDF-1 and Runx2 mRNA expression, but not influence the expression of BMP2 mRNA. Data are presented as mean Â± SD from a representative of three separate experiments. *P&lt; 0.05.</div></div>
