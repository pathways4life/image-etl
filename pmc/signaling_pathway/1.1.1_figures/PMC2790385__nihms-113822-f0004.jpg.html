(<b>A</b>) NFATc4 and Sox10 synergistically activate the Krox20 MSE and P0 promoter. DRG cocultures were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs containing the Krox20 MSE, P0 promoter or Krox20 promoter. Expression constructs encoding constitutively active calcineurin A (CnA*), NFATc4, and Sox family members were co-transfected. Luciferase activities were measured. Fold activation is relative to reporter baseline activities (n = 6, error bars, +SEM, ***P &lt; 0.001; t test). (<b>B</b>) Model of myelination process regulated by calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. Solid arrows, calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway; dotted arrows, pathways defined by previous literature.</div></div>
