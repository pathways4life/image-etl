From: Activated Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> induces myofibroblast differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, contributing to pulmonary fibrosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Wnt signaling regulates the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). (A) The Wnt signaling pathway was highly activated after lung injury. The expression of Wnt signaling components β-catenin and MMP-2 were increased in each group. The activated Wnt signaling may determine the differentiation of MSCs in vivo. (B and C) MSCs were cultured until they reached confluence and then treated with Wnt3α and DKK1 for 14 days. Activation of Wnt signaling induces MSCs to differentiate into myofibroblasts which was inhibited by treatment with DKK1. (B) Immunofluorescent analysis of β-catenin, vimentin and α-SMA expression in MSCs. Scale bar, 50 μm. (C) Expression of β-catenin, vimentin and α-SMA was evaluated in whole cell lysates by western blotting. β-actin was used as the control.</div></div>
