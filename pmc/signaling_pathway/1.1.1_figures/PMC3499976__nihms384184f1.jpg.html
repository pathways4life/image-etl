In this pathway, secreted Wnts bind to Fz receptors in the receiving cell. This binding activates the scaffolding PDZ protein DVL, which disrupts a so-called ‘destruction complex’ containing GSK-3β, axin and APC. In the absence of Wnt signaling, this complex constitutively phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its degradation by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. Wnt binding to Fz receptors disrupts the destruction complex, resulting in cytoplasmic stabilization of β-catenin and its import into the nucleus. In the nucleus, β-catenin associates with members of the LEF/TCF transcription factor family to regulate transcription. Also depicted are a Wnt antagonist FRP and an inhibitor of GSK-3, frequently rearranged in advanced T-cell lymphomas–GSK-3-binding protein (Frat–GBP), which can also bind to DVL. <b>(b)</b> The Wnt–Ca2+ signaling pathway. In this pathway, Fz activation by Wnts leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ and nuclear import of the transcription factor NF-AT. <b>(c)</b> The Frizzled nuclear import (FNI) pathway. In this signaling pathway, Wnts binds to Fz2 receptors in the receiving cell. Fz is endocytosed and back-transported towards the nucleus in a process that depends on its binding to the 7-PDZ protein GRIP. At some point during this trafficking, the C-terminal region of Fz2 is cleaved, and the cleaved fragment imported into the nucleus. <b>(d)</b> The divergent canonical Wnt pathway. In this signaling pathway, Wnt binding to Fz inhibits the destruction complex, and prevents the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins such as MAP1B, Tau and MAP2, thereby regulating microtubule stability. <b>(e)</b> The PCP pathway. In this transduction pathway, Fz acts through JNK to regulate the cytoskeleton.
