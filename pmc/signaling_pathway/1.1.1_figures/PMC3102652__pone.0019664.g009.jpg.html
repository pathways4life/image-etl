In this study, we further demonstrated that the Tim-3 inhibitory pathway is involved in the HCV core/gC1qR-induced inhibition of IL-12 expression by M/MФ during HCV infection. Specifically, we found that Tim-3 can be up-regulated by HCV core/gC1qR interaction, which in turn, inhibits TLR-mediated IL-12 production. We also found that Tim-3 can crosstalk with other inhibitory molecules such as PD-1 and SOCS-1 to coordinately inhibit TLR-mediated IL-12 signaling pathways during HCV infection. We conclude that HCV-mediated innate immune dysregulation (impaired M/MФ IL-12 production) may ultimately lead to adaptive Th1/Tc1 dysfunction, and thus, HCV persistence.</div></div>
