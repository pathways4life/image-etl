To address the potential involvement of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in DPN-treated EAE animals, we performed immunohistochemistry of CC-containing brain slices andWestern analysis of dissected callosal protein lysates. Using immunohistochemistry, robust p-PI3K immunostaining was seen co-labeled with CC1+ OLs <b>(i)</b>. Likewise, by Western analysis, DPN-treated EAE mice revealed an elevated level of p-PI3K (**p&lt;0.001) to support the role of DPN-mediated activation of PI3K <b>(ii-iii). (B)</b> Western analysis of Akt, p-Akt (Thr308), and GAPDH revealed no significant difference in the levels of Akt between, normal, EAE+vehicle, and EAE+DPN groups <b>(i).</b> However, a significant increase in p-Akt was detected in DPN-treated EAE mice to confirm the activation of p-Akt in response to upstream signaling events (*p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.001) (<b>i-ii</b>). <b>(C)</b> Activation of the mTOR pathway in DPN-treated EAE animals was assessed by immunohistochemistry, which revealed the presence of p-mTOR (Ser2448) in the CC and spinal cord dorsal column <b>(i)</b>. Western analysis of mTOR, p-mTOR, and GAPDH presents a three-fold increase in p-mTOR levels in DPN-treated EAE mice relative to normal mice <b>(ii-iii). (D)</b> DPN treatment during EAE enhances P70S6K activation downstream of mTOR pathway to facilitate protein synthesis. Western analysis of P70S6K, p-P70S6K (Thr389), and GAPDH revealed undetectable levels of p-P70S6K in EAE+vehicle mice as compared to normal controls. DPN-treated EAE protein lysates showed a significant increase in p-P70S6K to confirm the activation of DPN-mediated mTOR signaling pathway (<b>i-ii</b>) (**p&lt;0.001;ANOVA; n=6).</div></div>
