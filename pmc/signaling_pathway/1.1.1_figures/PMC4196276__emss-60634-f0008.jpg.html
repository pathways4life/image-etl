From: Entourage: Visualizing Relationships between Biological Pathways using Contextual Subsets. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">However, when tested in clinical trials, TNF-alpha inhibiting compounds were not effective against GVHD but could later be repositioned for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (focus pathway). Entourage shows Rheumatoid Athritis as closely related to the GVHD pathway (see pathway list on the left). Entourage also reveals seemingly contradictory roles of TNF-alpha. It is involved in cell death (Apoptosis) and also in cancer (i.e., uncontrolled cell growth) through the MAPK signaling pathway.</div></div>
