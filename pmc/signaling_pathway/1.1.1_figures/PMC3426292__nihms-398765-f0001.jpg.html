These include the Hpo kinase cassette (outlined in green), the Mer-ex complex (outlined in purple), the Fat branch of the pathway (outlined in orange), and transcription factors (within nucleus, shaded grey). Arrows depict key regulatory connections, pointed arrows show activating effects, block arrows show inhibiting effects.</div></div>
