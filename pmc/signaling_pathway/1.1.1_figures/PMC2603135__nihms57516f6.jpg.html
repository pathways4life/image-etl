Shown in the map are two proteins, p53 (TP53) and BRCA1 (highlighted in red boxes), directly interact with ATM (green box) as its downstream signaling proteins. The right diagram depicts the ATM-p53 mediated and radiation-induced DNA repair pathway involving RRM2. The RRM2â€™s connections to p53 and HDAC1 were derived from the network analysis and were consistent with the expression data in this study. Both BRCA1 and HDAC1 are known to be involved in DNA repair. The interactions between p53 and RRM2 proteins and between HDAC1 and RRM2 gene promoter have been reported in literature. The red colored proteins are observed as differentially expressed in response to radiation from this study. Solid arrows indicate direct binding, and dotted ones indicate multi-step processes.</div></div>
