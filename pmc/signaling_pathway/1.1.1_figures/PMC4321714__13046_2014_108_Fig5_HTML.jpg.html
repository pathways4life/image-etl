Pathway analysis is a functional analysis that maps genes to KEGG pathways. The top five upregulated pathways <b>(C)</b> and top five downregulated pathways <b>(D)</b> in HATi II-treated U251 cells are listed. The “p53 signaling pathway”, which is associated with apoptosis, was activated in HATi II-treated U251 cells. <b>(E)</b> Confirmation of the microarray results. The expression of p53 signaling pathway-related genes in HATi II-treated U251, HS683, U87 and SHG44 cells was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. The columns represent the log-transformed median fold changes in expression relative to DMSO-treated cells.</div></div>
