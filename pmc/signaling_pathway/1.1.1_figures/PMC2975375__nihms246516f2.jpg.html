Time course measurements of GFP fluorescence were done to calculate the baseline and slope of pathway activation, under conditions of linear pathway response. Baseline and slopes were then normalized relative to wild type values and the resulting values were plotted in pathway morphospace. <b>B</b>, gene duplications had minor effects on mating pathway response dynamics, with most values clustered around wild type. <b>C</b>, domain duplications had also minor effects on mating pathway response dynamics; duplication of Ste50 [N] (Ste50’s SAM domain), Ste5 [N] (which includes Ste5’s RING domain) and Ste11 [N] (Ste11’s SAM domain) are exceptions with low slopes and may act as dominant negative. <b>D</b>, domain recombination led to a diverse set of novel signaling behaviors. Recombination variants with dynamic behaviors most different from wild type and from the corresponding co-expressed N- and C-domain pair (Fig. S3) are shown in red. <b>E</b>, these behaviors could not be recapitulated by co-expression of the unlinked corresponding pairs of domains. Fluorescent values were measured in at least two independent experiments, each time in triplicates. Mean values +/− standard deviation (error bars) are depicted.</div></div>
