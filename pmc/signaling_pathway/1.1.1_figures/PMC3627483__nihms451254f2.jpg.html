Genes in the KEGG endometrial cancer signaling pathway showed significant enrichment in PET+ versus PET− tumors (FDR q value = 0.006). The top portion of the figure plots the enrichment scores (ES) for each gene, whereas the bottom portion of the plot shows the value of the ranking metric moving down the list of ranked genes. The table enumerates the genes in the pathway for which a majority of probe sets were significantly enriched and upregulated in PET-positive versus PET-negative tumors. FDR q value (FDR, false discovery rate); FWER p value (FWER, family wise-error rate).</div></div>
