Upon DAF-2 activation, several serine-threonine kinases phorphorylate DAF-16, causing the transcription factor to be retained in the cytoplasm and inhibiting its transcriptional-regulatory activity. Consequently, DAF-2â€“regulated gene expression is affected, causing the downregulation of immune defense genes such as lys-7 and thn-2. Germline signaling and heat shock regulate DAF-16 in parallel to the effect of PA14 and DAF-2 activity. DAF-2 and DAF-16 may function in a network with other signaling components to affect the expression of DAF-2-regulated genes including spp-1.</div></div>
