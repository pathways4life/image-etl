SOS stimulates the release of bound GDP from RAS, and it is exchanged for GTP, leading to the active RAS-GTP conformation. The GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) can bind to RAS-GTP and accelerate the conversion of RAS-GTP to RAS-GDP (guanosine diphosphate), which terminates signaling. Mutated RAS is constitutively active in the RAS-GTP conformation. Activated RAS regulates multiple cellular functions through effectors including the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, PI3K, RALGDS, RALGDS-like gene (RLG) and RGL2.</div></div>
