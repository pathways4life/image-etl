Notably, Ire1 has a broad range of physiological roles in C. neoformans not only in Hxl1-dependent but also Hxl1-independent manners. Solid arrow indicates direct involvement of the UPR pathway (e.g., ER stress) and dotted arrow indicates the direct or indirect activation of the UPR pathway via potential cross-talk with other signaling pathways.</div></div>
