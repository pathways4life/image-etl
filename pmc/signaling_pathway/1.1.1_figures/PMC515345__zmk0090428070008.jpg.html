From: Polarized Membrane Traffic and Cell Polarity Development Is Dependent on Dihydroceramide Synthase-Regulated Sphinganine Turnover. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Working model that describes the relationship between sphinganine metabolism, polarized membrane traffic from SAC, and apical PM biogenesis in response to cAMP/PKA signaling in HepG2 cells. First, cAMP/PKA signaling reorganizes polarized membrane traffic from the SAC, which includes the rerouting of a fluorescent lipid probe from a basolateral direction into the transcytotic pathway, leading to the apical surface. Activation of this pathway is crucial for cAMP/PKA-stimulated polarity development. cAMP/PKA signaling also increases the activity of dihydroceramide synthase, thereby stimulating the turnover of sphinganine. The inability to turn over sphinganine and the consequent accumulation of free sphinganine inhibits cAMP/PKA-induced activation of the apical PM directed traffic route from SAC and, hence, polarity development.</div></div>
