Kinase cascade components STK, LATS, MOB, and SAV1 interact, leading to the phosphorylation and cytosolic sequestration of YAP and WWTR1 transcription factors. Caspase 3 may activate this process by cleaving STK3, increasing its kinase activity. Cytosolic sequestration of YAP and WWTR1 may also be mediated by AMOT and ZO proteins.</div></div>
