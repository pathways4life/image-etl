Independent recruitment of several checkpoint proteins leads to TOPBP1-dependent activation of the kinase and phosphorylation of numerous substrates including CHK1 to regulate cellular responses to DNA damage and replication stress. (B) The table lists newly identified regulators of this pathway and, when known, describes their position in the pathway. See text for details.</div></div>
