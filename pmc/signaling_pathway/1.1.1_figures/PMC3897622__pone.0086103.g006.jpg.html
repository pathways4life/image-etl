This complex then activates Rho pathway activation, either by sequestration of RhoGAP away from Rho, or by increasing Rho turnover. In DKO4 cells, RasGAP is not expressed, due in part to a truncating mutation and in part to lack of expression downstream of active KRAS. In this situation, RhoGAP is not phosphorylated, and so Rho pathway phenotypes are inactive. When RasGAP is overexpressed in DKO4, RhoGAP is once again phosphorylated and Rho pathway is active- however, lack of stabilization and/or contributing signaling pathways from active RAS means that tumorigenicity does not attain the same level as DLD1. The bottom of the figure summarizes the main characteristics of RhoGAP and RasGAP in these cell lines.</div></div>
