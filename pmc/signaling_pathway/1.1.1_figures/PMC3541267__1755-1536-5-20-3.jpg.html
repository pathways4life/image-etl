From: Role of stem/progenitor cells in reparative disorders. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Signaling pathways driving mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into lineages found in reparative disorders.</b> While Wnt10b represses adipogenesis through the activity of B-catenin/TCF/Lef transcriptional complexes, activation of the non-canonical Wnt pathway by Wnt5b leads to repression of TCF/β-catenin transcriptional activity and yields the opposite results. Non-canonical TGFβ signaling participates in bone formation through activation of the osteogenesis regulator Runx2. On the other hand, canonical TGFβ signaling plays a central role in the regulation of the fibrogenic gene program. The BMP signaling pathway drives osteogenesis through SMADs 1, 5, 8 and shares the SMAD4 component with the TGFβ pathway.</div></div>
