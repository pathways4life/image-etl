From: FoxM1 and Wnt?-catenin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Glioma Stem Cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Dysregulated Wnt-FoxM1/ β-catenin signaling pathway regulates self-renewal and tumorigenecity of GSCsWnt activates its receptor Frizzled and co-receptor LRP5/6 to disrupt or functionally inactivate the destruction complex containing Axin/APC/CK1/GSK3β, leading to aberrant accumulation of β-catenin in cytosol. FoxM1 can bind to free β-catenin in cytosol and subsequently translocate into nucleus. In nucleus, FoxM1/β-catenin complex is associated with TCF4 on Wnt target-gene promoters, such as c-myc and cyclinD1, to promote the expression of the Wnt target-genes hence self-renewal and tumorigenecity of GSCs.</div></div>
