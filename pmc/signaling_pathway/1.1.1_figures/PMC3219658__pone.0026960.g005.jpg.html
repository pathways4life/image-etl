Involvement of host-parasite interactions in <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways..  From: Computational Prediction of Host-Parasite Protein Interactions between P. falciparum and H. sapiens. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(<b>A</b>) In a bipartite matrix a parasite protein was linked to a pathway if the corresponding targeted proteins were enriched in the given pathway (FDR&lt;0.05, Fisher's exact test). Utilizing the combined set of host-parasite interactions the matrix was composed of 83 parasite proteins that interacted with proteins in 117 pathways. In addition, a large fraction of pathways had &gt;95% of their proteins being expressed in liver. Specifically, a cluster of prominent signaling pathways emerged that were largely under the control of parasite specific chaperone proteins. In (<b>B</b>) all interactions between parasite chaperones and host proteins that appeared in the cluster of pathways were mapped. Significantly, such a network revolves around parasite proteins PF08_0054 and PFI0875w that garnered most of the host-parasite interactions and largely interfered with proteins of the TNF pathway.</div></div>
