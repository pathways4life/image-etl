In LE rats, COMT, DRD1a and ADCY5 mRNA levels in the NAC (red-filled shapes) are higher than in SD rats. In contrast, MAO(b), ADCY4, PDE10A, PKA (Prkag2) and PP1 (Ppp1r3c) (green-filled shapes) exhibit reduced expression in LE rats compared to SD rats. Adapted from Ingenuity Â® System's database of canonical pathways for Dopamine Receptor Signaling. Where the biochemical annotation in the Ingenuity canonical pathway differs from the gene symbol used by Affymetrix (see Table 1), the Affymetrix gene symbol is included in parentheses.</div></div>
