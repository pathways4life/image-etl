BHK cells were either mock infected or infected with VSV at an MOI of 10. Cell lysates were collected at various time points and assayed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to Akt, p-Akt (Thr308), p-Akt (Ser473), mTOR, p-mTOR (Ser2481), GSK3β, p-GSK3β (Ser9), VSV matrix protein (M), and β-actin.</div></div>
