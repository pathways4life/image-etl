From: PD-1 tempers Tregs in chronic HCV infection. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PD-1 signaling leads to dephosphorylation of molecules in the T cell activation cascade previously phosphorylated in response to TCR ligation. In this issue of the JCI, Franceschini et al. show that PD-1 signaling leads to inhibition of IL-2 signals in Tregs (5). (i) IL-2 signaling via the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) induces STAT-5 phosphorylation (pSTAT-5). (ii) Dimerization and nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT-5 leads to increased proliferation of Tregs but also to PD-1 upregulation. (iii) Increased surface PD-1 expression inhibits STAT-5 phosphorylation (5), possibly via SHP2. ITSM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif.    </div></div>
