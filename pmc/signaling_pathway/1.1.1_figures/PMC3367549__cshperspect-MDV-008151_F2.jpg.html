In the absence of WNT signaling, the effector of canonical WNT signaling, β-catenin is found complexed in the cytoplasm with a destruction complex containing Axin and GSK3β. GSK3β phosphorylates β-catenin, which results in its targeting to and degradation by the proteasome. The binding of canonical WNT ligands to Frizzled (Fz) and LRP5/6 receptors results in the phosphorylation of LRP5/6 through the action of Dishevelled (Dsh). Phosphorylated LRP5/6 recruits Axin away from the destruction complex, liberating β-catenin that accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcriptional regulators of the TCF/LEF family to alter gene expression. AKT and PKC downstream from RTK signaling may inhibit the activity of the β-catenin destruction complex to promote β-catenin signaling. Noncanonical WNT/Ca2+ signaling is initiated by the activation of PLC, probably through trimeric G-proteins such as Gbg. The release of Ca2+ results in the activation of NFAT (nuclear factor associated with T cells) transcription factors through calcineurin (Cn). Other downstream transcription factors (TFs) are activated by PKC and CaMKII. A Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway involves Diego (Dgo), Smurf, and Par6, which through cross-inhibitory interactions with Van Gogh-like (Vangl)-Prickle (Pk) complexes regulate planar cell polarity.</div></div>
