PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2 act as negative regulators of the mTOR pathway, and removal leads to hyperactivation of mTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling requires activation of the adaptor protein raptor, and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which is largely insensitive to acute rapamycin treatment, requires activation of the rictor protein. Although regulation of mTORC2 is less clearly defined, it has been linked to cytoskeleton organization.</div></div>
