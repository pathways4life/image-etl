Illustration of proximal signals initiated during BCR engagement and points where well described inhibitors act. (a) Lck-i acts to inhibit the most proximal signaling event of SFK-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within CD79. Ibrutinib acts to inhibit the ability of Btk to phosphorylate and activate PLCγ2. (b) Fostamatinib acts to inhibit Syk kinase activity as well as that of Lyn. Idelalisib works to inhibit PI3Kδ to limit the formation of PIP3 and has the effect of blocking membrane interaction of signaling proteins containing PH domains such as PDK1, Akt, and Btk.</div></div>
