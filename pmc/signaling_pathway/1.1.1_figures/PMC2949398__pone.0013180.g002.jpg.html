The curve is the distribution of the random number of cancer gene pairs that exist in the same pathway. (<b>B</b>) Distribution of number of activation and repression signals among cancer gene pairs with co-occurring mutations. The red circle (pointed by a red arrow) indicates the real number of activation signals and repression signals that exist among the cancer gene pairs in the human signaling network. The heatmap indicates the union distribution of the random number of activation signals and repression signals that exist among the cancer gene pairs in the human signaling network. (<b>C</b>) Correlation between the distance of cancer genes in the CCA network and their expression similarity.</div></div>
