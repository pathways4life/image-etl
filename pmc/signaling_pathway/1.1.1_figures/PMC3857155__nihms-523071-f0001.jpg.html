From: New Connections Between Old Pathways: PDK1 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Promotes Cellular Transformation through PLK1-Dependent MYC Stabilization. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A basic depiction of the classical view of the PI3K signaling network (black arrows) as well as the novel signaling pathway revealed in the study by Tan et al. (5) (green arrows). Tumors with hyperactive PDK1 signaling, in addition to signaling through the classical downstream effector AKT, induce a novel signaling pathway through phosphorylation of PLK1. Phosphorylation and activation of PLK1 results in phosphorylation of Serine 62 of MYC, leading to stabilization of MYC protein which promotes cellular transformation, in part through transcriptional upregulation of a cancer stem cell-like gene signature. As reported by Tan and colleagues (5), therapeutic targeting of this novel signaling pathway with inhibitors of PDK1 (BX795 or BX912) or PLK1 (BI2536 or GW843682X) promotes programmed cell death of cancer cells that rely on MYC hyperactivation.</div></div>
