In many diseases including cancer, the disorder is caused by deregulation of cellular signaling. Pathway signatures can be a novel tool to assess signaling statuses. The pathway activation/inactivation status in each patient will be monitored by the expression profile and a set of pathway signatures. Identification of the causative pathway allows us to select the "right" drug to inhibit the pathway.</div></div>
