All 13 AKT-dependent proteins can only be activated after the concentration of EGFR protein is getting higher than 10 pM. This activation threshold is due to the presence of mir-181c. <b>D</b>: represents another simulation result without the presence of mir-181c, additionally all other 240 miRNAs were not expressed, as well. At this condition, the activation threshold of these proteins is at 0.001 pM. By comparing these two results (<b>C</b>, <b>D</b>), one can understand that mir-181c raises the activation threshold of the EGFR signaling pathway significantly.</div></div>
