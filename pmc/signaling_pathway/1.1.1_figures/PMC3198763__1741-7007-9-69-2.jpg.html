The mTORC1 signaling pathway controls metabolic pathways active in proliferating cells. This schematic shows our current understanding of how glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and glutamine metabolism are interconnected in proliferating cells. The mTORC1 pathway participates in this metabolic rewiring by controlling the expression of genes (depicted in blue) encoding enzymes involved in glycolysis, the PPP, and lipid synthesis. This metabolic control requires the up-regulation of c-Myc and HIF1Î± (glycolysis), and SREBP1 (lipid biosynthesis and the PPP). mTORC1-dependent metabolic regulation allows for production of both NADPH and intermediates for macromolecular synthesis (depicted in red). c-Myc drives glutamine metabolism, which also supports NADH production.</div></div>
