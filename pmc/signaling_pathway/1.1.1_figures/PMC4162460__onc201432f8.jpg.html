The PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway likely has critical roles in EBV-mediated glucose metabolism reprogramming, which acts mainly by disrupting the stabilization of c-Myc. When the PI3-K/Akt-GSK3beta-FBW7-c-Myc signaling axis is impeded, c-Myc transactivates the transcription of HK2, causing the upregulation of glycolysis and confers resistance against mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, which correlates with the poor overall survival of NPC patients.</div></div>
