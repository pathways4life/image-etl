The image provides an outline of the TWEAK pathway as visualized in the NetPath webpage. The figure shows the statistical details of TWEAK pathway-based reactions (right upper corner). Under, “Molecules involved in TWEAK signaling pathway”, each molecule has been linked to its respective NetPath page. Tabs have been provided which leads to the details of the “pathway authority,” “curators,” and “comments” tab—where the users can provide their feedback and the reaction tabs. “Access to data” indicates links to the events regulated by TWEAK. The pathway can be downloaded from the three standard formats provided at the bottom of the page.</div></div>
