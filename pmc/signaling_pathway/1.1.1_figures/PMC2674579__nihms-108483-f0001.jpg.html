From: PERK-dependent regulation of MDA-7/IL-24-induced autophagy in primary human glioma cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">GST-MDA-7 causes PERK-dependent vacuolization and JNK pathway activation in transformed cells that leads to cell death. Exposure to GST-MDA-7 causes a PERK-dependent activation of the JNK pathway and a PERK-dependent inactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Enhanced JNK pathway signaling plays a key role in the activation of pro-caspase 2, pro-caspase 4 and cathepsin B. Activation of cathepsin B promotes the cleavage/activation of the BH3 domain protein BID. Elevated JNK pathway signaling also activates BAX. Inactivation of the ERK1/2 pathway facilitates activation of BAD and BIM. Thus GST-MDA-7, via PERK signaling, promotes increased activity of at least 4 BH3 domain proteins which all act to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and ultimately promote cell killing.</div></div>
