Zymosan induces autophagy and additionally may induce LC3 translocation to the phagosome (directly or mediated by rapid fusion with LC3-positive autophagic organelles). TLR3 (or RIG-I/MDA5) may activate autophagy upon recognition of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). TLR7 (and TLR8, not shown) induce autophagy. In a viral infection, viral RNA is recognized by TLR7 (endocytic ssRNA) or by RIG-I (short dsRNA or 3′-triphosphate ssRNA). In macrophages, TLR7 ligands induce autophagy, activating the TLR7/MyD88 pathway. In most cells, but not in pDCs, the viral ligands detected by RIG-I induce the IPS-1 pathway (IPS-1 is associated with mitochondria). As a potential negative feedback, Atg5–Atg12 conjugate inhibits this pathway. In pDCs, constitutive autophagy delivers TLR7 ligands from the cytosol to the compartments containing TLR7.</div></div>
