From: An Image Driven Systems Biology Approach for Neurodegenerative Disease Studies in the TSC-mTOR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">This figure illustrates the core TSC-mTor pathway, as discussed in the text. The green signaling path relates to disease such as the Cowden syndrome, Bannayan Riley Rucvalcaba, Proteus syndrome and Lhermitte-Duclos. The purple signaling cascade relates to disease such as Familial cardiac hypertrophy, the Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome and the Peutzâ€“Jeghers syndrome. The blue signaling path relates to the tuberous sclerosis complex disease, affecting multi-organs and often leading to neurologic disorders. The red part is active in different types of cancers including ovarian, gastrointestinal, breast, sporadic and gall bladder and non-small cell carcinoma in the lung. A detailed overview about disease relating to this pathway is given in [6].</div></div>
