From: Interplay between MEK-ERK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>, cyclin D1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulates cell cycle reentry and apoptosis of neurons. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A model for cell cycle reentryâ€“mediated apoptosis. Neurotoxic signals might trigger aberrant activation of the MEK-ERK pathway, resulting in an increase in cyclin D1 levels, which can be by transcription factor STAT3. Cyclin D1 prevents p35-mediated cdk5 activation, which might facilitate the increase in MEK-ERK signaling activity. These events can contribute to cell cycle reentry of neurons, which results in their death.</div></div>
