In addition to ATM/Chk2 and ATR/Chk1 a third DNA damage signaling pathway mediated by p38 MAPK-activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2).

Using Xengraft models Yaffe and colleagues have demonstrated that ATM inhibition can result in either pronounced chemoresistance or chemosensitization to DNA damaging agents. They have demonstrated how DNA damage signaling networks can be rewired and showed how pathway focused diagnostics can be used to successfully predict therapeutic outcomes in cancer treatment.
