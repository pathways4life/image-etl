After 48 h of treatment, cells were assessed for their apoptotic and signaling pathways in gene regulation with commercially available gene array analysis. <b>B,</b> MeWo melanoma cells were exposed to either a dose titration of affinity-purified MDA7/IL-24 or cocultured with MDA7/IL-24–transfected HEK-293 cells. After 48 h of treatment, lysates were taken and proteins were precipitated and washed in 1× PBS, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotted for apoptotic and signaling pathway markers</div></div>
