From: FOXO/4E-BP <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Drosophila Muscles Regulates Organism-wide Proteostasis During Aging. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Muscle aging is characterized by protein damage and accumulation of cytoplasmic aggregates. Loss of protein homeostasis (proteostasis) associates with the progressive decrease in muscle strength and can affect the lifespan of the organism. Pten/FOXO signaling induces multiple targets, including several folding chaperones and the regulator of protein translation 4E-BP. FOXO/4E-BP activity regulates muscle proteostasis at least in part via the autophagy/lysosome pathway of protein degradation, preserves muscle function, and extends lifespan. In addition, FOXO/4E-BP signaling in muscles decreases feeding behavior that, similar to fasting, results in reduced Insulin release from producing cells. This in turn promotes FOXO and 4E-BP activity in other tissues, preserving proteostasis organism-wide and mitigating systemic aging.</div></div>
