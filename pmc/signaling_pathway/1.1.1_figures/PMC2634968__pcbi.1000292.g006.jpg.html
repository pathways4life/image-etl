Uninhibited IL-1 signaling induced formation of a TRAF6/Ajuba/PKCz/SQST1 complex followed by autophosphorylation at the Thr-560 residue of PKCz. This activated complex then signaled downstream to NF-kappa-B via IKK phosphorylation. The three critical network reactions inhibited IL-1 induced NF-kappa-B activation by preventing the formation and subsequent autophosphorylation of the TRAF6/Ajuba/PKCz/SQST1 complex. Unlike inhibitors such as IL-1R2 and soluble IL-1R, which mediate IL-1 signaling by preventing the activation of the IL-1 receptors, the three critical network reactions worked by disrupting other components of the IL-1 DIOS pathway and did not affect the activation of IL-1 receptors.</div></div>
