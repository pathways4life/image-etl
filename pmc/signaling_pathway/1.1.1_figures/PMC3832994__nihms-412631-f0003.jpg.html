Localization of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) in non-stimulated cells (a), in cells stimulated with 1000 ng/mL EGF (b) cells in which EGF signaling was inhibited by 1 μM Tarceva (c), and cells in which PI3K signaling was inhibited by 0.5 μM Wortmannin (d). Localization of phosphorylated pERK in non-stimulated cells (e), in cells stimulated with 1000 ng/mL EGF (F), cells in which EGF signaling was inhibited by 1 μM Tarceva (g), and cells in which PI3K signaling was inhibited by Wortmannin (h). Scale bars, 20 μm. Quantification of pAkt (i) and pERK (j) in non-stimulated cells, cells stimulated with EGF, cells in which EGF signaling was inhibited with Tarceva and cells in which PI3K signaling was inhibited with Wortmannin. * p &lt; 0.05.</div></div>
