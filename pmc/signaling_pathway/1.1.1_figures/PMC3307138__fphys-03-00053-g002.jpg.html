TGF-β inhibits HSC growth by down-regulating c-Myc expression by pSmad2C and pSmad3C pathways (left); TGF-β signaling in turn enhances HSC growth and collagen synthesis via the CDK4-dependent pSmad2L/C and pSmad3L/C pathways induced by PDGF signal (right). However, Smad7 induced by pSmad3L/C signal terminates the fibrogenic phospho-Smad signaling. This negative-feedback mechanism of the fibrogenic TGF-β/PDGF signal results in a transient collagen synthesis in the activated HSC, which may thus contribute to tissue repair. <b>(B)</b> Phospho-Smad signaling involved in fibrogenesis. In MFB, PDGF activates JNK, which phosphorylates Smad2L and Smad3L (left). The JNK-mediated Smad3L phosphorylation leads to hetero-complex of Smad3 with Smad4 in the nucleus where the complex stimulates MFB growth by upregulation of c-Myc transcription. After COOH-tail phosphorylation of cytoplasmic pSmad2L by TGF-β signal, pSmad2L/C translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the pSmad3L and Smad4 complex, which then stimulates plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 transcription (right). In contrast of Smad7 induction in HSC via pSmad3C pathway, pSmad3L cannot induce Smad7 in MFB (left). Under a low level of Smad7, the fibrogenic phospho-Smad signaling can constitutively promote ECM deposition by MFB, which may eventually develop into accelerated liver fibrosis.</div></div>
