The ID is the KEGG ID, pSize indicates the number of genes in the KEGG pathway, NDE is the number of differentially expressed genes found within the pathway and pGFdr is the False Discovery pathways (FDR&lt;0.1). Significant pathways are shown. (B) The differentially expressed genes that account for the significant SPIA pathways (from Figure 2A) are depicted by the heatmap. To the right of the heatmap, the dots indicate the pathways to which each gene contributes and whether a gene is represented by several of the pathways.</div></div>
