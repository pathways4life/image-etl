Phosphorylation of the receptor at tyrosine 1175 causes the recruitment of the adaptor protein Shb, which then activates PI3K. PI3K phosphorylates Akt, which acts through substrates like the actin binding protein Girdin to regulate endothelial cell migration. The Rac1 pathway is shown in green: PI3K also activates Rac1, which regulates migration through the effectors WAVE2 and the actin binding protein Profilin. Phosphorylation of Tyr1175 also causes activation of PLCÎ³, which activates the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA to regulate endothelial cell migration. <b>B: VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling in the nervous system</b>: Many of the same proteins used by VEGFR2 signaling in the vascular system are also implicated to act in the nervous system, but the evidence for this is less clear (indicated by question marks). PI3K inhibitors abrogate VEGFs neuroprotective effect, while PLC and PKC inhibitors prevented the neurotrophic effect exerted by VEGF on cortical neurons.</div></div>
