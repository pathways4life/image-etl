In untransformed, reovirus-resistant cells, double-stranded RNA structures in reovirus transcripts activate PKR, which subsequently phosphorylates eIF-2Î±, inhibiting translation initiation of viral genes. In cells with an activated Ras signaling pathway, however, PKR phosphorylation in response to viral transcripts is inhibited and viral translation proceeds unimpeded.</div></div>
