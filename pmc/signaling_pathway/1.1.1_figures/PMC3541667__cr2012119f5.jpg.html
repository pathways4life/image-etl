From: Histone H3K27me3 demethylases KDM6A and KDM6B modulate definitive endoderm differentiation from human ESCs by regulating WNT <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Hypothetic model explaining how KDM6 may contribute to definitive endoderm differentiation. Treatment of hESCs with activin A causes activation of KDM6A and KDM6B, which can target and remove the H3K27me3 repressive mark leading to upregulation of WNT3. Increased WNT3 causes activation of the WNT pathway and promotes mesendoderm differentiation. At the late stage of endoderm differentiation, WNT antagonist gene DKK1 is activated by KDM6A and KDM6B in a similar fashion to suppress WNT signaling pathway for mesendoderm to definitive endoderm differentiation. ME, mesendoderm; DE, definitive endoderm.</div></div>
