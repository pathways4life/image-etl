Signaling through Dishevelled inhibits GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of b-catenin. Phosphorylation is promoted by two associated proteins, APC and axin. Phosphorylated b-catenin is targeted for degradation. Thus, Wnt ligands act to stabilize the cytoplasmic pool of b-catenin. B-catenin translocates to the cell nucleus where it binds to the TCF family of DNA-binding proteins. This complex activates transcription of genes, including proliferation-promoting genes such as c-jun, cyclin D1 and c-myc. Aqua: activators, red: inhibitors.</div></div>
