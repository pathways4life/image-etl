The pathway is triggered by the Delta-like or Jagged ligands interacting with one or more of the Notch receptors. The pathway is activated by intracellular cleavage of a Notch receptor, releasing the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus where it activates CBF1 (gene symbol, RBPSUH), the primary transcription factor to activate downstream Notch effector pathways (Hes1, 2, 5; Hey1, 2 and L). A variety of transcriptional coactivators and cytoplasmic and nuclear modulators tune the pathway, providing multiple points of control. When Notch signaling is active, differentiation is suppressed. When Notch signaling is turned “off,” differentiation to specific cell fates is allowed to proceed.</div></div>
