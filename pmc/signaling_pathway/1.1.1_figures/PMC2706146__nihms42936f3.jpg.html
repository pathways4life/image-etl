Myostatin appears to induce muscle wasting independent of NF-ÎºB pathway. Increased levels of myostatin blocks myogenesis by downregulating pax3 and myoD expression. In addition, myostatin upregulates proteolysis by phosphorylating FOXO1 through the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Blunt-ended line represents inhibition.</div></div>
