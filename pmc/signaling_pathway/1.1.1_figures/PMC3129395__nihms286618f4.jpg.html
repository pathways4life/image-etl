PV complexes with integrin membrane receptors (e.g., α5β1, see Figure 1B) and actin cytoskeleton to activate signaling via intracellular key regulators, including cSrc and FAK. FAK undergoes autophosphorylation to provide binding motif for c-Src kinase. FAK is further phosphorylated by c-Src to enhance its activity and to recruit downstream adaptors, such as Grb2, for signal transduction. Activated c-Src via increasing phosphorylation subsequently activates the p38 MAPK pathway. Upon activation of both FAK-c-Src and p38 MAPK-ATF2 signaling pathways, the downstream affected genes, such as MMP-9, are therefore transactivated to increase expression and activity. The shown signal transduction pathway, initiated by PV via protein-protein interaction, promotes invasiveness and migration of thyroid cancer cells to undergo distant metastatic spread.</div></div>
