(A) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the NF-κB pathway. (B) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the MAPK signaling pathway. (C) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. (D) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the apoptosis signaling pathway. (E) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the pertussis signaling pathway. (F) Molecular map describing the responses triggered in the legionellosis signaling pathway. IL, interleukin, NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. Activation is reflected as a straight arrow and inhibition is reflected as an inverse ‘T’ shape. Indirect activation is reflected as a dotted arrow and indirect inhibition is reflected as a dotted inverted ‘T’ shape. Dissociation is reflected as equal lines and a missing interaction is reflected as a half arrow. The round-edged rectangle represents a membrane receptor and diamond shapes represent phosphorylation. The ‘V’ shape represents similarities with factors in Table II. The hexagon represents factors found in Fig. 1B, the ellipse with white color represents factors found in Fig. 1C and the octagon represents factors found in both Fig. 1B and C. Round-edged rectangles with white color indicate that both membrane receptor and be found in Fig. 1C and dotted round-edged rectangles indicated that both membrane receptor and be found in Table II. White dotted round-edged rectangles indicate that both membrane receptor and is found in Fig. 1B. Overlapping shapes represent a complex.</div></div>
