From: The Endoplasmic Reticulum Binding Protein BiP Displays Dual Function in Modulating Cell Death Events1[W][OPEN]. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">BiP may modulate the NRP-mediated cell death signaling pathway by inhibiting UPR and stimulating SA signaling. The scheme illustrates the propagation of a cell death signal derived from prolonged ER, osmotic, and biotic stress through the NRP-mediated PCD signaling pathway. A broken arrow indicates an effect on gene expression, while a solid arrow indicates that the gene is an immediate downstream target. This investigation revealed that overexpression of BiP inhibits the UPR, the expression of NRPs, and GmNAC81 and as consequence attenuates cell death mediated by the NRP signaling as in leaf senescence. In response to a biotic stimulus, BiP positively modulates the SA signaling and activates the NRP-mediated cell death signaling.</div></div>
