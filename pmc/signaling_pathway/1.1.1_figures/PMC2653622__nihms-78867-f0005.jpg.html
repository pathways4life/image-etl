For instance, localization of PDGF receptor-αα to the cilium is important for transducing downstream signals mediated by Akt and MAP kinases. The cilium may also normally restrain Wnt pathway activity by preventing the accumulation of β-catenin. The balance of the downstream effects of these pathways likely governs cellular decisions for proliferation and apoptosis.</div></div>
