From: Suberoyl bishydroxamic acid activates Notch1 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and suppresses tumor progression in an animal model of medullary thyroid carcinoma. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">SBHA activates the Notch1 signaling pathway and decreases levels of chromogranin A (CgA). Total tumor tissue extracts were isolated from SBHA-treated or DMSO-treated mice and analyzed by Western blotting for expression of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), achaete-scute complex-like 1 (ASCL1) and CgA. SBHA treatment induced NICD protein, which led to a concomitant decrease in ASCL1, a downstream target of Notch1 signaling, as well as NE tumor marker CgA. G3PDH was used to confirm equal protein loading. The quantification of the bands was generated by comparison with G3PDH.</div></div>
