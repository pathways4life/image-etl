(<b>A</b>) Activation of Erk signaling pathway in cells transfected with AP-2(α+μ2) or CHC siRNAs. BJAB cells, transfected with control, AP-2(α+μ2) or CHC siRNAs, were incubated with Flag-CD95L for the specified times or anti-IgM Fab2′ for 5 min. Cell lysates were analyzed for phospho-Erk1/2 (top) or total Erk1/2 (bottom) expression. Data shown are representative of two experiments. (<b>B</b>) Activation of NF-κB transcription in FynC-GFP-INP54p+ cells. BJAB cells transfected with FynC-GFP-INP54p were analyzed for transcriptional activation of NF-κB following Flag-CD95L, PMA or BCR stimulation. These data are representative of two experiments. (<b>C</b>) Activation of Erk signaling pathways by CD95(Y291F). A20 cells, transfected with wt CD95 or CD95(Y291F), were incubated with anti-hCD95 mAb (CH11) for the specified times. Cell lysates were analyzed for phospho-Erk1/2 (top) or total Erk1/2 (bottom) expression. Cells were also treated with PMA as a positive control.</div></div>
