The causal dependencies between variables assumed in the model are represented by single-headed arrows. Correlations between exogenous variables are represented by double-headed arrows. The numbers on the arrows represent the standardized path coefficients (β). Solid and broken lines represent significant and nonsignificant relationships, respectively.</div></div>
