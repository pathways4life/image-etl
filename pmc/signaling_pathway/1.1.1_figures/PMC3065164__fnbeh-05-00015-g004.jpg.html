From: Dopamine-Mediated Learning and Switching in Cortico-Striatal Circuit Explain Behavioral Changes in Reinforcement Learning. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Simulated neural components of the model performing reward and no-reward trials of 1DR task</b>. In reward trials <b>(A)</b> the reward-category unit (REW category) ramps up its activity shortly after the presentation of the fixation point. The activity shuts off in response to the burst activity of DA unit (DA) signaling the reward value of the target. The FEF unit combines the tonic reward-category activity and the phasic target signal. In the BG, both the direct pathway MSN unit (D1) and the indirect pathway MSN unit (D2) receive an input from the FEF. The direct pathway MSN unit (D1), in addition, receives an input directly from the reward-category unit and therefore shows larger ramping activity than the indirect pathway MSN unit (D2). The activity of the direct pathway MSN unit (D1) is further enhanced by DA-dependent LTP, which is triggered by the DA burst, and mediated by D1 receptors. This results in a stronger disinhibition of the SC by the SNr leading to a stronger activity in the SC. In contrast, the activity of indirect pathway MSN unit (D2) is further depressed by DA-dependent LTD, which is triggered by the DA burst, and mediated by D2 receptors. This results in the suppression of the excitatory input from the STN to the SNr, further enhancing the SC activity. The combined effects from the direct and indirect pathways lead to a shorter latency saccade (see the arrow head on top, indicating the time of saccade initiation). In no-reward trials <b>(B)</b> the activity of the reward-category unit is much weaker, thus lowering the activity of the FEF unit and the direct pathway MSN unit (D1). The activity of the direct pathway MSN unit (D1) is further depressed by DA-independent LTD. In contrast, the activity of D2 MSN increases because DA-dependent LTD is attenuated due to the “pause” of DA activity (DA) and thus is dominated by DA-independent LTP. The combined effects from the direct and indirect pathways lead to a weaker activation of the SC unit and hence a longer latency saccade. The scale of all the ordinate axes is from 0 to 1.</div></div>
