Mutations in PTCH1, SMO, SUFU or amplification of GLI1 have all been reported in human cacners. i. Loss of PTCH1 activity may increase Hh pathway activity. ii. Overexpression or activating mutations in SMO are also depicted. (B) Ligand mediated autocrine signaling. Tumor cells produce Hh ligand that stimulates Hh pathway activity in tumor cells. (C) Ligand mediated paracrine signaling. Non-malignant stromal cells produces Hh ligand required by tumor cells for growth and survival. (D) Ligand mediated paracrine signaling. Tumor cells produce Hh ligand that activates Hh signaling in non-malignant stromal and endothelial cells. This results in the production of unknown factors within the microenvironment that ultimately supports tumor cell growth and survival as well as angiogenesis.</div></div>
