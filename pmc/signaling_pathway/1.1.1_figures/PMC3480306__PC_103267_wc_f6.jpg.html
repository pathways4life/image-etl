New genes identified in this study as acting downstream of the CRE1/RR cytokinin pathway are also indicated: the miR171 h isoform targeting NSP2 and the new direct cytokinin targets bHLH476 and CKX1. Proven interactions are indicated by full lines, and putative interactions by dotted lines.Orange indicates epidermis, green indicates cortex, yellow indicates endodermis, red indicates pericycle, brown indicates stele, and blue indicates nodule primordium.</div></div>
