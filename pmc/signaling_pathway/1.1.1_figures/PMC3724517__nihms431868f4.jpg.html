Ingenuity software was utilized to recognize pathways connecting genes that were differentially expressed in RAF265 responding versus nonresponding patients. A, Pathway analysis of genes involved in cell development and growth regulation that are differentially expressed in BRAFWT responding tumors to RAF265 versus those not responding to RAF265. B, Pathway analysis of genes involved in cell signaling, nucleotide metabolism, and small molecule biochemistry that are differentially expressed in BRAFWT tumors responding to RAF265 versus those not responding to RAF265. C, Pathway analysis of genes involved in cell signaling interactions that are differentially expressed in RAF265 responding versus nonresponding tumors, irrespective of BRAF mutation status.</div></div>
