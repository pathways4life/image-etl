Raf-1 activation decreases the levels of cell–cell contact molecules in MTC cells.

Total ERK1/2 and G3PDH were used to confirm equal protein loading. (A) Treatment of TT-raf cells with E2 led to high levels of phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2, confirming the Raf-1 signaling pathway activation. (B) Treatment of TT-raf cells with E2 resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and occluding.</div></div>
