From: Notch <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> induces EMT in OSCC cell lines in a hypoxic environment. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Following culture under hypoxia or normoxia, invasive cells were stained using Diff-Quik for counting. (B) The ratio of invaded cells was significantly increased by hypoxia compared with that under normoxia in HSC-2, HSC-4 and Ca9-22 cells (*P&lt;0.05). (C) To analyze whether hypoxia enhanced cell invasion through the Notch signaling pathway, cells were cultured with or without 5 μM GSI under hypoxia for 48 h. (D) GSI prevented cell invasion significantly in OSCC cell lines (*P&lt;0.05 and **P&lt;0.01). These findings suggested that hypoxia promoted the invasiveness of OSCC cell lines through the Notch signaling pathway. GSI, γ-secretase inhibitor; OSCC, oral squamous cell carcinoma.</div></div>
