For this analysis, the same lysates were run in parallel on different gels for blotting with the antibodies indicated. (B) Schematic of the PhosphoScan experiment: for each cell line (LNZ308 and LN428) three independent sets of four isolates were prepared (serum starved cells expressing ΔEGFR, ΔEGFR-ki, EGFR and EGFR stimulated with EGF). These were processed for PhosphoScan and analyzed by mass spectrometry.</div></div>
