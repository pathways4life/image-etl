Stimulation of TLRs by ligands leads to the recruitment of adaptor molecules such as MyD88 and TRIF through the interaction of TIR domains, leading to MyD88 dependent and MyD88-independent (TRIF dependent) signaling pathway. The activation of NODs leads to the recruitment of RICK/RIP2 through CARD–CARD interactions, leading to activation of inflammatory signaling pathway. Curcumin, helenalin, cinnamaldehyde, and sulforaphane inhibit TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation by inhibiting TLR4 dimerization. Resveratrol, EGCG, luteolin, quercetin, chrysin, and eriodictyol directly inhibit TBK1 kinase activity. Similarly, curcumin, helenalin and parthenolide also inhibit NOD2 mediated NF-κB activation, presumably through inhibition of NOD2 dimerization.</div></div>
