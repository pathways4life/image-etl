(A)</b> Using signaling pathway cloud regulation for theoretical in silico aging-suppressive drug identification and ranking. The proposed method for identifying and ranking of geroprotective drugs by evaluating the net effect on the many elements of signaling pathway cloud that brings the “old” metabolic state closer to the “young.” <b>(B)</b> An example of how multiple pathways are activated and down-regulated during aging. <b>(C)</b> Pathway Activation Strength (PAS) is the logarithmic additive value that characterizes the up-/downregulation of signaling pathways. <b>(D)</b> Function for the overall signal pathway cloud disturbance outcome (SPCD).</div></div>
