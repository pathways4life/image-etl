From: MUCINS AND TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS: KITH AND KIN IN INFECTION AND CANCER. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The proposed mechanisms of interaction between TLRs and MUCs: I. Ligand-TLR interaction initiates signaling pathways leading to the induction of several pro-inflammatory cytokines MAPKs and NF-ÎºB which are known to induce mucin gene expression. Alternatively these molecules can also induce TLR expression in turn regulating mucin expression thereby forming a self-perpetuating signaling loop. Constitutively active TLR pathways are commonly observed in several cancers.II. Mucins can also activate signaling pathways such as their interaction with receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 and other molecules activates signaling pathways which have common downstream signaling components and lead to a cross-talk with TLR signaling pathway. III. Mucins are large glycoprotein molecules which exhibit the receptor masking and can provide a steric hindrance for endogenous ligand binding to TLRs thus inhibiting their signaling pathway. IV. The sequestration of TLR ligands in the dense mucin matrix can have two possible outcomes either activation or inhibition of TLR signaling pathway. V. Altered glycosylation of mucin molecules can act as a ligand for TLRs and activate TLR signaling pathway.</div></div>
