From: The Casein Kinase I Protein Cck1 Regulates Multiple <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways and Is Essential for Cell Integrity and Fungal Virulence in Cryptococcus neoformans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The proposed model for Cck1 function. In our model, Cck1 regulates multiple downstream pathways and is essential for fungal virulence. Cck1 is regulated by glucose. It may participate in the phosphorylation of Fbp1 substrates to regulate cell integrity and fungal virulence. In addition, Cck1 may also play a more direct role in regulating Mpk1 signaling, or it regulates Mpk1 function via its target protein(s) in the Fbp1 pathway. Meanwhile, Cck1 also responds to stress signals and plays a role in the HOG pathway by regulating the phosphorylation of Hog1 protein and thus controls the cell adaptation to osmotic shock. Cck1 also regulates fungal mating, but its potential target(s) remains to be identified.</div></div>
