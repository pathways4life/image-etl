In this diagram, agonists 1 and 2 both activate receptor G protein-coupling pathways, represented as “Signaling Pathway A.” However, agonist 1 leads to recruitment of β-arrestin but agonist 2 does not. Receptor-β-arrestin interactions can serve to disrupt receptor-G protein coupling and may also serve to facilitate GPCR signaling to alternate pathways such as Signaling Pathway B (Schmid and Bohn, 2010). By not recruiting β-arrestins, agonist 2 activates the receptor without engaging signaling pathway B while allowing signaling pathway A to proceed. Agonist 2 would be considered biased against β-arrestin signaling.</div></div>
