As a result, PLCγ itself is phosphorylated to activate DAG/IP3 signaling (Chen et al., 1996). <b>(2)</b> In the Ras-MAPK pathway, phosphorylated ErbB1 associates with Shc and interacts with Grb2/Sos1. Activated Sos1 triggers GDP/GTP exchange in Ras and activates Ras, driving the sequential kinase reactions of Raf(MAPKKK), MEK(MAPKK), and Erk(MAPK). <b>(3)</b> In the PI3K-Akt pathway, the activated ErbB dimer interacts with Grb2/Gab1 and forms complexes with activated PI3Kinase, leading to the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 and Akt activation. <b>(4)</b> In the JAK-STAT pathway, ErbB kinase phosphorylates and induces JAK to bind to ErbB1. Activated JAK phosphorylates STAT and allows STAT to homodimerize and translocate into the nucleus. Once ErbB4 is phosphorylated by ErbB4, the signaling cascades linked to differentiation become activated, notably the PI3K-Akt pathway and the Ras-MAPK pathway with longer durations.</div></div>
