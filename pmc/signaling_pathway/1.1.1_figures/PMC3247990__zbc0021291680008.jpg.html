From: Nuclear Factor ?B Subunits RelB and cRel Negatively Regulate Toll-like Receptor 3-mediated ?-Interferon Production via Induction of Transcriptional Repressor Protein YY1. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Schematic representation of post-induction repression of IFN-β expression by YY1 in TLR3 signaling pathway.</b> TLR3 is engaged by a dsRNA ligand (e.g. poly(I:C)) promoting activation of the TRIF/TBK1/inducible IκB kinase pathway leading to the binding of IRF3 and IRF7 to the PRD I/III domain of the IFN-β promoter. This results in increased transcriptional activation of the IFN-β gene. TLR3 is a poor activator of the classical NF-κB pathway and especially p65 but can strongly stimulate the nuclear translocation of the Rel subunits RelB and c-Rel followed by induction of YY1. The latter translocates to the nucleus in response to TLR3 signaling, where it displaces IRF7 from the IFN-β promoter resulting in post-induction repression of IFN-β expression.</div></div>
