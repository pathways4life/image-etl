Protein CDC42 (highlighted) was clicked on the diagram [(A2) red rectangle], triggering the highlighting of the corresponding node on the tree (A1), the coloring of all its instances in the diagram (A2 red rectangle) and also the opening of the ‘Details’ panel (showing GO annotations) at the bottom (A4). Additionally, a context-popup-window displays the structure of CDC42 (A3). (<b>B</b>) Multi-pathway view showing the calcium signaling pathway, with the view zoomed in to the Sarcoplasmic region. The pathway from IPAVS curated in the context of cardiac tissue (top) is compared with corresponding pathway from KEGG. The IPAVS pathway shows many more interactions specific to cardiac tissue regulating calcium homeostasis.</div></div>
