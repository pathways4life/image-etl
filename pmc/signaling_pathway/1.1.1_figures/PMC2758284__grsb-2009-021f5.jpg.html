From: A Novel Function of Ethylene. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">By several pharmacological experiments, it has been suggested that protein kinase A (PKA) is involved in the downstream of cAMP as an inhibitory signaling pathway together with calmodulin activated by Ca2+. Lydan and O’Day41 have shown evidence about the role of calmodulin as both a negative (gamete formation) and a positive (cell fusion) regulator of sexual events in Dictyostelium. It is most likely that ZYG1 may be phosphorylated by PKC activated by Ca2+ in the signaling pathway inducing zygote formation.: induction →: inhibition ⫞</div></div>
