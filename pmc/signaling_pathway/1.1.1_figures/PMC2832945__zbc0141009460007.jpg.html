By the addition of U0126, a MAPK selective inhibitor, we observed down-regulation of SREBP-1 expression (see Fig. 6B). In addition, β2M mAb inhibited AR and FAS expression; the latter is known to regulate fatty acid biosynthesis, cell membrane integrity, energy metabolism, and lipid raft-regulated cell signaling (31, 32, 46), which ultimately control prostate cancer cell proliferation, survival, and progression.</div></div>
