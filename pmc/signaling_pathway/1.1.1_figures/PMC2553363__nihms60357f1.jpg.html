The extrinsic pathway is activated by death receptors. Fas or TRAIL (depicted here) bind to their cognate receptors, leading to the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), with caspase 8 activation, Bid cleavage, and subsequent mitochondrial permeabilization. Bim activation can also occur downstream of death receptor signaling, leading to Bax activation and mitochondrial permeabilization. The TNF-Î± signaling pathway also leads to Bid cleavage with lysosomal permeabilization, leading to release of lysosomal contents and mitochondrial permeabilization. The intrinsic pathway of cell death can be initiated by myriad intracellular stressors that can activate the ER stress pathway, lysosomal permeabilization, or JNK activation. These cascades lead to inhibition of the antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-xL, Bcl-2) and activation of the proapoptotic proteins (Bax, Bim, Bad, Bid). Mitochondrial permeabilization occurs eventually and is required for hepatocyte apoptosis.</div></div>
