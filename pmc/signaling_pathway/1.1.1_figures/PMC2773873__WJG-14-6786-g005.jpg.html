From: Dynamic localization of hepatocellular transporters in health and disease. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Signaling pathways involved in the co-stimulation of the canalicular targeting of AE2 and AQP8 by cAMP. AE2 and AQP8 are co-localized in the same population of pericanalicular vesicles, thus explaining common signaling modulation. cAMP stimulates AE2 and AQP8 targeting via activation of PKA. The PI3K pathway mediates the cAMP-stimulated, PKA-dependent targeting of AQP8, and probably that of AE2. cAMP effect on both transporters is counteracted by activation of PKC.</div></div>
