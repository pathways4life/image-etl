IKK may be activated by the TNFα signaling pathway as well as the MyD88-dependent arm of the LPS signaling pathway. IKK leads to NF-κB activity, which is regulated by a negative feedback loop involving IκB (described in detail in Box 1), as depicted in the lower center. TNFα-induced NF-κB activity also leads to A20 expression, and subsequent decrease in IKK activation. Also, the Trif-dependent arm of the LPS-signaling pathway activates the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3), leading to TNFα expression and subsequent autocrine signaling. Thus, A20 and TNF form feedback loops that regulate NF-κB activity.</div></div>
