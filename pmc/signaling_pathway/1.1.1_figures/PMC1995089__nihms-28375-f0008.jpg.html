In wild-type cells (middle), the surface level of Btl/FGFR is modulated by endocytosis via the action of Shi/dynamin, while the stability of Shi/dynamin is regulated by DA, presumably through a DA-receptor mediated signaling event. In Pu or ple mutants (right), or when DA synthesis is blocked by 3-IT, Shi/dynamin level is reduced, resulting in over-accumulation of Btl/FGFR and ectopic migration. In Catsup mutants, or in the presence of exogenously added DA, the level of Shi/dynamin is increased, resulting in down-regulation of surface Btl/FGFR and reduced migration.</div></div>
