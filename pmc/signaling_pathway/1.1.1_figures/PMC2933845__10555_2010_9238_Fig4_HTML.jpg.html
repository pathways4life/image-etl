From: Inhibition of cancer cell invasion and metastasis by genistein. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Genistein inhibits critical pathways in cancer invasion. Our group has demonstrated that genistein can specifically target MEK4. This inhibition results in inactivation of the MEK4 pathway, decreased MMP-2 production, and decreased cell invasion. Genistein also activates Smad1, which is activated by the endoglin signaling pathway, and causes decreased cell invasion. Additionally, genistein inhibits FAK activation, resulting in increased cell adhesion. At this time, it is unclear whether the activation of Smad1 and FAK are due to genisteinâ€™s inhibition of MEK4 or via a different signaling mechanism</div></div>
