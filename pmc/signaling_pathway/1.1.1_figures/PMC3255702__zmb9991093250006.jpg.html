From: TIEG1 Inhibits Breast Cancer Invasion and Metastasis by Inhibition of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Transcription and the EGFR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">TIEG1 inhibits breast cancer cell invasion by inhibition of EGFR signaling pathway. (A) Overexpression of TIEG1 inhibited the EGFR signaling pathway. TIEG1 expression vector or control vector was transfected into MDA-MB-231HM or MDA-MB-468 cells and generated stable transfectants, MDA-MB-231HM/TIEG1 and MDA-MB-231HM/Vector or MDA-MB-468/TIEG1 and MDA-MB-468/Vector, respectively. Western blot analysis was performed as described in Materials and Methods. (B) Knockdown of TIEG1 induced the EGFR signaling pathway. MDA-MB-231 or MCF-7 cells were treated with 100 nM TIEG1 siRNA or nontargeting siRNA for 48 h. Western blot analysis was performed as described in Materials and Methods. (C and D) Expression of TIEG1 inhibited breast cancer cell invasion; overexpression of EGFR restored levels of invaded cells. MDA-MB-231HM/TIEG1 (231HM/TIEG1), MDA-MB-231HM/Vector (231HM/Vector), MDA-MB-468/TIEG1 (468/TIEG1), and MDA-MB-468/Vector (468/Vector) cells, as indicated, were transfected with 2 Î¼g of EGFR expression vector or control vector and analyzed for Matrigel invasion. *, P &lt; 0.01 versus controls. (E and F) Knockdown of TIEG1 promoted cancer cell invasion. MDA-MB-231 cells or MCF-7 cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA (control siRNA) or TIEG1-directed siRNA were analyzed for Matrigel invasion and Western blotting. *, P &lt; 0.01 versus controls. Values in panels C to F indicate invaded cells/mean numbers in five microscope fields.</div></div>
