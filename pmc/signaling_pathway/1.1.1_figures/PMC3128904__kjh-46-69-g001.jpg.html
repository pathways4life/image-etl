Toll-like receptors (TLRs), except for TLR3, use a MyD88-dependent signaling pathway to induce NF-κB activation. TLR3, (and TLR4), on the other hand, can activate MyD88-independent, TRIF-dependent pathway to induce NF-κB or type I interferon (IFN) activation. MyD88 recruits TRAF6 and members of the IRAK family, leading to the activation of the TAK1 complex. The activated TAK1 complex then activates the IKK complex, consisting of IKKα, IKKβ and NEMO (IKK-γ), which catalyze the phosphorylation of IκB proteins. IκBs are degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus. Simultaneously, the TAK1 complex activates the MAPK pathway, which results in the phosphorylation and activation of AP-1. NF-κB and AP-1 control inflammatory responses through the induction of inflammatory cytokines. The signaling cascade triggered by TLR3 uses MyD88-independent, TRIF-dependent pathway. TRIF recruits TRAF3, which then interacts with TBK1 and IKKi. These kinases mediate phosphorylation of IRF3. Phosphorylated IRF3 dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus to regulate transcription. TRIF also interacts with TRAF6 and RIP1, which mediate NF-κB activation. Activation of the IRF3, NF-κB and MAPK pathways results in the induction of type I IFN, particularly IFN-β.</div></div>
