Interactions between PI3K/AKT and other pathways regulate EMT/CSC. MiRNAs function as both upstream mediators and downstream effectors to affect PI3K/AKT pathway activities. References showing the regulatory interactions are indicated. Verified interactions in endometrial cancer were underlined.</div></div>
