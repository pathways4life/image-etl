Out of these, 8 members of core p53 signaling pathway are highlighted as                             red. The shapes on the left indicate the functions and relationships of                             the genes. (B) The biological processes and disease pathways are                             significantly enriched with genes on the DGE list. The yellow line                             indicates the threshold to significance.</div></div>
