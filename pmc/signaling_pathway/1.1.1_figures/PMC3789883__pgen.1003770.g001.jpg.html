Columns left to right: (1) disease; (2) enriched pathway; (3) pathway database, and repository where pathway is retrieved if different from database; (4) BF for hypothesis that disease associations are enriched among SNPs assigned to pathway; (5) posterior probability of enrichment hypothesis; (6) number of genes assigned to pathway; (7) number of SNPs near these genes. Abbreviations used in figure: PID = NCI Nature Pathway Interaction Database [163], BS = NCBI BioSystems [164], PC = Pathway Commons [165]. Databases and database identifiers for pathways listed here: “Transport of connexons to the plasma membrane” (Reactome 11050, PC); “Tumor suppressor Arf inhibits ribosomal biogenesis” (BioCarta); “Cytokine signaling in immune system” (Reactome 75790, BS 366171); “Alanine biosynthesis” (PANTHER P02724); “Measles” (KEGG hsa05162, BS 213306); “IL2-mediated signaling events” (PID il2_1pathway, BS 137976); “Incretin synthesis, secretion, and inactivation” (Reactome 23974, PC). *Null and enrichment hypotheses for RA and T1D include enrichment of disease associations in MHC, in which SNPs within MHC are enriched at a different level than non-MHC SNPs in pathway;  and 4.6 for RA and T1D, respectively. Number of genes/SNPs for RA and T1D count only non-MHC genes assigned to pathway. **Illustrative posterior probability assuming a “conservative” prior (see text).</div></div>
