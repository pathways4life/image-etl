The “stiffest” combination of parameters was associated with the Ras and Raf proteins at the top of the pathway, and in fruit flies Ras and Raf exhibit the least allelic variation of all of the components of the pathway, consistent with the concept that stiff parameter combinations are constrained during evolution. The dotted box indicates that some accessory components of the two cascades are excluded here for clarity of presentation.</div></div>
