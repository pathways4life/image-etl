The broken arrow leading from HYH to the CHS, ELIP1, and CRYD genes indicates that HYH cannot completely compensate for the absence of HY5 in this pathway. The large arrow leading from UV-B to UVR8 overlaps the low fluence and high fluence range, indicating that both high and low UV-B fluence rates can activate UVR8.</div></div>
