Potential mechanisms for regulation of cadherin biology by tyrosine kinase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>.  From: Tissue organization by cadherin adhesion molecules: dynamic molecular and cellular mechanisms of morphogenetic regulation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A) Uncoupling: tyrosine phosphorylation of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail and/or associated proteins dissociates catenins leading to disassembly of the cadherin molecular complex.B) Scaffolding signaling complexes: tyrosine phosphorylation generates binding sites for association of signaling molecules such as C-terminal kinase (CSK, to VE-cadherin cytoplasmic tail) or PTP1B (to Î²-catenin).C) Cadherin-based signaling: recruitment of tyrosine kinases as part of a cadherin signaling pathway mediates control of downstream effectors, such as the cytoskeletal regulator, cortactin.</div></div>
