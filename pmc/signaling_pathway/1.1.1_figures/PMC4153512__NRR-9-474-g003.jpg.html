(B) The reduced release of LDH by geniposide (Gp) is completely inhibited by LY294002. (C) The neuroprotective effect of TLJN is dependent on the MAPK signal-ing pathway. (D) Gp protects cells via the MAPK estrogen signaling pathway. Results are presented as a ratio of control cells (CTRL). All data are expressed as mean ± SD (with each experiment in at least triplicate) and were analyzed either by the one-way analysis of variance or the indepen-dent samples t-test. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, vs. Aβ1–42 group; #P &lt; 0.05, ##P &lt; 0.01, vs. Aβ1–42 + TLJN group; +P &lt; 0.01, vs. Aβ1–42 + E2 group; &amp;P &lt; 0.01, vs. Aβ1–42 + Gp group.
