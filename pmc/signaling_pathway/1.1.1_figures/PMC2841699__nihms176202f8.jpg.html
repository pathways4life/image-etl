Proposed <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> in regulation of ATX expression, LPA production and <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> by VEGF in HUVEC.  From: Autotaxin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> via lysophosphatidic acid receptors contributes to vascular endothelial growth factor-induced endothelial cell migration. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Cancer cells and stromal cells secrete VEGF, which via VEGFR2 stimulates expression of ATX and extracellular LPA production, as well as mRNA levels for LPA1 receptor. The elevated extracellular ATX would increase localized levels of LPA and stimulate LPA signaling, particularly LPA1. Elevated LPA1 signaling, in turn, increases Akt2 mRNA levels. Enhanced expression of Akt2 has been associated with cancer progression, cellular migration and promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.</div></div>
