Hypoxia treatment on endothelial cells (ECs) induced angiogenesis through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)/let-7s/(AGO1)/VEGF signaling pathway. In ECs co-incubated with NSPCs, pro-angiogenic factors released by the NSPCs induced angiogenesis through SMAD2 (SMAD3), and p53/IGF-1R/p-mTOR signaling pathways.</div></div>
