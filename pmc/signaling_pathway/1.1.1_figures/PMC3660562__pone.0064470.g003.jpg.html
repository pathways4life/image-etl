From: Ptc6 Is Required for Proper Rapamycin-Induced Down-Regulation of the Genes Coding for Ribosomal and rRNA Processing Proteins in S. cerevisiae. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A) A simplified model of signaling through the TOR pathway, focused on the regulation of NCR genes and displaying the proposed role for Ptc1 [19]. B) Growth in the presence of the indicated concentrations of rapamycin of diverse mutants in genes involved in the TOR pathway in combination with deletion of PTC6. Relative growth is represented as a percentage respect the growth of each strain in YPD without rapamycin. Six experiments were performed and the mean Â± SEM is represented.</div></div>
