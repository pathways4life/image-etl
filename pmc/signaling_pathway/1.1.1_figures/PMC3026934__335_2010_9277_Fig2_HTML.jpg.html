Upon ligand binding, Dectin-1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src kinases, thereby providing a docking site for Syk which initiates downstream signaling. The downstream signaling is effected by molecules such as CARD9, Bcl10, and MALT1, which lead to NF-κB activation and cytokine production. Dectin-1 can also activate NFAT and noncanonical NF-κB in a CARD9-Bcl10-MALT1-independent manner. Stimulation of Dectin-1 with β-glucans can also induce a second Syk-independent signaling pathway mediated by the serine-threonine kinase Raf-1</div></div>
