From: Serotonin 5-HT3 Receptor-Mediated Vomiting Occurs via the Activation of Ca2+/CaMKII-Dependent ERK1/2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in the Least Shrew (Cryptotis parva). </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">5-HT3R stimulation by the selective agonist 2-Me-5-HT causes an influx of extracellular Ca2+ through 5-HT3Rs/L-type Ca2+ ion channels which increases the free cytoplasmic concentration of Ca2+, thereby promoting Ca2+ release via calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) from the endoplasmic reticulum stores through ryanodine receptors (RyRs). This elevation in cellular Ca2+ level initiates attachment of calmodulin (CaM) with the 5-HT3R, and leads to CaMKIIÎ± activation and subsequent ERK1/2 signaling. The 5-HT3R antagonist palonosetron(1), the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker amlodipine(2), the RyR blocker dantrolene(3), the CaMKII inhibitor KN93(4), and the ERK inhibitor PD98059(5), respectively exhibit anti-emetic efficacy against 2-Me-5-HT-induced vomiting. These findings demonstrate that the 2-Me-5-HT-induced emesis is regulated by 5-HT3R-mediated Ca2+/CaMKII-dependent ERK signaling pathway.</div></div>
