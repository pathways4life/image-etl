Ligation of αvβ3 with multiple ligands (i.e., osteopontin, BSP, or vitronectin) activates FAK, which interacts and activates PI-3 kinase [23]. The products of PI-3 kinase activity recruit PKB/Akt to the cell membrane where it is activated by phosphorylation and it phosphorylates several substrates to elicit a variety of biological responses, including cell survival, adhesion, and migration. Although NF-κB is potentially involved in the αvβ3 signal transduction pathway [8], its role in this signaling pathway is not known for prostate cancer cells.</div></div>
