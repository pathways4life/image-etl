Overexpression of Sprouty2 (Spry2) wt or Spry2 P59A P304A double mutant (unable to bind Grb2) block cyP and FGF-elicited ERK phosphorylation but not Ras activation, probably due to an effect on Raf signaling. However, Spry2 Y55F mutant does not inhibit cyP and FGF-induced ERK pathway activation, although treatment with PGA1 was unable to promote tyrosine-phosphorylation of Spry2; in sharp contrast, RTK activation (mainly EGFR) provokes tyrosine-phosphorylation of Spry2 (at Y55 residue) increasing its binding affinity to the SH2 domain of c-Cbl, which leads to Spry2 ubiquitination.</div></div>
