A: GLP-2 induced mTOR phosphorylation on Ser2448 in a PI3K-dependent manner. PI3K inhibitor LY-294002 (50 μM) not only suppressed basal phosphorylation of mTOR Ser2448 but also abolished GLP-2-induced stimulation (P &lt; 0.01). B: GLP-2 induced p70S6K phosphorylation on Thr389 in a PI3K-dependent manner. LY-294002 (50 μM) not only suppressed basal phosphorylation of p70S6K Thr389 but also abolished GLP-2-induced stimulation (P &lt; 0.01). C: GLP-2 induced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation on Thr37/46 in a PI3K-dependent manner. LY-294002 (50 μM) not only suppressed basal phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 Thr37/46 but also abolished GLP-2-induced stimulation (P &lt; 0.01). HEK 293 cells (transfected with 1 μg GLP-2R cDNA) were treated with 1 or 20 nM GLP-2 for 15 or 30 min in the presence of 0 or 50 μM LY-294002. * and **, Significance at P &lt; 0.05 and 0.01, respectively, vs. control with 0 nM GLP-2 for 0 min.</div></div>
