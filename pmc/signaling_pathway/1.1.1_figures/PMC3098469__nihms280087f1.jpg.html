These signaling pathways control actin polymerization as well as the assembly and activity of myosin II. In the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) pathway, the amount and localization of PIP3 are regulated by PI3Ks and PTEN. This signaling cascade participates in crosstalk with the Ras GTPase-TORC2 pathway by interacting with PI3K-Ras GTPase and activating PKBs. In the Ras GTPase-TORC2 pathway, PKBs generate a negative feedback loop by phosphorylating and inactivating the Sca1 complex (Sca1C). Soluble guanlyl cyclase (sGC) also modulates actin polymerization and myosin II. PLA2A generates a yet-to-be-determined arachidonic acid-related lipid (AARL) as a second messenger.
