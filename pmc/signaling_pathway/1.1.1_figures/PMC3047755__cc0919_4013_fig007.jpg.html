Activation of Shh signaling leads to cell cycle progression via the upregulation/activation of Gli, N-Myc and IRS1. Shh also activates a negative feedback loop through its induction and phosphorylation of βArr1, mediating its nuclear translocation, where it enhances p27 transcription in complex with CREB and p300. This sets the stage for accumulation of p27 to ultimately drive CGNP cell cycle exit.</div></div>
