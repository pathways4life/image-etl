Adolescent chronic alcohol consumption is hypothesized to result in the down regulation of SPIF genes (marked with grey color and solid down arrows), including β1-adrenergic receptor (Adrb1), Gs protein (Gnas), adenylyl cyclase 1 (Adcy1), and dihydropyridine receptor/L-type calcium channel (Cacna1d). The coordinated down regulation of these SPIF genes leads to impaired intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis at the cellular level.</div></div>
