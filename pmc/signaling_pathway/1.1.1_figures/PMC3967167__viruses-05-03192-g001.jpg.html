The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated through receptor-binding (receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), sidled blue line) by growth factors (GF) or cytokines (CY) resulting in phosphorylation of PIP2. PIP3 subsequently serves as a second messenger allowing the binding of pleckstrin homology domain-containing proteins like Akt. Thereby the latter undergoes conformational changes leading to its phosphorylation and activation by PDK1 and mTORC2. Akt finally participates in the regulation of cellular processes like translation, cell growth and apoptosis by phosphorylating further proteins. Termination of the signaling cascade can either occur through the dephosphorylation of PIP3 by the phosphatase PTEN or SHIP, or further downstream through the dephosphorylation of Akt by PHLPP or PP2A.</div></div>
