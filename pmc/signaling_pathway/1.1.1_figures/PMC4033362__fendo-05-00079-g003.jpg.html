Instead of this, IGF-IR linked signaling occurs via its ability to phosphorylate SHPS-1, which results in assembly of a SHPS-1 signaling complex which leads to stimulation of both the PI-3 kinase (“metabolic”) signaling pathway and MAP kinase (“mitogenic”) signaling pathway [Figure modified from Clemmons et al. (32); see also text].</div></div>
