From: Anisotropic regulation of Ankrd2 gene expression in skeletal muscle by mechanical stretch. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic representation of anisotropic regulation of Ankrd2 in the diaphragm muscle. Potential mechanism of activation of two distinct signaling pathways and their involvement in the transcription of Ankrd2 gene. Longitudinal stretch of the diaphragm up-regulates Ankrd2 gene expression via the activation of Akt-dependent NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. Despite activation of Raf-1-dependent AP-1 signaling pathway via the activation of Erk1/2 by either form of stretch, only the transverse stretch-activated Raf-1-dependent AP-1 pathway regulates Ankrd2 gene expression by GTP-Ras, which is activated only by transverse stretch.</div></div>
