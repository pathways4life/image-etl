Effect of edin RNAi on Drosophila immune <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in vitro..  From: Functional Characterization of the Infection-Inducible Peptide Edin in Drosophila melanogaster. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A) Edin RNAi is effective in S2 cells. S2 cells were treated with GFP and edin dsRNA and the cells were induced by adding heat-killed E. coli. Relative expression levels of edin were analyzed from total RNAs with qRT-PCR. n = 4 for each sample. (B) Edin expression is not required for the Imd pathway signaling in vitro. S2 cells were transfected with an Attacin A-luciferase reporter together with GFP (negative control), Relish (positive control) and edin dsRNAs. The Imd pathway was activated by adding heat-killed E. coli to the cell culture medium and samples were collected at indicated time points. Edin RNAi causes a 30% decrease in the Imd pathway activity at the 24 h time point. The data for the 0 h and 24 h time points are pooled from 5 indepent experiments (n = 17 per sample). For 1 h, 4 h and 8 h time points n = 4 per sample. (C) Edin RNAi does not decrease the Imd pathway activity when the pathway is induced with S. marcescens, E. cloacae, peptidoglycan or PGRP-LC. S2 cells were transfected with an AttA-luciferase reporter and edin dsRNA and the Imd pathway was activated with S. marcescens (S.m.), E. cloacae (E.cl.), peptidoglycan (PGN) or a pMT[PGRP-LC] construct. CuSO4 was used to induce the expression of PGRP-LC. GFP and Relish dsRNAs were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Unind. = no induction. The data for S.m., E.cl. and PGN are pooled from 3 independent experiments (n = 12 per sample). For PGRP-LC, n = 3 per sample. (D) Edin RNAi does not affect the Toll pathway activity. S2 cells were transfected with a Drosomycin-luciferase reporter together with GFP, edin and MyD88 (positive control) dsRNAs. A constitutively active form of the Toll receptor, Toll10B, was used to activate the pathway. The data are pooled from 3 independent experiments, n = 10 for each sample. (E) Edin has no effect on the Spätzle-induced Toll-pathway activity. S2 cells were transfected with a Drosomycin-luciferase reporter together with GFP, edin, MyD88 (control) and Cactus (control) dsRNAs. The Toll pathway was activated with the cleaved, active Spätzle ligand (SpzC106). n = 4 for each sample. (F) Edin RNAi has no effect on the JAK/STAT pathway. S2 cells were transfected with a Turandot M-reporter and GFP, STAT (positive control) and edin dsRNAs. The JAK/STAT pathway was activated by overexpressing HopTum-l. n = 4 for each sample.</div></div>
