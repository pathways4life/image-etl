Research to date has identified several factors that contribute to higher levels of STAT5 activation or, conversely, reduce activation levels in normal mammary epithelial cells. E74-like factor 5 (ets domain transcription factor) (ELF5) acts in the PRL/JAK2 signaling pathway to increase levels of STAT5 activation in normal mammary epithelial cells. Other signaling pathway components that increase STAT5 activation are EGF, ErbB2, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), estrogen acting with the progesterone pathway acting downstream, GH/JAK2, IGF, and c-Src. The TGF-β signaling pathway can decrease STAT5 activation levels. Cellular proteins that contribute to increased STAT5 activation include PI 3-kinase enhancer A (PIKE-A), serine/threonine protein kinase Akt 1 (AKT-1), p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1), the phosphotyrosine phosphatase Shp2, beta-integrin, and dystroglycan. Cellular proteins that have been shown to decrease STAT5 activation levels include caveolin-1 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3). c-Src, human cellular-Src; EGF, epidermal growth factor; ErbB4, v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4, neuro/glioblastoma-derived oncogene homolog (avian); GH, growth hormone; IGF, insulin growth factor; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; PRL, prolactin; Shp2, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2; STAT5, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5.</div></div>
