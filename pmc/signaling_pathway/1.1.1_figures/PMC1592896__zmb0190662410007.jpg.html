From: DRONC Coordinates Cell Death and Compensatory Proliferation . </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic diagram showing the proposed signaling cascade that regulates apoptosis and compensatory proliferation. First, apoptotic stimuli given to the cell activates RHG proteins. RHG proteins activate DRONC through inhibition of DIAP1 function. The signaling cascade bifurcates at DRONC, one pathway leading to apoptosis through cleavage of DRICE by DRONC. The other pathway leads to compensatory proliferation through cleavage of an as-yet-unknown factor (denoted as “X”) by DRONC. Cleavage of factor “X” activates JNK signaling, which induces compensatory proliferation through transcriptional upregulation of mitogens including DPP.</div></div>
