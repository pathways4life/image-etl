ABA may be perceived by the receptor (PYR/PYL/RCAR) in the cytosol, leading to activation of SPHK to produce phyto-S1P which initiates a cascade to activate PLDα1. PLDα1 hydrolyzes phospholipids to increase PA level in membrane (plasma membrane and tonoplast). PLDα1-deprived PA promotes the ABA effect through three targets: (i) PA binds to ABI1 and tethers ABI1 to the membrane to inhibit its negative effect; (ii) PA stimulates plasma membrane-localized NADPH oxidase to form secondary messenger: ROS; (iii) Increased PA in tonoplast interacts with SPHK and promotes its activity to form a positive loop. PLDα1/PA- and SPHK/phyto-S1P-mediated signaling pathway activates ion channel activity, leading to ion flux in guard cell and finally stomatal closure. Note that this model summarizes the crosstalk between PLDα1/PA and SPHK/phyto-S1P and their roles in ABA-mediated stomatal closure, not all ABA signaling components are included in this model. Arrow indicates positive regulation, bar indicates repression. Red arrow represents reactions which produce secondary signaling molecules.</div></div>
