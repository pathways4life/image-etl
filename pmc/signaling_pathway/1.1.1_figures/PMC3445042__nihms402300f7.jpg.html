From: Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> regulates post-embryonic hypothalamic progenitor differentiation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model for the role of Wnt signaling in hypothalamic progenitor differentiation. In zebrafish (above), Wnt signaling is active in unspecified embryonic progenitors and Sox3+ post-embryonic neural progenitors, but is lost as these cells undergo neurogenesis. Wnt signaling promotes mitotic activity in progenitors, and is also required for their ability to undergo neuronal differentiation, which underlies the transition from an “uncommitted” to a “committed” progenitor state. Finally, Wnt signaling must be inhibited for differentiation to proceed. In contrast the formation of radial glia is inhibited by Wnt activity. In the adult mouse (below), Wnt signaling is active in ventricular/subventricular zone cells (VZ/SVZ) that express neural progenitor markers, and in parenchymal zone cells that express neuronal and neuronal precursor markers. Ventricular Hes1+ progenitors do not require Wnt activity to make radial glial tanycytes, and ectopic pathway activity inhibits radial glial formation at the expense of other fates.</div></div>
