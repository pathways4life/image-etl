Reperfusion after stroke induced dysfunction of PI3K/Akt pathway and the PI3K/Akt inhibition led to dephosphorylation of PDK1, Akt, and GSK3β degradation, resulting in apoptosis. However, XXMD treatment inhibited apoptosis of different cells in NVU and increased expression levels of p-PTEN, p-PDK1, p-Akt, and p-GSK3β. Furthermore, PI3K/Akt pathway is associated with Ras/MAPK pathway. In the present study, we also found that XXMD upregulated the level of p-c-raf. Above all, all the observations in the study indicated that XXMD may exert its NVU protection partly through the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.</div></div>
