In STC-1 cells, activation of Gs-coupled TGR5 receptors by OA causes stimulation of PI hydrolysis, and release of GLP-1 and PYY via a PKA-independent, cAMP-dependent mechanism involving Epac/PLC-Îµ/Ca2+ pathway. H2S inhibits GLP-1 and PYY release by inhibiting PI hydrolysis and Ca2+ release.</div></div>
