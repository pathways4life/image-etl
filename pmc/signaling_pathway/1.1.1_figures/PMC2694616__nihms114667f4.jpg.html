The Rb/E2F pathway regulates genes and processes in S phase and mitosis.B. Three signatures derived from the Rb/E2F pathway are significantly associated with specific phases of the cell cycle. In this figure, the signatures are produced from the E2F pathway. The scatter plots show the relationship between the scores of signatures 3, 4, 6 and drugs that target events in S phase and mitosis of the cell cycle. The GI50 and red regression lines are defined as in Figure 2B. Here, signature 3 is significantly associated with three drugs that target aspects of S phase (Supplemental Table S3), and not associated with drugs that target mitosis. Furthermore, high scores for signature 3 is associated with mutations in p16, an inhibitor of S phase activities. Conversely, signatures 4 and 6 are associated with mitosis but not S phase.</div></div>
