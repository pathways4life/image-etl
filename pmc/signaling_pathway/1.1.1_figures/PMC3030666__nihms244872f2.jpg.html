Age-associated alterations in <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways in DCs impacting their functions.  From: Impact of Aging on Dendritic Cell Functions in humans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>A. Pathogens:</b> Figure depicts age-associated changes in signaling mechanisms leading to increased cytokine secretion in response to pathogens and decreased phagocytosis and migration of DCs. Increased basal expression of PTEN results in inhibition of activation of AKT kinase of PI3kinase signaling pathway. Reduced AKT phosphorylation functions as a positive regulator for TLR signaling leading to increased activation of p38 MAP kinase and NFκB which in turn result in increased proinflammatory cytokine secretion and inflammation. Reduced activation of AKT however inhibits phagocytosis and migration of DCs. <b>B. Self Antigens:</b> Figure depicts age-associated changes in signaling mechanisms leading to increased reactivity of DCs to self- antigens such as DNA. Increased basal level activation of NFκB leads to semi-maturation of DCs which results in enhanced response to self antigens and subsequent inflammation.</div></div>
