Blastocysts were treated with vehicle (Control), 10 μM U73343, 10 μM U73122 or 1 μM Xestospongin C and then exposed to FN-120. Intracellular Ca2+ levels (A) were monitored and reported as in Fig. 1 and ΔFN-binding activities (B) were normalized to the Control group and reported as mean ± SEM. *, P &lt; 0.05, compared to Control.</div></div>
