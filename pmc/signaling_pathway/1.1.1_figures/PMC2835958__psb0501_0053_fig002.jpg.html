From: Arabidopsis SUMO E3 ligase AtMMS21 regulates root meristem development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model of AtMM S21 function in root meristem development. AtMM S21 acts as a node element of cytokinin and auxin interaction. It plays role positively in the PLTs-mediated auxin signaling pathway to promote the root meristem cell division on one hand.18 AtMM S21 is inhibited by cytokinin to modulate the root meristem cell differenciation on the other hand.17 AtMM S21 also may stimulate cytokinin signaling by inducing the expression of CRE1 and ARRs genes to sustaining the homeostasis between cytokinin and auxin signaling in the progress of root meristem development.</div></div>
