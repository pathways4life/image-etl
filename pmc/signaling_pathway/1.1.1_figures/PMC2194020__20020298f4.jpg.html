From: Constitutive Expression of the B7h Ligand for Inducible Costimulator on Naive B Cells Is Extinguished after Activation by Distinct B Cell Receptor and Interleukin 4 Receptor-mediated Pathways and Can Be Rescued by CD40 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">BCR-mediated B7h down-regulation occurs through Ca2+ signaling, whereas IL-4–mediated down-regulation occurs through a distinct Stat6-dependent signaling pathway. (A) B7h down-regulation induced by BCR signaling is Ca2+ dependent. Purified B cells were treated for 24h with PMA alone, ionomycin alone, or a combination of both and stained for B7h expression. (B) B7h down-regulation by BCR signaling is CsA sensitive. Purified B cells were activated with PMA and ionomycin, anti-IgM F(ab′)2, IL-4, or untreated either in the presence (solid lines) or absence (solid filled) of CsA. After 24 h of stimulation, cells were stained for B7h expression compared with control staining (shaded histogram). (C) IL-4–mediated B7h down-regulation is Stat-6 dependent. Purified B cells from Stat6−/− and wild-type control mice were either untreated or activated with IL-4, anti-IgM F(ab′)2 and IL-4, or PMA and ionomycin. Cells were stained for B7h expression after 24 h of culture.</div></div>
