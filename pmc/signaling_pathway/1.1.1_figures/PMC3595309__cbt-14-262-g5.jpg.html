Coupling CDH17 activates the IKK complex, which subsequently phosphorylates the IκB-α. Then the phosphorylated IκB-α undergoes proteasome-dependent decomposition, which releases the heterodimers of p65/p50 into cytoplasm and transferred into the nucleus. Finally, the p65 binds to its responsive gene and promotes the transcription of downstream proteins including VEGF-C and MMP-9. On the other hand, RNAi mediated inhibition of CDH17 attenuates the activation of NFκB in gastric cancer cells, leading to a concomitant reduction in downstream proteins.</div></div>
