(A)</b> RAW264.7 cells were infected with BCG at MOI of 10 for indicated time, then they were used for intracellular ROS measurement by a flow cytometry assay. A time-dependent ROS production was observed within 6 h. <b>(B)</b> RAW264.7 cells were infected with indicated doses of BCG for 6 h prior to be used for examination of intracellular ROS by a flow cytometry assay. A BCG dose-dependent ROS production was observed. <b>(C)</b> Impact of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on BCG-induced ROS production in RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells were infected with BCG at MOI of 10 for 6 h prior to be used for measuring intracellular ROS by a flow cytometry assay. An activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling exhibited an ability to reduce BCG-induced ROS production. <b>(D)</b> Impact of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on oxidative stress in RAW264.7 cells. RAW264.7 cells were exposed to 500 μmol/L of H2O2 for 6 h before they were harvested for intracellular ROS measurement. The addition of Wnt3a showed a capacity to scavenge oxidative stressed-ROS accumulation.</div></div>
