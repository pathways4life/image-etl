Wnt signaling can be broadly divided into two categories: canonical, β-catenin dependent signaling and non-canonical, β-catenin independent signaling. The most well characterized of the non-canonical signals are the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway and Wnt/Ca + 2 pathway. PCP and Wnt/Ca signaling have been shown to regulate cell migration</div></div>
