The results were expressed as absorbance ratio of mRNA expression on day 10 or 20 to that of the neural stem/progenitor cell stage, which was assigned a value of 1 (mean ± SD, n = 4).FGF: Fibroblast growth factor; FGFR: fibroblast growth factor receptor; NSCs/NPCs: neural stem/progenitor cells.</div></div>
