Tissues were obtained from untreated mice (UT) or from eCG-primed mice before (0 h) or after injection of hCG. Total RNA was assayed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Data are mean Â± sem; n = 3 granulosa cell and residual tissue preparations. Bars without common superscripts are significantly different (P &lt; 0.05).</div></div>
