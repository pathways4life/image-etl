(A and B) JAK/STAT pathway activity as indicated by the 6×2xDrafLuc reporter in cells treated with dsRNAs targeting the indicated genes in different combinations. Individual genes were targeted by the same quantity of dsRNA, with the total amount of dsRNA kept constant by the addition of control dsRNA. Cells were treated with Upd2-GFP–conditioned (A) or mock-conditioned (B) media, and pathway activity was measured using the 6×2xDrafLuc reporter. Significance is shown for selected combinations with ***, p &lt; 0.0001, **, p &lt; 0.001, *, p &lt; 0.05.</div></div>
