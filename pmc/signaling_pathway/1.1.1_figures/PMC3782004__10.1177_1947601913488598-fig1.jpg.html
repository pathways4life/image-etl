HER2 activates 2 major signaling pathways (ERK and AKT) that utilize transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms to inhibit the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. The network dynamics are illustrated before the addition of lapatinib (<b>A</b>) and after the addition of the drug (<b>B</b>). These interactions are supported by the literature, but the true complexity of this interface is likely much greater.</div></div>
