PI3K signaling is negatively regulated by SHIP, PTEN, LAX, and RGS13. Ras signaling is negatively regulated by RasGAP. Cell surface proteins that negatively regulate FcϵRI signaling include TRPM4, which reduces calcium signaling, and TLR4, which, upon formation of a complex with the ES62 product of filarial nematodes, inhibits SphK and PLD signaling by sequestering and degrading SphK- and PLD-activating PKCα. Co-cross-linking of the ITIM-containing cell surface receptor FcγRIIb with FcϵRI triggers the inhibition of FcϵRI signaling at several points, including SHIP-mediated inactivation of PI3K signaling and DOK1/RasGAP-mediated inactivation of Ras signaling. Co-cross-linking of FcϵRI with other ITIM-containing cell surface receptors triggers the inhibition of FcϵRI signaling mediated by SHP-1 and SHP-2.
