A,  Feed-forward regulation of ABA signaling mediated by VP1 is mediated by the  pathway proposed by Finkelstein and colleagues  (Finkelstein and Lynch, 2000;  Soderman et al., 2000). In  addition, ABA induces two negative regulators of ABA signaling, ABI1  and ABI2, enabling feedback regulation of ABA signaling  (Leung et al., 1997;  Gosti et al., 1999;  Merlot et al., 2001). These  signaling pathways are shown with dotted lines. VP1 inhibits ABA induction of  the negative regulators, potentiating further enhancement of ABA sensitivity  (shown with bold line). B, Northern analysis of ABI1, ABI2,  and ABI5 gene expression in maturing siliques of wild type  (Col) and abi3-6. Total RNA samples were isolated from the  late stage of developing siliques. Fifteen micrograms of the total RNA was  hybridized with the indicated probes.</div></div>
