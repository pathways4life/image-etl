In contrast, both S1P1  and S1P2 subtypes of S1P family receptors are up-regulated in  senescent ECs. The increased expression of S1P2 antagonizes the  “stimulatory” signaling mediated by S1P/S1P1 pathway  via elevating cellular PTEN phosphatase activity. The S1P2-mediated  PTEN activation results in the inactivation of Rac GTPase, which ultimately  inhibits the integrin αvβ3 activation,  migratory, wound-healing, and morphogenetic capabilities in senescent ECs.</div></div>
