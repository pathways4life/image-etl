(A) KSR1−/− MEFs stably expressing the indicated KSR1 proteins were serum starved and treated with EGF. Pyo-KSR1 proteins were immunoprecipitated and examined for binding of endogenous B-Raf and MEK proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFr indicates activation of EGFr pathway signaling. (B) Serum-starved WT- or AxAP-KSR1 MEFs were treated as indicated using EGF and U0126. Pyo-KSR1 proteins were immunoprecipitated and examined for binding of endogenous B-Raf, MEK, and pERK. Lysates were probed for pERK levels to confirm that U0126 blocked ERK activation.</div></div>
