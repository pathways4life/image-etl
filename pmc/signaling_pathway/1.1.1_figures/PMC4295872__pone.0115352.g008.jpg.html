Mechanistic model of PSMC3IP and EPSTI1 as putative apoptotic factors..  From: Breast Cancer Genes PSMC3IP and EPSTI1 Play a Role in Apoptosis Regulation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The extrinsic apoptosis pathway is initiated by the ligand binding to the death receptor, forming the DISC complex and leading to the activation of the caspase signaling cascade. The overexpression of EGFR and HER2 or activation of components of their downstream signaling pathways (i.e. PI3K pathway) induce an anti-apoptotic signaling through PI3K-Akt pathway in endocrine resistant breast cancer cells. Based on our findings, we suggest that PSMC3IP and EPSTI1 may regulate the apoptotic pathway via the physical interaction mainly with the apoptosis initiator CASP8, but also with AKT1 and BCAR3. Pro-apoptotic proteins are displayed in red and anti-apoptotic in green. Candidate proteins are displayed in purple.</div></div>
