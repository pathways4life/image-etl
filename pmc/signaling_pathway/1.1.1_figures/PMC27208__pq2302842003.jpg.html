From: ROP-1, an RNA quality-control <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> component, affects  Caenorhabditis elegans dauer formation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for the interaction of ROP-1 with components of the  dauer formation pathway. ROP-1 modulates the activity of components in  both the daf-2 and daf-7 pathways to  influence dauer formation signaling. Favorable growth conditions allow  a signal from daf-2 (and maybe also  daf-7) to activate an aspartic proteinase. This  proteinase in turn catalyses the processing of ROP-1, which relieves  its influence on both signaling pathways. This processing allows ROP-1  to perform another set of activities, possibly also related to RNA  degradation as part of its RNA quality control function(s).</div></div>
