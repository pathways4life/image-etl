Left: cardiac dysfunction: signaling diagram for AC5 regulation of MnSOD transcriptionally through the sirtuin 1/forkhead box O3a (SIRT1/FoxO3a) pathway is shown. Imbalance between reactive oxygen species production and the intracellular antioxidant system results in the intolerance of AC5-Tg to stress (41). Right: longevity: disruption of AC5 activates the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. The activation of ERK activates antioxidative stress and cell survival mechanism, which leads to longevity in AC5-KO mice (85). Arrows indicate the direction of signaling.
