Cell lysates were collected and subject to Western blot. FM, full medium. B, MEFs were treated with BSA control or PA (0.25 mm) for 4 h in full medium. Cells were also treated with EBSS and the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (20 nm), for 4 h as positive controls. CQ (10 Î¼m) was added to the treated cells for measuring autophagic flux.</div></div>
