A. Primary cortical neurons (10 DIV) were pre-treated with vehicle (Control) or 20 μM PD98059 (PD98) for 30 min, and then stimulated with 50 μΜ NMDA for 15 min. Wnt5a protein was measured by Western blotting and quantified data were presented in graphs (mean ± SEM; n = 3, *p &lt; 0.05; One-way ANOVA). B. Primary cortical neurons (10 DIV) were pre-treated with vehicle (Control) or 20 μM U0126 for 30 min, followed by 50 μΜ NMDA for 15 min. Graphs (mean ± SEM) are from three independent experiments (*, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; One-way ANOVA).</div></div>
