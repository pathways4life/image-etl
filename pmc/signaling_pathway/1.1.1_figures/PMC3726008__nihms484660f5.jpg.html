From: A Systems-Based Approach to Investigate Dose- and Time-Dependent Methylmercury-Induced Gene Expression Response in C57BL/6 Mouse Embryos Undergoing Neurulation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Dose-dependent MeHg-induced gene expression alterations within the Wnt-signaling pathway. The degree of impact by MeHg is displayed in genes identified to be significantly altered by MeHg (ANOVA, P&lt;0.0005) and linked with the Wnt Signaling Pathway (Dennis et al., 2003). Each gene is color coded based on fold change of response (log 2 scale) for each gene with 1, 4, and 6 mg/kg BW MeHg, respectively. Only fold change values associated with 8 h exposure data are displayed. Fold change values are not present for genes identified to be not significantly altered by MeHg. Pathways were generated via the Wnt-signaling pathway (http://www.genome.jp/) with modifications, including the addition of genes, Wnt5a and Celsr1 to the Non-Canonical Wnt-signaling pathway due to recent studies suggesting an important role in activation of this pathway (Montcouquiol, 2007; Montcouquiol et al., 2006, 2008; Qian et al., 2007; Tissir and Goffinet, 2006; Zhou et al., 2007). The Wnt-signaling pathway represented the most enriched KEGG pathway within genes significantly altered by MeHg.</div></div>
