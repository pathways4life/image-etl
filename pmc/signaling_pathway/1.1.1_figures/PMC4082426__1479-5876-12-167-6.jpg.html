A</b>, The mRNA expression of inhibitors and downstream genes of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was measured by RT-PCR in control cultures, DAC treated cultures, IDA treated cultures and DAC followed by IDA treated cultures in the U937, HEL and SKM-1 cell lines. Expression was normalized in comparison with control cultures. The mean ± SD of four different experiments is shown. Statistical differences were calculated by one-way ANOVA. *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001. <b>B</b>, Western blot analyze the protein expression of inhibitors and downstream genes of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in four cultures of AML cell lines and tumor cells from AML mouse model. <b>C</b>, Immunohistochemistry for β-catenin in tumor tissues of subcutaneous AML mouse model. β-catenin expression was more frequently observed in group treated with DAC combining with IDA than treated with DAC or IDA alone.</div></div>
