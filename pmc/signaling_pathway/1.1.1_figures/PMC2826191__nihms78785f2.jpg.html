From: Spatial Segregation of Ras <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Spatial segregation of S. pombe Ras1 pathways. The Ras1-Byr2 (MAP kinase) pathway signals from the PM to mediate cross-membrane signaling during mating. The Ras1-Scd1 (Cdc42) pathway regulates uncharacterized intracellular signals to control protein trafficking. Each Ras1 pathway is specifically activated by a GEF. The Ras1-Byr2 pathway is regulated by Ste6, while Efc25 selectively regulates the Ras1-Scd1 pathway. The farnesyl modification is indicated with a branched, unsaturated polyisoprene chain while palmitoylation is indicated with an acyl chain.</div></div>
