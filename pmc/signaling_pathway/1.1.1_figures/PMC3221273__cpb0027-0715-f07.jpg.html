From: Polycystin-1, 2, and STIM1 Interact with IP3R to Modulate ER Ca2+ Release through the PI3K/Akt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model. A. In the cell without PC1 expression, the PI3K/Akt pathway is not active, and PC2 is retained in the ER. Extracellular signals that activate the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway induce production of IP3 to activate the IP3R. Activation of the IP3R releases Ca2+ from within the ER to cytosol. PC2, which is retained in the ER interacts with IP3R and facilitates the release of Ca2+. Enhancement of Ca2+ release by PC2-IP3R interaction eventually leads to Ca2+ depletion in the ER and activation of the store-operated Ca2+ influx (SOC). Blue arrow represents Ca2+ movement, and orange arrow represents activation of inhibition (arrow with flat head) of cellular activities. B. In the cell with PC1 expression, the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated. This signaling pathway leads to an increase of STIM1-IP3R complex, reduction of the PC2-IP3R interaction in the ER, and probably translocation of PC2 from the ER to the plasma membrane. PC2 interacts with PC1 at the plasma membrane to serve as a Ca2+ influx channel. Extracellular signals that activate the PLC pathway induce production of IP3 to activate the IP3R. Activation of the IP3R will stimulate Ca2+ release, however, reduction of the PC2-IP3R interaction and increased the association of STIM1-IP3R inhibit release of intracellular Ca2+ that eventually keeps the Ca2+ level within the ER high, and therefore inactivate the SOC.</div></div>
