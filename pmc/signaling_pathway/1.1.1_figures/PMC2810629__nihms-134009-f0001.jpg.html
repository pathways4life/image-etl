In the canonical pathway, activated type I receptors phosphorylates R-Smads, which subsequently form a complex with the Co-Smad, Smad4. The resulting R-Smads/Co-Smad complex translocates to the nucleus and interacts with distinct transcription factors to turn on or off transcription of many TGFβ-responsive genes that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Additionally, TGFβ activates different non-Smad pathways, including PI3K, Ras, Par6, Jnk/p38/MAPK pathways, which cumulatively regulate TGFβ-mediated functions.</div></div>
