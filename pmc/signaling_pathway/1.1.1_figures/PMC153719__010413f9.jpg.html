From: Dominant-Negative Receptor Uncovers Redundancy in the Arabidopsis ERECTA Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor-Like Kinase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> That Regulates Organ Shape. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Hypothetical Model for the ERECTA Signaling Pathway and ΔKinase Action.<b>(A)</b> In wild-type plants, ERECTA associates with multiple partners (orange). Additional RLKs (blue) may share ligands (red) as well as receptor partners of ERECTA. The activation of these pathways promotes internode/organ elongation.<b>(B)</b> erecta-105 plants do not have any ERECT. However, the receptor complex with overlapping function partially promotes internode/organ elongation.<b>(C)</b> In ERECTA::ΔKinase/erecta-105 plants, highly stable ERECTA ΔKinase fragments shut down the entire pathway, presumably by forming inactive receptor heterodimers and/or depleting ligands for the RLK that has a function partially redundant with that of ERECTA.</div></div>
