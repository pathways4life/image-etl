Upon damage, the Hippo pathway ligand, Ds, no longer activates Hippo signaling in ISCs, allowing Yki to activate downstream targets. One of these targets is the Upd/Os cytokine, which stimulates proliferation of ISCs/Ebs through the JAK/STAT pathway. When ee and EC progeny are regenerated, Hippo signaling acts as a brake, cytokine production slows and the system returns to the homeostatic state.</div></div>
