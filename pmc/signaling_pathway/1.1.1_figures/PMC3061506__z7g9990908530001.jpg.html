Using the bioinformatics analysis tools (Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base), the TLR signaling pathway was defined among the canonical pathways significantly associated with our high-throughput human proteomic data (right-tailed Fisher's exact test; P &lt; 0.05). Proteins shown in blue are those identified by the LC-MS/MS analysis of human retinal proteins, which exhibited an upregulation or were detectable only in glaucomatous samples (detailed information for abbreviated proteins is available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein).</div></div>
