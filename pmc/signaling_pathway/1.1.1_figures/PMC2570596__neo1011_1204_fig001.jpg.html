The Hippo pathway is an evolutionary conserved cellular pathway that coordinately regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. Merlin has been proposed to interact with unknown membrane proteins and transduce a signal that stimulates the phosphorylation of LATS1/2 by the serine/threonine kinases MST1/2 that interact with hWW45. LATS1/2 inhibits the transcriptional coactivator YAP resulting in suppressed expression of downstream target genes such as cyclins that are involved in cell growth and proliferation.</div></div>
