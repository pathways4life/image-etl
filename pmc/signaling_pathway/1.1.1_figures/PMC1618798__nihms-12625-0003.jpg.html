(A) Depiction of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. The four major apoptosis-inducing death receptors are activated when Fas ligand (FasL) activates Fas, TRAIL activates DR4 or DR5, or TNF activates TNF-R1 (left inset). The binding of the ligand to the death receptor induces trimerization of the receptor which produces a conformation that recruits FADD and procaspase-8 to the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor, altogether forming a protein complex known as the DISC. Within the DISC, caspase-8 is activated by auto-cleavage. In type I cells, sufficient active caspase-8 is generated to directly activate caspase-3 to carry out the apoptotic program. In type II cells, activation of caspase-8 leads to activation of caspase-3 indirectly through cleavage and activation of Bid, forming tBid, which activates the mitochondrial apoptotic mechanisms that are involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. (B) GSK3 inhibits the extrinsic apoptotic pathway by impairing transduction of the signal from activated death receptors to the activation of caspase-8.</div></div>
