Hormone-depleted MCF-7 cells were transfected with siRNA against RET/PTC kinase or siRNA against luciferase for 36h. Then cells were switched into serum free IMEM with E2 or vehicle for 24h. Before harvesting, cells were treated with physiological level (1ng/ml) of the RET/PTC kinase ligand glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) for 10min to stimulate the RET/PTC kinase signaling pathway. Western blot analysis of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated kinase signaling pathway components is shown.</div></div>
