From: Telomerase Inhibition Decreases Alpha-Fetoprotein Expression and Secretion by Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Lines: In Vitro and In Vivo Study. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Our study demonstrates that the inhibition of telomerase, PKC and the PI3k/Akt/mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathway leads to decreases in AFP expression and secretion. In contrast, the inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway did not show any effect. However, the combination of a telomerase inhibitor with other pathway inhibitors (see results section) presented an additive effect with costunolide. The mechanism underlying the action of telomerase remains unclear. The modulation of AFP by telomerase may be either through the PI3k/Akt/mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathway or through an independent pathway. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the modulation of AFP by telomerase.</div></div>
