(A) Western blot of p-ERM and ERM protein levels among +/+ and −/− lungs at E18.5. β-Actin and α-tubulin are shown as loading controls. Samples were run on nonadjacent lanes of the same gel. (B) Frozen sections from E18.5 +/+ and −/− mouse lungs were stained for Yap1 (transcription factor downstream of Hippo pathway) (×600; zoom, 3). (C) Western blot of p-Yap1 (Hippo pathway activation) and Hes1 (Notch pathway activation) among +/+ and −/− lungs at E18.5. α-Tubulin is shown as the loading control. Samples were run on nonadjacent lanes of the same gel.</div></div>
