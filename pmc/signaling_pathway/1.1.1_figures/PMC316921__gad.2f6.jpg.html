The Wnt pathway in the early C. elegans embryo (B) is contrasted to the ‘canonical’ pathway derived from experimental data from other organisms (A; see Cadigan and Nusse 1997). In this diagram, the signaling cell is drawn above the responding cell. As shown in B, Wnt signaling is required for both EMS mitotic spindle orientation (left) and endoderm specification (right), although there may be separate signaling ligands for these two processes (Rocheleau et al. 1997; Thorpe et al. 1997; A. Schlesinger et al., unpubl.). gsk-3 may represent a branchpoint in the EMS Wnt pathway, regulating both endoderm induction and mitotic spindle orientation. Not depicted but also possible are arrows from gsk-3 directly to the EMS spindle, and directly to the cytoskeleton during endoderm induction. In contrast to the roles of pan and LEF-1, which are converted into activators by Wnt signaling, pop-1 acts purely as a repressor in the C. elegans pathway (Cadigan and Nusse 1997). Release from POP-1-mediated repression of endoderm occurs not in EMS but in its posterior daughter, E.</div></div>
