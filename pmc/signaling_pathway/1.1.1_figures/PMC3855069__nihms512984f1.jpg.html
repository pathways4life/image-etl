IL-11 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> promotes gastrointestinal tumorigenesis.  From: IL-11: a prominent pro-tumorigenic member of IL-6 family. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>A)</b>Putoczki et al. study demonstrates the dominant importance of IL-11-gp130 signaling in models of CAC, CRC and GC. When models with the wild type gp130 are used, both IL-6 and IL-11 are required for tumor development. When models with the gp130Y757F mutant are used (indicated with a ‘red star’), the tumorigenesis is solely dependent on IL-11. IL-11-gp130 signaling is required for enhanced cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis.<b>B)</b>Although STAT3 pathway is important to mediate effects of IL-11 signaling, gp130 is known to also regulate the mTORC1 pathway and the Ras/ERK pathway. The contribution of the mTORC1 pathway in GC and in CAC has been previously demonstrated, IL-6 and IL-11 mostly activate an overlapping set of genes in cancer, with only a few of them being more specific for IL-6 or for IL-11.</div></div>
