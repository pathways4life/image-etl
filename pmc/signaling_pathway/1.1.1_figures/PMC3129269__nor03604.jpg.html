From: The Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) is targeted in glioblastoma and has a tumor suppressing function potentially by induction of senescence. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">LN319 cell clones stably transfected with WIF1 show reduced Wnt pathway signaling. Two stably transfected LN319 clones were analyzed for WIF1 expression by qRT-PCR (normalized to the control cells transfected with the empty vector, pcDNA3.1) (A) and WIF1 secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (B). Wnt pathway signaling was measured both with the TCF luciferase reporter (TOP5/FOP5) and normalized to the control cells (C) and by measuring AXIN2 mRNA expression (D). The specificity of the WIF1-induced effects in the 2 clones was controlled by transfection of specific siRNAs against WIF1 or a respective scrambled control. Wnt pathway signaling was measured using the TCF reporter (E) and WIF1 secretion using ELISA (F). Results are marked with 1 asterisk (*) if P&lt; .05 and 2 (**) if P &lt; .01.</div></div>
