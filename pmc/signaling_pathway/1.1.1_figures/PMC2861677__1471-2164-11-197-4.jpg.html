The directional regulation of 14 major KEGG pathways (number of up- minus down-regulated genes in a given KEGG pathway normalized to the total number of regulated genes within a study) was color-coded with yellow and blue representing low and high expression of the pathways, respectively. The cellular pathways of "protein export", "cell cycle" and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis" were positively correlated with OXPHOS, while "calcium-mediated signaling", and structural components important for cell-cell contact (e.g. "cell adhesion molecules", "tight junctions", "gap junctions", "adherens junctions") were negatively correlated with OXPHOS.</div></div>
