As selected from Table 5, these pathways are CD40 Signaling (<b>A</b>), IL-1 Signaling (<b>B</b>), and Chemokine Signaling (<b>C</b>). Molecules are indicated by standard abbreviations. Relative changes in gene expression are depicted by gradated shades of color coding: red, up; green, down; white, no change or not applicable. Direct and indirect interactions between molecules are depicted by solid and dotted lines, respectively.</div></div>
