Treatment of HL-1 monolayers with media obtained from Wnt3a overexpressing L1 cells significantly increased the θ after 4 h (A; *P &lt; 0.05 compared with Ctrl). PD98058, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, attenuated the ConT-mediated increase of θ in HL-1 monolayers (B; *P &lt; 0.05 compared with Ctrl; &amp;P &lt; 0.05 compared with Ctrl + PD98059; #P &lt; 0.05 compared with ConT). A schematic summary of the experimental results illustrates the proposed signal transduction pathway (C). RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.</div></div>
