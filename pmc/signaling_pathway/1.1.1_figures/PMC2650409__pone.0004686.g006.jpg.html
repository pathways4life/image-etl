Model of upstream activation of Akt by ghrelin..

Akt translocates to the plasma membrane by binding to PIP3 where it is phosphorylated at Y by the membrane bound c-Src. This phosphorylation (Y) is followed by phosphorylation of Akt A-loop (T308) and HM (S473) by PDK1 and mTORC2 respectively. Once the receptor is activated, a second signaling pathway is mediated by β-arrestins 1 and 2, involving the recruitment of GHS-R1a, c-Src and Akt into an β-arrestin-scaffolded complex.</div></div>
