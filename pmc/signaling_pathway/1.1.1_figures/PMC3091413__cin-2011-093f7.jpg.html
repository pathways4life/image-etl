The results are based on genes containing SNPs with the largest effect size (P &lt; 10âˆ’5). Nodes represent genes and vertices represent interactions. The color code denotes the biological process in which the genes are involved as defined in Figure 3. The color codes in the vertices indicate the experimental techniques or a combination thereof used to confirm the relationship between the genes as determined by the experiments reported in the literature. Candidate genes containing SNPs associated with risk for breast cancer are shown in red, genes involved in the Notch signaling pathway are shown in blue and novel genes are shown in black.</div></div>
