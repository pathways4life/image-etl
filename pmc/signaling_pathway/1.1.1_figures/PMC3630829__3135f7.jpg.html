In addition, the SH2 domain of SLP-76 is necessary for recruitment via ADAP to the plasma membrane through an unknown mechanism. The strength of downstream signals generated by the LAT family-dependent or ADAP-dependent SLP-76 pathway alone is sufficient for phosphorylation of AKT and ERK and for NK cell proliferation. However, both pathways are necessary for optimal IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity. Although depicted in the figure, note only LAT1, not LAT2, cooperatively binds PLC with SLP-76.</div></div>
