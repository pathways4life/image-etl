Upon stimulation by extracellular calcium, calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) activates PLC, which is responsible for the translocation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in mature osteoclasts, in an IP3-dependent manner. Upon stimulation by extracellular strontium, CaR also activates PLC inducing the DAG-PKCβII signaling pathway and then promoting translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an IP3-independent manner.
