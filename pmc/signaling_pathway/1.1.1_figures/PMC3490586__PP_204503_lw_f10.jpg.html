In eudicots, SL promotes expression of BRC1 and acts strictly through BRC1 to suppress axillary bud outgrowth. In rice, SL signaling acts partially through FC1 to inhibit outgrowth of axial buds. In maize, SL acts primarily on a downstream component of the Tb1 pathway to regulate bud outgrowth. The open arrows indicate a major effect on the suppression of bud outgrowth.</div></div>
