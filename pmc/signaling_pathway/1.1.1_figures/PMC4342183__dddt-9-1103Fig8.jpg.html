VEGF is an important signaling protein involved in both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. All members of the VEGF family stimulate cellular responses by binding to tyrosine kinase receptors (the VEGFRs) on the cell surface, causing them to dimerize and become activated through transphosphorylation. This triggers a signaling cascade that activates several signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, Erk1/2, Smad, and Notch, and results in endothelial cell proliferation and migration. A number of studies have shown that VEGF and its associated proteins are aberrant in EC.117â€“122 These proteins represent useful targets in the treatment of EC.<b>Abbreviations:</b> EC, endometrial cancer; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.</div></div>
