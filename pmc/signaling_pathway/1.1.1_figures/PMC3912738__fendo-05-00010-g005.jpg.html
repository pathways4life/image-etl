Shh binds to patched family receptors (PTCH) to releases smoothened (SMO) signal transducer from Patched-dependent suppression. Activated SMO, in turn, induces SKT36 serine/threonine kinase to stabilize GLI family members for nuclear translocation. Shh signaling activates GLI dependent transcription of target genes including N-myc, D-cyclins, BMI1, GLI1, Bcl-2, and IRS-1, all of which have been implicated in cell cycle progression, proliferation, and stemness. IRS-1, in turn, mediates IGF-IR/PI3K signaling activation, which inhibits GSK3Î²-mediated phosphorylation and consequent increased degradation of N-myc and D-cyclins. However, Shh may also activate IGF-IR/PI3K pathway via unknown intermediary molecules.</div></div>
