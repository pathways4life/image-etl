From: Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> by a mutant thyroid hormone ? receptor. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Activation of PI3K signaling by PV. The physical interaction of PV with p85α results in the activation of two PI3K downstream pathways: the AKT–ILK–MMP pathway and the AKT–mTOR–p70S6K pathway. The activation of the former leads to the degradation of the extracellular matrix involved in cell invasion and metastasis, and the activation of the latter results in increased cell proliferation and suppression of apoptosis. The bracket indicates that PV did not have an effect on the expression of PTEN, suggesting that PV-induced activation of PI3K is not mediated by the repression of PTEN.</div></div>
