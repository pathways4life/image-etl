The gene expression studies are used as an independent predictive method for the prognosis. In cancer genomics studies, tremendous effort has been devoted to pathway-based analysis. Pathway analysis is a promising tool to identify the mechanisms that underlie disease, the adaptive physiological compensatory responses and new avenues for investigation. Different pathways have different biological functions. Thus, studying each pathway separately is reasonable. Among the many pathways, only a few have been shown to have predictive power for the development of cancer. In this sense, KEGG could be a useful tool to identify genetic signatures [52].</div></div>
