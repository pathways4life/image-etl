From: Anti-MHC Class I Antibody Activation of Proliferation and Survival <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Murine Cardiac Allografts. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Demonstration of interrelationships between proteins involved in the MHC class I-signaling pathway in vivo. MDS analysis of protein phosphorylation data obtained by Western blot shows that S6K and Akt are closely linked and members of the mTOR pathway: mTOR, S6K, S6RP, are linked to Akt and related to each other. The great distance separating ERK from members of the mTOR pathway suggests multiple signaling inputs are required for ERK activation.</div></div>
