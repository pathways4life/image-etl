Model of MOPr <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> showing that distinct molecules contribute to the development and expression of opioid tolerance..

If this change occurs at point C in the model, then repeated co-administration of an opioid with a drug that blocks signaling at points A, B, or C will prevent the development of tolerance. Once tolerance has developed, blocking signaling at points A or B will have no effect on the expression of tolerance because signaling at point C is already altered. However, a drug that blocks the enhanced signaling from points C, D, or E will block the expression of tolerance.</div></div>
