From: Influenza virus and cell <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Host cell machinery gets activated during influenza infection and leads to trigger Signaling pathways. Influenza is know to produce early and late viral proteins post infections. NS1, NP, PB1, PB2 are early protein and synthesize in 0–5 h.p.i. HA, NA, M1, NEP, M2, PB1-F2 are late proteins and synthesize in 5–10 h.p.i. This process leads to the virus production in between 5–12 h.p.i. and followed apoptosis of the cells in 20 h.p.i. During this whole processes some of the pathways are know to induce: 1, PI3-Akt pathway; 2, NFkB/lkB pathway; 3, MAPK pathway (A, JNK pathway; B, p38 pathway; C, ERK1/2 patyhway; D, ERK5 pathway); 4, protein kinase C (PKC)/PKR signaling; 5, TLR/RIG-I signaling.Symbols used in the Figure: ⊣ inhibition; ⇢ unknown mechanism; → direct activation; ⇆ reversible process.</div></div>
