From: Role of B-RafV600E in differentiated thyroid cancer and preclinical validation of compounds against B-RafV600E. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">When the B-RafV600E oncogene is generated through a point mutation, activation of the MAP kinase pathway becomes constitutive, inducing cells to proliferate indefinitely and initiate tumor formation. B-RafV600E shows a dramatically increased basal kinase activity (increased phosphorylation, PO4âˆ’), ~480-folds higher than wild-type B-Raf activity. Response to B-RafV600E is independent of extra-cellular mitogens and Ras signaling, creating a deregulation of transcription mechanisms. The B-RafV600E-activated phospho-ERK1/2 pathway transforms human normal cells both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, B-RafV600E induces senescence in normal human foreskin fibroblasts by stimulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4a.</div></div>
