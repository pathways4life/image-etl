From: A New Bioinformatics Approach to Analyze Gene Expressions and <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways Reveals Unique Purine Gene Dysregulation Profiles that Distinguish between CD and UC. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Canonical pathway analysis reveals novel signaling pathways associated with CD73 / NT5E or ADORA3 mRNA gene dysregulation that distinguish between CD and UC. (A, B) NT5E pathway analysis reveals that NT5E gene dysregulation is associated with acute phase response signaling, cAMP-mediated signaling, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and G-protein coupled receptor signaling (i.e. bars above threshold line for significant association). A distinct profile is observed in UC (B). ADORA3 pathway analysis reveals that ADORA3 gene dysregulation is associated with acute phase response signaling, cAMP-mediated signaling, G-protein coupled receptor signaling, IGF-1 signaling and IL-10 signaling. A distinct profile is observed in UC (D). Bars – The significance calculated for each function/Canonical Pathway is a measurement of the likelihood that the function is associated with the dataset by random chance. On the y-axis of the diagram, the significance is expressed as the minus log (10-based) of the p-values calculated from Ingenuity pathway analysis and Fischer's exact test. Threshold set at 0.05 for p-value, in the chart it corresponds to −log (0.05)). Note: the higher the bar, the lower the p-value and hence the more significant for the enrichment of the group/pathway/network. Ratio - The ratio between the number of genes in our list and the total number of genes in the defined functional group or pathway or network; curve just links all the data points for the ratio.</div></div>
