(<b>A</b>) The members of the TNF-α pathway that were significantly regulated by PNF1 over at least one timepoint (spanning 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 h post-supplementation). These renderings are based on available literature on these pathways, as taken from the BioCarta Proteomic Pathway Project (http://www.biocarta.com/genes/index.asp) and supplemented by the IPKB. Shaded gene products represent PNF1-stimulated genes; gene products not shaded (white) were not significantly regulated by the drug but are required for signaling between PNF1-regulated genes. (<b>B</b>) Plots of the fold changes over time for the individual gene products in the TNF-α pathway that were significantly differentially expressed after PNF1 stimulation.</div></div>
