Density of the number of targets in miRNA-pathway associations (solid line). Although the number of targets in a significantly enriched (FDR &lt; 0.01) pathway is mainly between 10 and 20 (dotted line), significantly proximal (FDR &lt; 0.01) targeted pathways have three to seven targets (dashed line). Thus proximity and enrichment score identify two alternative forms of miRNA control.</div></div>
