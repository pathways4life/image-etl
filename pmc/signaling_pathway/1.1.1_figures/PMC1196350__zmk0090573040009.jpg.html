Calcimycin induces an increase of the intracellular calcium, which induces RAS-GRF2 translocation from cytosol to plasma membrane to activate RAS. RAS then activates RAF1, leading to activation of the downstream MEK1/2, which activates ERK1/2. Activation of this pathway triggers p53 up-regulation and activation, which through regulation of Bax, signals the mitochondrial death pathway as reflected by the release of cytochrome c followed by activation of caspase-3. In lens epithelial cells (LECs), stress-activated RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway mediates apoptosis, leading to elimination of cells with genome lesion. In contrast, in most other cells, the same pathway activated by stress promotes survival, allowing accumulation of cells with damaged DNA, which likely develops into cancer. This partially explains why the ocular lens lacks spontaneous tumor. αB-crystallin suppresses calcimycin-induced RAS-GRF2 translocation to block RAS activation and thus suppress the activation of ERK signaling pathway. Through repression of ERK1/2 activation, it prevents downstream apoptotic events including calcimycin-induced up-regulation of p53 and Bax, release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3. Up-arrow stands for the increase of intracellular calcium (Ca2+), or up-regulation of enzyme activity (RAS, RAF1, MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and capase-3), or up-regulation of protein (p53, Bax, and cytochrome c).</div></div>
