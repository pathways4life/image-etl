Mechanisms of inflammation-mediated alteration of insulin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>.  From: Emerging Role of Adipose Tissue Hypoxia in Obesity and Insulin Resistance. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Hypoxia and FFAs in obesity lead to activation of NF-kB pathway, which induces expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, et al) in adipose tissue. Through receptor-mediated signal transduction, these cytokines activates serine kinases including IKK, JNK, PKC and p70S6K to inhibit IRS-1 function. NF-kB inhibits PPARÎ³ function through nuclear corepressor and results in suppression of the gene transcription of CAP and IRS-2, which are signaling molecules in PI(3)K-independent and -dependent signaling pathways for insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation. Hypoxia also induces FFA level through lipolysis.</div></div>
