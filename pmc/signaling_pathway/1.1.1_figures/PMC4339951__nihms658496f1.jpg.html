A) When myofibers are injured, osteopontin and TGFβ signaling pathways are activated, leading to ECM accumulation and fibrosis of the muscle. B) TGFβ activates the SPP1 promoter through SMAD signaling. A SNP in the SPP1 promoter is associated with a more severe form of DMD. A SNP in TGFBR2 results in increased SPP1 expression. The “VTTT” allele of LTBP4 leads to increased TGFβ signaling and is associated with a more severe form of DMD. Treatment of myoblasts with TGFβ results in increased osteopontin expression. The mdx mouse deficient for SPP1/osteopontin has reduced TGFβ signaling and reduced fibrosis.</div></div>
