Cellular Model of essential components in MI progression..  From: MiRNA and TF co-regulatory network analysis for the pathology and recurrence of myocardial infarction. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The graph illustrates the proposed model of MI progression co-regulated by miR-16-5p, miR-26b-5p, miR-29a-3p and the TFs; JUN, YY1, EGR1, SP1, GATA2 and MYC. These regulators control components of the VEGF signaling pathways, PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, MAPK signaling pathway and TGFÎ² signaling pathway. Red rectangle represents miRNAs. Regulations by arrows in orange and green are predicted and verified regulations, respectively.</div></div>
