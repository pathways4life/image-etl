From: Ligand Bias at Metabotropic Glutamate 1a Receptors: Molecular Determinants That Distinguish ?-Arrestin-Mediated from G Protein-Mediated <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Biased signaling of mGlu1a receptors. Upon agonist (Ago) stimulation, mGlu1a receptors activate two independent signaling pathways. Agonists such as quisqualate and DHPG activate G protein-mediated signaling leading to the activation of phospholipase C, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and protein kinase C (PKC) and resulting in transient increases in ERK phosphorylation. This signaling is abolished with mutation of the Thr188 residue in the agonist binding pocket and can be disrupted by the PLC inhibitor U73122. In contrast, glutarate and succinate activate the β-arrestin-1 (βArr1)-dependent pathway, which involves receptor internalization, leads to sustained ERK phosphorylation, and is responsible for the cytoprotective actions of mGlu1a receptors. This signaling is abolished with mutation of Arg323 or Lys409 residues in the agonist binding pocket and can be disrupted through shRNA-mediated inhibition of β-arrestin-1 expression. Glutamate, aspartate, and cysteate are unbiased ligands that activate both pathways. Amino acid mutations that block one of the signaling pathways do not prevent the actions of agonists at the other pathway. MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase.</div></div>
