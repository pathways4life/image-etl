Proposed mechanism of Periostin-mediated accelerated epithelial healing through the mTOR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>..  From: Periostin Responds to Mechanical Stress and Tension by Activating the MTOR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">During wound healing, activation of the Periostin signaling circuitry is initiated by the extracellular accumulation of Periostin secreted by fibroblasts, and by intracellular periostin originated after mechanical stress. Following, activation of the mTOR pathway occurs. Notably, the mTORC1 is required for Periostin-driven accelerated epithelial migration, while activation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 is required for epithelial proliferation. </div></div>
