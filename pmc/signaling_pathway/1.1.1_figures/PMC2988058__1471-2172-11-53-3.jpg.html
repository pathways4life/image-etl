HOKs were incubated with inhibitors for PI3K (Wortmannin) at 25-400 nM (a-b) or for Akt (Akt inhibitor IV) at 0.5-2.5 uM (c-d) for 1 h and subsequently stimulated with thrombin (10 U/ml) or trypsin (10 nM) for 6 h. Cells were harvested and expression of the selected markers was assessed by QRT-PCR. Data from three separate donors set up in duplicates were normalized to GAPDH. Data are given as means of normalized samples to unstimulated control Â± SEM. (*p &lt; 0.05 compared to the same condition without inhibitors).</div></div>
