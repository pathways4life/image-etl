Agonist activation of either the P2Y1 or the P2Y12 receptor causes an increase in the rate of guanine nucleotide exchange on Gαq or Gαi, respectively, whereby GTP replaces GDP, creating the active species Gα-GTP. The signaling pathway is turned off by hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP by the G protein. GAPs, such as RGS proteins, or PLC-β in the case of Gαq, augment the rate of GTP hydrolysis. Hence, two important rate limiting steps exist in the signaling pathway: (1) the rate of guanine nucleotide exchange (regulated by the agonist-activated receptor acting as a GEF) and (2) the rate of GTP hydrolysis (regulated by GAPs).</div></div>
