From: CATERPILLER (NLR) Family Members as Positive and Negative Regulators of Inflammatory Responses. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Scheme depicting how Monarch-1 suppresses inflammatory signaling. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and tumor necrosis factor family receptors (TNFRs) play a critical in the inflammatory response. TLRs recruit the adaptor molecules, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and Tollip, which, in turn, recruit the kinase, IL-1 receptor–associated kinase (IRAK-1), to induce the activation of canonical nuclear factor (NF)–κB. IRAK-1 becomes hyperphosphorylated, facilitating its dissociation from the receptor complex to mediate additional signaling pathways. One of the genes induced by the canonical pathway is NF-κB2/p100, which functions in the noncanonical pathway. The noncanonical pathway is triggered after the activation of NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK). This results in processing of p100 to its active form, p52. This alternative pathway induces a distinct set of genes and also regulates the expression of genes induced by the canonical pathway. Monarch-1 does not affect initial activation of the canonical pathway. However, Monarch-1 suppresses the noncanonical pathway by associating with NIK and inducing its degradation via the proteasome. Monarch-1 also associates with IRAK-1 and suppresses the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated forms of the kinase; however, it is unclear whether or not this also involves proteasome degradation.</div></div>
