EPI precursor cells express and secrete Fgf4, whereas PrE precursor cells express Fgfr2. Binding of Fgf4 to Fgfr2 activates the FGF/MAPK signaling pathway, which is required for the induction of PrE-specific transcription factors, thus promoting PrE formation. When the signaling is not active, such as in Fgf4 mutants or by inhibiting the receptor Fgfr2, PrE is not formed and all ICM cells contribute to EPI. On the contrary, in the presence of excess Fgf4, all ICM cells contribute to PrE</div></div>
