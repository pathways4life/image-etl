In this model, proliferative cells in the mitotic zone (green) have active GLP-1/Notch signaling. This signaling inhibits the activity of GLD-1 by limiting its expression in the distal end (Hansen and Schedl 2006), which allows for specific mRNAs to be translated and produce proteins necessary for proliferation (blue). As part of one model, an unknown factor (X) may also inhibit GLD-1 activity in a manner independent of GLP-1/Notch signaling (see discussion). As cells move proximally, GLP-1/Notch signaling is reduced due to the distance from the LAG-2 ligand expressed in the DTC (yellow), and cells enter meiotic prophase (red). The proteasome also degrades a core component(s) or positive regulator of GLP-1/Notch signaling, reducing the level of signaling further. Reduced GLP-1/Notch signaling allows GLD-1 to bind target mRNAs, preventing further production of proliferation proteins. The proteasome could interact with the GLD-1 pathway by degrading a negative regulator of GLD-1 activity (factor X) and/or by degrading proliferation proteins that were translated while cells were still in mitosis, but persist as cells enter meiotic prophase. In either situation, proliferation protein levels are reduced, which allows cells to enter meiotic prophase (red). Dashed lines represent reduced activity.</div></div>
