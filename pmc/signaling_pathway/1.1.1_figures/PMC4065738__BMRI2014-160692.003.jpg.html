From: The Role of Ubiquitination and Sumoylation in Diabetic Nephropathy. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway by SUMO. Multiple signal transduction molecules of NF-κB pathway, such as IκBα, NEMO, RelA, and P100, can be modified by SUMO. After SUMO-1 conjugated to NEMO, the IKK would be activated, similarly, SUMOylation IκBα conjugated to the SUMO-1, and this would lead to the degradation of IκBα and activation of the NF-κB pathway. And the SUMOylation of RelA and P100 was in accord with NEMO.</div></div>
