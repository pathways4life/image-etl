Suppression of AKT activity leads to a de-repression of AKT substrates PRAS40, FOXO and GSK3β due to the reduction of AKT-mediated phosphorylation. (B) In cells where AKT signaling is aberrantly activated (by PTEN loss, PI3K activation, or RTK amplification), the negative impact of BRAFV600E is countered by a dominant input upstream of AKT. Consequently, activated AKT phosphorylates substrates PRAS40, FOXO and GSK3β and suppresses their activity.</div></div>
