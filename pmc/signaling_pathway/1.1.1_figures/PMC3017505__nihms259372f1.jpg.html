Active Gα releases Gβγ, which then binds to both the Ste20 protein kinase (PAK) and the Ste5 scaffold protein. Ste5 tugs Ste11 (MEKK), the first domino in the MAP kinase cascade, to the membrane, where it is phosphorylated and thereby activated by Ste20PAK. The new work by Slessareva et al. [2] provides evidence for the existence of a new branch of the pathway (surrounded by dotted frame) that modulates the efficiency of signaling through the classic branch. In the new branch, active Gα is proposed to move to the endosome, where it binds PI 3-kinase (Vps34) and to an associated protein kinase (Vps15) and stimulates the production of PI 3-phosphate at the endosome. The figure shows the PI 3-phosphate recruiting an unknown phospholipid-binding protein (represented by ?), perhaps Bem1, which reconnects to the classic pathway at an unknown point upstream of MAP kinase activation.</div></div>
