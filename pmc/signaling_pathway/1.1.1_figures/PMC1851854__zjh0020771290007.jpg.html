From: Repression of Repulsive Guidance Molecule C during Inflammation Is Independent of Hfe and Involves Tumor Necrosis Factor-?. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model showing the iron-sensing and inflammatory pathways for Rgmc and hepcidin regulation. Iron-sensing pathway: Hfe/β2m and Rgmc regulate basal hepcidin expression independently. Iron-sensing by Rgmc does not involve modulation of Rgmc mRNA expression levels, but Rgmc is necessary for the regulation of hepcidin levels through the iron sensing-pathway.22 Inflammatory pathway: mRNA Rgmc down-regulation by LPS involves signaling through Tlr4 and consequent production of TNF-α. Down-regulation of Rgmc suppresses hepcidin control through the iron-sensing pathway and allows hepcidin induction by IL-6.</div></div>
