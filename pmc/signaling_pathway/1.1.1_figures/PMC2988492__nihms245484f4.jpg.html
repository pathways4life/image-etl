From: Serine496 of ?2 Subunit of L-type Ca2+ Channel Participates in Molecular Crosstalk between Activation of (Na++K+)-ATPase and the Channel. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Potential elements of PKG-independent signaling mechanism underlying NKA-LTCC crosstalk. Binding of activator SSA412 to NKA not only enhances native catalytic activity of the enzyme, but also triggers signal to activate Src and Erk1/2. These signaling proteins would then relay the signals to phosphorylate both LTCC β2 Ser496 and α1 Ser1928. Black arrows indicate the direction of activation of NKA-induced signaling pathway. The dotted lines show undiscovered proteins that may participate in the activation of NKA-induced signal transduction pathway. Phosphorylation of α1 Ser1928 may lead to up-regulation of LTCC activity. Phosphorylation of β2 Ser496 may be linked to down-regulation of the channel.</div></div>
