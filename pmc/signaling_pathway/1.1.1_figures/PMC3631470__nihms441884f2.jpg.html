Cells were treated with TiO2 NPs to observe the activation of three types of MAPK signaling pathways, p38, ERK and JNK, as well as the Akt signaling pathway. The images shown here are phosphorylated signaling molecules at the time of maximum induction. The Western blots shown here are representative images of three independent experiments.</div></div>
