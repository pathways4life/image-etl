Mechanistically, α-casein functionally induced interferon-associated STAT1-signaling and reduced the “stemness” of mammary tumor cells. Thus, α-casein may mediate its tumor suppressor effects by conferring a more “differentiated” mammary cell phenotype. These findings define a previously unrecognized signal transduction pathway and identify α-casein as a signaling molecule.</div></div>
