Normally this pathway induces cell growth suppressive effects, however, during the process of tumorigenesis due to several factors TGF-β signaling pathway induces proliferation, invasiveness, angiogenesis, metastasis and immune suppression. In this figure, based on the findings from our group, radiation can potently induce TGF-β and this TGF-β can be activated to exert negative growth effects by inducing the expression of cdk inhibitors such as p21 and p16. It is also shown here that the inhibitory Smad7 can be induced by Smad4 that can in turn inhibit the TGF-β signaling.</div></div>
