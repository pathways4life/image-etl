The role of O-GlcNAc cycling is emphasized, but UDP-GlcNAc is also the precursor for glycolipids, O-linked GalNAc and N-linked Glycoproteins in the endomembrane system as indicated by other on each side of the UDP-HexNAcs (see text). The mammalian enzymes are listed with the C. elegans homologs in italics. The nutrient-derived precursors glucose, glutamine, acetyl-CoA, UTP are integrated by the pathway and UDP-GlcNAc levels reflect the nutrient status. O-GlcNAc cycling is the terminal step in the hexosamine signaling pathway.</div></div>
