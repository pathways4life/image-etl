Experiments were performed at least 10 times for each experiment, and similar results were obtained. (G), Model for the establishment of PCP during zebrafish convergence and extension by noncell-autonomous activity of STAT3 signaling. In gastrula organizer cells, STAT3 induces an as-yet-unidentified signaling molecule (X) that is able to noncell-autonomously activate Dishevelled-RhoA signaling in the PCP pathway in neighboring cells to establish the PCP. The converging neighboring cells may sense the extracellular gradient of signaling molecules through the receptor Frizzled (Fz), and translate this signal into the transmembrane protein Strabismus (Stbm), an intracellular modulator Dishevelled (Dsh), and its downstream effector RhoA. Alternatively, non-Frizzled receptors (Y) such as PTK7/CCK-4 may sense the gradient of signaling molecules, which are expressed in gastrula organizer by STAT3 signaling and noncell-autonomously activate PCP signaling in neighboring cells during zebrafish convergence and extension movements.</div></div>
