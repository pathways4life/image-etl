SW480 cells were treated for 12h with 4µM of henryin with 0.5% DMSO used as a control in the assay. GO annotation and pathway analysis were employed from the BioCarta and KEGG databases, respectively. The genes with fold alteration of at least &gt;2 (up-regulated) or &lt;0.5(down-regulated) were taken as differentially expressed genes. Data analysis and the statistics were generated only when the hits &gt; 5 in each signaling pathway. Representative pathways obtained after microarray data analysis are shown. (C) Henryin inhibits the Wnt reporter expression in a dose-dependent manner in wnt1 transfected HEK293T cells, and in colorectal cancer cells, SW480 and HCT116. Three hours after transfection of the Wnt1 and/or ST-Luc, DMSO or henryin with indicated dosage was added to the cells for additional 24h and luciferase activity was then measured. (D) Henryin (4µM) preferentially inhibits the Wnt signaling (ST-Luc) over the NF-κB signaling pathway (NF-κB-Luc) in HEK293T cells. Wnt signaling was stimulated by transfection of wnt1 and NF-κB signaling was stimulated with 25ng/mL TNFα. Each bar is the mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, relative to vehicle control. NS, not significant.</div></div>
