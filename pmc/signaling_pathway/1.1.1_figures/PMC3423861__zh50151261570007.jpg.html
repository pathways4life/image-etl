From: Angiotensin II regulates activation of Bim via Rb/E2F1 during apoptosis: involvement of interaction between AMPK?1/2 and Cdk4. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed models of Ang II-induced apoptosis signaling in PAEC. Schematic of the physiological AMPKβ1/2-Cdk4 complex for apoptotic signaling upon Ang II stimulation. Ang II binds to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) AT2 receptor to transduce downstream signaling pathway for cell growth/differentiation, inflammation, and apoptosis (44). In untreated cells, AMPKβ1/2 is associated with Cdk4. Upon treatment with Ang II treatment, Cdk4 is dissociated from AMPKβ1/2, coincidentally with AMPKβ1 phosphorylation. Cdk4-mediated hyperphosphorylation of Rb renders release of E2F1 from Rb. Free E2F1 binds to the promoter region of the proapoptotic Bim protein for transcriptional activation. At the same time, Ang II treatment suppresses antiapoptotic signaling by the Akt pathway by suppressing basal Akt phosphorylation. MOMP, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization.</div></div>
