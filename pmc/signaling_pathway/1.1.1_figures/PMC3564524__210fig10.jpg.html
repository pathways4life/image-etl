From: Apolipoprotein(a) stimulates nuclear translocation of ?-catenin: a novel pathogenic mechanism for lipoprotein(a). </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Novel signaling pathways involved in apo(a)-mediated effects on vascular endothelial cells. Apo(a), through its strong LBS in KIV10, binds to a putative receptor (possibly a complex of CD36 and TLR2), resulting in activation of a Src- and Rho/Rho kinase–dependent pathway to increased VE-cadherin/β-catenin complex dissociation, leading to an increase in vascular permeability in cultured EC. Apo(a) also induces a PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway, independent of the Rho/Rho kinase pathway, to increase β-catenin nuclear translocation, and hence COX-2 expression, and PGE2 secretion. Furthermore, apo(a) mediates loss of cell–cell contact and stimulates β-catenin translocation by disrupting the VE-cadherin/β-catenin complex through inhibition of PTEN.</div></div>
