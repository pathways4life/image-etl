Fractional dose response is shown with respect to upstream activator Ras2GTP. Curve ‘a’ represents the FLO11 expression in diploids, where the total concentration of Ste12 is 5–10 fold less than haploids and cross-activation of MAPK pathway by cAMP pathway is not observed. Curve ‘b’ shows the case when the cross-activation is included in diploids. Curve ‘c’ represents the case for haploids, which shows complete expression</div></div>
