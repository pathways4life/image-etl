Nodes corresponding to proteins identified in the example data are color-coded according to regulation so up-regulated proteins are colored in shades of red, down-regulated proteins are colored in shades of blue and not regulated proteins are gray. This analysis illustrate that after 30 min of EGF stimulation the proteins upstream in the pathway have returned to the control state or are down-regulated while downstream effector proteins remain up-regulated.</div></div>
