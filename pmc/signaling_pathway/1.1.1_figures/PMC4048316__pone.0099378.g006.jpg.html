Effect of ATF4 siRNA on SFO-induced p75NTR expression in HUVECs was detected by qPCR assay (A) and western blot assay (B). Data below gels were used to quantify the density of the bands. (C to F) Cells were preincubated with p75NTR siRNA for 48 h, then 50 µg/ml of SFO for 3 h for qPCR assay and 6 h for western blot or ELISA assay. Effect of p75NTR siRNA on SFO-induced ATF4 expression in HUVECs was detected by qPCR assay (C) and western blot assay (D). Effect of p75NTR siRNA on SFO-induced IL-8 expression and release in HUVECs was detected by qPCR assay (E) and ELISA (F). G.
