SCRT-induced membrane depolarization seems to be mediated by 5-HT3 and/or 5-HT4 receptor, coupled to G protein, resulting in the activation of PLC pathway, which subsequently increases the intracellular Ca2+ level from SR. The data also suggest that MAPKs are involved in the SCRT-induced membrane depolarizations.</div></div>
