The canonical Wnt signaling pathway (left 2) and planar cell polarity pathway (right) are shown. Wnts, represented by yellow circles represent a large family of signaling molecules. In general, Wnts 1, 3a, 8 and 8b induce the canonical Wnt signaling pathway while Wnts 5a and 11 favor the non-canonical pathway; however, significant cross talk between these pathways has been observed. There are a number of other Wnt signaling pathways that have not been described here as their role in skin appendages is yet to be established. More detailed views are presented elsewhere.87,88</div></div>
