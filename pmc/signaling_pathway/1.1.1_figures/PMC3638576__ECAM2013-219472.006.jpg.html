From:  Ganoderma tsugae Extract Inhibits Growth of HER2-Overexpressing Cancer Cells via Modulation of HER2/PI3K/Akt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A schematic model of the GTE-mediated antiproliferative effect on HER2-overexpressing cancer cells. Ligand stimulation induces the activation of the HER2 receptor, which in turn activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and then promotes cell growth and survival. After GTE treatment, the proliferation is inhibited because of an induction of cell cycle arrest. The GTE-mediated growth repression coincides with a reduction in the transcriptional activity of HER2 gene and an induction in the degradation of HER2 protein, leading to a downregulation of the HER2/PI3K/Akt pathway.</div></div>
