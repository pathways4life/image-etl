Stimulation/production relationships are depicted by green connectors; inhibitory relationships are seen as red connectors. The signaling network comprises the Wingless-related integration site (Wnt), Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), Phosphotase and tensin homolog/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PTEN/PI3K), Sonic Hedgehog Homolog (Hh), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α, Interferon (IFN)-γ, RIP Kinase, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), Janus Kinase (JAK), Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), and reactive oxygen species (ROSs), and Interleukin (IL) 6,10,13, and 15 signaling pathways.</div></div>
