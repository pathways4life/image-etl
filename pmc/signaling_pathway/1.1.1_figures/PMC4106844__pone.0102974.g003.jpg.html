Cells were then stimulated with 20 µM FnIII-1c for 1vh. Cells were lysed and the nuclear fraction isolated and analyzed by Western blot for the presence of NF-κB protein p65/rel A (A). Blots were quantified by densitometry and normalized to total lamin A/C. Values are mean ± S.D. of 3 separate experiments (B). Cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed by Western blot for p-p38 (C). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with an antibody to nuclear Lamin A/C or FAK, which served as loading control. Proposed signaling pathway (D).</div></div>
