From: Protein kinase C?: human oncogene, prognostic marker and therapeutic target. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PKCι resides in several major signaling pathways implicated in human cancer. Many components of these pathway are mutated, often by multiple mechanisms (ie. gene amplification and somatic mutation), in human tumors (indicated by yellow boxes). Arrows indicate flow through signaling pathways; touching boxes indicate directly binding of signaling components. Phosphorylation events are indicated by circled Ps.</div></div>
