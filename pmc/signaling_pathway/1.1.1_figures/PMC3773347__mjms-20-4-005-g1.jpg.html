From: Four Possible Itching Pathways Related to the TRPV1 Channel, Histamine, PAR-2 and Serotonin. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A schematic diagram showing the four putative itch signaling pathways. 1) TRPV1-expressing small sensory neurons that mediate itching via histamine or ET-1, as well as inflammatory pain. 2) TRPV1-negative (capsaicin-insensitive) pathway activated by histamine; this pathway likely transmits acute noxious heat as well. Nonhistaminergic pathway activated by 3) PAR-2 or 4) 5-HT, which terminate in the lateral part of lamina I as separate from the histaminergic pathways.</div></div>
