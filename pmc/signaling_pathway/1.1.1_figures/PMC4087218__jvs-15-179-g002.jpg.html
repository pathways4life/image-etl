(A) The phosphorylation levels of IRS-1 (Ser636, Ser639). (B) The levels of PI3-kinase p85-subunit α/γ (Tyr467/Tyr199) and PDK1 (Ser241) among the control, HF, and HFR groups were compared. Proteins extracted from each group (n = 12) were combined, and phosphorylation levels were analyzed using the antibody array.</div></div>
