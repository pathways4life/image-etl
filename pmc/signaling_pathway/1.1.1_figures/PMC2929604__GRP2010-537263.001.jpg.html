From: Toll-Like Receptors in Hepatic Ischemia/Reperfusion and Transplantation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Role of TLR4 in hepatic I/R injury.  Signaling through the pattern recognition receptor TLR4 mediates multiple inflammatory pathways following hepatic I/R.  The activation of TLR4 signaling is dependent, in part, on circulating DAMPs.  Downstream signaling events include the TRIF-dependent activation of IRF3, the production of Type I IFN, and upregulation of CXCL10.  Additionally, TLR4 activation of IRF1 promotes release of the DAMP, HMGB1.  Lastly, TLR4 activation is thought to suppress the cytoprotective HO-1 pathway.</div></div>
