From: Clinical Implications of Cancer Stem Cell Biology in Hepatocellular Carcinoma. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Wnt/β-catenin, AKT, TGF-β and IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways are deregulated in hepatic CSCs. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol and translocation into the nucleus, where β-catenin transcriptional activates the expression of its targets, such as cyclinD1, EpCAM, and miR-181. AKT is activated by two phosphorylation sites Thr308 and Ser473. Phosphorylation of Thr308 is promoted by PI3K and suppressed by PTEN. Activated AKT protect hepatic CSCs from apoptosis through the induction of BCL-2 and ABCG2 under the pressure of chemotherapy. Activated AKT could also interact with HIF-1α to induce VEGF and PDGF-BB expression for regulating the homeostasis and drug resistance of hepatic CSCs. Impaired TGF TGF-β signaling together with activation of IL-6/STAT3 pathway is important to regulate the differentiation and chemoresistance of EpCAM+ hepatic CSCs. Studies have shown that these pathways are interconnected, which may further promote stemness and carcinogenesis in HCC.</div></div>
