The pathway shows the mechanism that links the rotenone-mediated production of ROS by mitochondrial ETC Complex 1 to the activation of the p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK stress response pathways. The model suggests that the Trx-ASK1 complex plays a key role in regulation of the p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK stress response signaling pathways.</div></div>
