This model depicts the potential signaling pathways for targeting in HNSCC, including ligands, receptors and signaling intermediates of the tumor cells and the contributing vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Also shown are the molecular inhibitors currently in clinical investigation for the treatment of HNSCC. This model shows pathway convergence, pathway divergence and microenvironment signaling in order to demonstrate the potential of both single-targeting and multi-targeting drug approaches.</div></div>
