Factors influencing cell death include the stimulus, cell type, and the surrounding milieu of the cell and, therefore, its physiological state during receipt of the stimulus, which together dictate the pathway of cell death. In column A1, a stimulus (1) delivered to a cell type of interest in its baseline physiological state (α) dictates cell death via the primary pathway (P). Altering the magnitude of the stimulus (Δ1), e.g., multiplicity of infection, concentration, or concentration per unit time, can alter the path to cell death (A2, leading to pathway Q), as does the physiological state (β) of the cell during stimulation (A3, leading to pathway R) and the cell type being studied (A4, leading to pathway S). A single stimulus can simultaneously trigger multiple pathways (column B), and blockade of the primary pathway for a given cell type (column C versus column A1) can result in the use of alternate pathway(s) (column C). Finally, multiple stimuli (2,3, or 4), which may utilize a variety of upstream signaling cascades, may converge in the use of biologically conserved effector pathways and result in cell death (column D).</div></div>
