Both Ras and Src lie upstream of aPKC, as does PI3K, whereas aPKC lies upstream of NF-κB, directly interacting with IKK. Differentiation requires components of both the Src and Ras pathways. The differentiation pathway overlaps with components of the survival pathway through Src, aPKC, and PI3K. Survival signaling is Ras independent but dependent on PI3K, Src, aPKC, and NF-κB. Our findings support a model whereby aPKC occupies a critical node, capable of interacting with Ras-MAPK through modulation of MEK and JNK and upstream of NF-κB. NGFR, NGF receptor.</div></div>
