Left- subjecting cells to continuous ligand stimulation at different concentrations can reveal the presence of multiple signaling regimes: oscillatory and acute. Right- Exposing cells to periodic ligand stimulation can reveal the recovery properties of pathway signaling regimes not observable with continuous stimulation alone. Recovery properties are represented by a reduction of the amplitude of responses in later stimulation pulses in the acute regime, and skipped signals in the oscillatory regime.</div></div>
