From: Tumor Suppressor A20 Protects against Cardiac Hypertrophy and Fibrosis through Blocking TAK1-Dependent <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model of the process of A20. In the present study we demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of A20 are achieved by blocking 4 proposed signaling pathways. First, activated TAK1 results in activation of p38 and JNK signaling pathways, enhances hypertrophic markers expression, and subsequently leads to cardiac hypertrophy. Second, TAK1 is shown to promote the Smad signaling, increase expression of fibrotic markers, and result in collagen synthesis and fibrosis. Third, activation of TAK1 leads to signaling through the IKKβ/IκBα/NF-κB pathway, promoting proinflammatory cytokine expression and leading to inflammation. Fourth, hypertrophic stimuli also activate apoptotic signaling, ultimately leading to apoptosis. A20 blocks these proposed TAK1-dependent signaling pathways and apoptotic signaling and then protects against cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis, finally preventing the progression of cardiac remodeling and heart failure.</div></div>
