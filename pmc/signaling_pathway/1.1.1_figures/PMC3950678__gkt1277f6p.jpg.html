From: Causal inference of gene regulation with subnetwork assembly from genetical genomics data. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The causal gene network inferred from top discriminative modules at a significance level of 0.005. The major parts of the causal network that overlap with the KEGG maps are indicated. The network with green nodes involves metabolic pathways. The network with pink nodes provides a partial interface of the FAK signaling pathway, which communicates with the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and the MAPK signaling pathway. The network with yellow nodes mostly connected by dotted lines partially overlaps with the PPAR singling pathway, and the network is centered on RXRB. This is the first study to suggest that the RXRB-causal network is involved in lymph node metastasis.</div></div>
