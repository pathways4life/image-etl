Representative immunoblot images showing the expression levels of pEGFR, pAkt and pSTAT3 and their phosphorylated counterparts are shown. The cells were treated with NCX-4016 (100 Î¼M) for 12 or 24 h. The results show inhibition of EGFR and STAT3 activation, but no effect on MAPK pathway, in the CR cells treated with NCX-4016.</div></div>
