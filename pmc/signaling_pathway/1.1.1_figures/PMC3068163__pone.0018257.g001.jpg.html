The two major <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways implicated in melanoma are the MAPK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> (red) and the AKT/PI3K (green) <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> which regulate cell growth, proliferation and cell death..  From: A Melanoma Molecular Disease Model. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">There is a lot of cross-talk between these pathways and their downstream effectors, which we have classified into 8 pathways for simplicity to account for differences in treatment modalities (e.g. signaling through NRAS could affect both MAPK and AKT/PI3K pathways). The additional 6 pathways are: c-KIT (pink), CDK (blue), GNAQ/GNA11 (brown), MITF (orange), NRAS (yellow), and P53/BCL (purple). The complex relationship among BRAF, ARF/INK4A (via dashed line), p16, and p14ARF connotes an alternative splicing relationship.</div></div>
