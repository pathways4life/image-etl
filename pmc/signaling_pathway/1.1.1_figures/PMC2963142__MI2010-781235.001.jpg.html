Depicted are key TLR molecules, their signaling adaptors and downstream mediators that are essential for TLR signaling and function. The specific molecules in this network that are presently being interrogated as potential therapeutic targets include TLR7/9, MyD88 and IRAK1/4, as discussed in the text.</div></div>
