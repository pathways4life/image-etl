Modulation of plant development and acclimation to salinity are interconnected responses influenced by miR393 regulation node..  From: MiR393 Regulation of Auxin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> and Redox-Related Components during Acclimation to Salinity in Arabidopsis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">These two processes are strongly regulated by reciprocal interaction between ROS and auxin signaling pathway. NaCl-mediated stress would conduct to miR393 induction that targets TIR1-AFB2 auxin receptors leading to stabilization of Aux/IAA repressors and down- regulation of auxin signaling pathway. In turn, auxin modulation influences on ROS-associated metabolism. Salt exposition leading to SIMR would be under negative regulation of the auxin signaling pathway. Depending on time and intensity of salt stress, early ROS-auxin crosstalk may exert impact on SIMR and tolerance to salinity. Others hormones and/or miRNAs may also regulate auxin-dependent pathway and physiological responses during acclimation to salinity.</div></div>
