(A) Current model of canonical Wnt-signal transduction. See text for details. (B) Several models could explain the observation that Frat is not critically required for canonical Wnt signaling in mammals. (Left) Frat might be induced under specific conditions or it might feed into the canonical Wnt pathway from a parallel route independent from upstream Wnt signals. (Right) Alternatively, Frat might be involved in any of the numerous other GSK3-dependent cellular activities, such as the NFÎºB and NFAT signaling pathways.</div></div>
