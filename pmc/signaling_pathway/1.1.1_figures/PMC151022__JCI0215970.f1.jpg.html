TGF-βs bind and activate the TGF-β receptor complex, which transmits signal predominantly via activation and nuclear translocation of Smad proteins. However, several Smad-independent signaling pathways are also activated by this receptor complex, and the outcome of Smad signaling can be modified by interaction with other signaling pathways (1).</div></div>
