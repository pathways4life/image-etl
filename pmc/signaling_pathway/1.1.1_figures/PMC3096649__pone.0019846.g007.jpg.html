Simplified model for IGF1R <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in ES..

In the case of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, IGF1R is recruited to CCPs through interaction of its cytoplasmic tails with the protein adaptor AP2, which in turn recruits clathrin to the plasma membrane and promotes its assembly into a lattice network. Through protein-protein interaction, clathrin and AP2 also bind several proteins of the endocytic machinery, such as dynamin, which regulates the fission of the CCPs with the consequent formation of CCVs, and GRB2, which recruits and binds the SOS protein and the IGF1R-phosphorylated protein Shc, activating the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and p38MAPK signaling pathways. To a lesser extent, it also activates the IRS1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In the case of caveolin-dependent endocytosis, IGF1R is recruited to caveolae, promoting caveolin phosphorylation and the subsequent recruitment of dynamin, which promotes caveolar budding and the formation of cavicles. Cav-1 phosphorylation phosphorylates IRS-1, enhancing the activation of thePI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The thickness of the arrows indicates the prevalence of signaling pathway activation. CPMZ treatment inhibits the formation of CCP by inhibiting clathrin-heavy-chain conformations and MCB inhibits the formation of cavicles by depleting cholesterol, disrupting the caveolae.</div></div>
