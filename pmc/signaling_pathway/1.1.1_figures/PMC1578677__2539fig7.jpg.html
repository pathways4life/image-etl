Ptc monomers can multimerize to form stable trimers that repress the Hh signaling pathway, unless bound by Hh. Ptc monomers with a mutant CTD can form stable trimers that consist entirely of the mutant protein or include wild-type Ptc. Trimers containing CTD mutations can bind Hh, are stable, but are incapable of inactivating the Hh signaling pathway.</div></div>
