From: The therapeutic target of estrogen receptor-alpha36 in estrogen-dependent tumors. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Interactions between ER-α36 and EGFR in mitogenic signaling.</b> After treatment with estrogen, ER-α36 is dissociated from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and is associated with Src and Shc. Furthermore, E2 induces auto-phosphorylation of Src and Src-dependent phosphorylation of EGFR. EGFR activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5(STAT5), which leads to transcription of target genes such as Cyclin D1. On the other hand, ER-α36 and EGFR complex mediated non-genomic signaling like MAPK/ERK pathway is also involved in the signaling pathway contributing to cell proliferation.</div></div>
