Glutamate and Dopamine Receptor <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways..  From: Gene Expression Analysis in the Thalamus and Cerebrum of Horses Experimentally Infected with West Nile Virus. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) The diagrams represents signaling in the synaptic cleft (square = pre-synaptic neuron, oval = post-synaptic neuron, circle = glial cell). Green represents downregulation of pertinent receptors, red represents upregulation of pertinent receptors. WNV induces downregulation of glutamate receptors on the post-synaptic cleft as well as glutamate uptake receptors on glial cells. (B) Dopamine receptor signaling pathway. The graphic shown is for the exposure analysis, but was similar in all analyses. Green represents down-regulation of transcripts, red represents upregulation. Dopamine receptors (DRD5) and downstream signaling pathways as well as enzymes that create dopamine (TH) were downregulated, while MAO (enzyme that degrades dopamine) was upregulated. This network was generated through the use of IPA (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com).</div></div>
