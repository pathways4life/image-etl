In mouse PTs, low concentrations of Ang II induce transport stimulation via either PKC activation or decrease in intracellular cAMP resulting in ERK activation, while high concentrations of Ang II induce transport inhibition via NO/cGMP/cGKII pathway. In human PTs, by contrast, Ang II induces dose-dependent transport stimulation via NO/cGMP/ERK pathway.</div></div>
