Cytokine <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in T cell development and function.  From: Cytokine <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> modules in inflammatory responses. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Stat5 signaling from cytokines that use γc is essential for T cell development. Mice or humans lacking key components of this pathway (γc, Jak3, Stat5) fail to develop T cells. (B) Stat5 signaling controls the development of FoxP3-positive T regs. (C) Stat3 is crucial to the development and function of Th17 cells. IL-23 and IL-6 enforce Th17 development via the direct or indirect induction of Rorc and Rora expression. Stat3 also regulates the expression of IL-17-encoding genes and Il21, which acts in an autocrine/paracrine way to regulate Th17 cells. Socs3 is an important inhibitor of cytokines that use gp130 (IL-23R and IL-6R) while Socs1 is anticipated to inhibit any cytokines that use γc (IL-7, IL-21 as shown).</div></div>
