From: Virus reactivation: a panoramic view in human infections. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Alternative signaling pathways that involve Ras/Raf/NF-κB as key players in reactivation of different viruses are depicted. The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway of signaling interacts with other signal transduction pathways, leading to the activation of a variety of transcription factors that are critical for the transcription of specific cellular genes and in inducing viral reactivation. Signaling molecules that are boxed in blue are critical upstream components in the divergent MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. These molecules can be activated by one or more of the ligands listed above.</div></div>
