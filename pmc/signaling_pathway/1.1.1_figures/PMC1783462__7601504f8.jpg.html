In response to CD95 activation, DISC-activated caspase-8 triggers a feedforward loop triggering FLASH mobilization from nuclear bodies and its Crm1-dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation. Cytoplasmic FLASH accumulates at the mitochondria, where it interacts with mitochondria-associated caspase-8, thereby regulating its proteolytic activation. CD95-induced FLASH translocation is blocked by FADD-DN expression, by caspase-8 inhibition through zIETD-fmk and by treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB). E1B19K inhibits CD95-induced caspase-8 activation through trapping FLASH and caspase-8 in a ternary complex at the mitochondria.</div></div>
