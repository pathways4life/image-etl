This pathway includes genes for                                 both secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines and the intracellular                                 response through IL-17R. Red genes represent significant increases                                 in mRNA levels and blue genes represent significant decreases in                                 mRNA levels in thymus tissue following LPS treatment. Mean fold                                 changes are given. Green arrows indicate positive influence. Arrows                                 may represent multiple steps. Plasma membrane is shown in gray.                                 Nuclear membrane is shown as dotted line. A detailed version of the                                 original Metacore pathway is in Figure                                     S4.
