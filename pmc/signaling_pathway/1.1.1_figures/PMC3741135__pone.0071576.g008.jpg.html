A. Sirt1 interacts with PI3K which is an upstream gene in PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Endogenous PI3K in fat cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti–PI3K antibody, and coprecipitation of Sirt1 was detected by Western blot assay. B. Sirt1 interacts with GSK3β which is a downstream gene in PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Endogenous GSK3β in fat cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti–GSK3β antibody, and coprecipitation of Sirt1 was detected by Western blot assay.</div></div>
