Scale bar represents 1 (RCM) or 0.1 µM (EM). <b>B</b>) IP/WB studies show that after stimulation with ligand (3rd, 5th and 7th lane), IGF1R co-precipitates with both clathrin (1st row 5th lane; 2nd row 3rd lane) and with Cav1, although to a lesser extent (1st row 7th lane, 3rd row 3rd lane). TE: total extract. <b>C</b>) WB detection of the IGF1R signaling pathway after CAV1 or D) clathrin interference/inhibition. Both approaches inhibited the IGF1R signaling pathway, inhibiting both AKT and MAPK42/44 phosphorylation. Data presented is representative of 3–5 independent experiments for the RCM/EM studies and 3–6 independent experiments for the IP/WB studies.</div></div>
