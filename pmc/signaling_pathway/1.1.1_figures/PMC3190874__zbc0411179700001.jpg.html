Proximal FcϵRI signaling is mediated through Src family kinases and Syk (yellow). Adaptor proteins include LAT, NTAL/LAB/LAT2, Grb2, Gads, and SLP76 (aqua). Lipid signaling pathways are mediated by PI3K, SphK, PLD, and PLCγ (purple). Calcium signaling proceeds through a two-step process, consisting of the initial release of intracellular ER calcium stores, followed by extracellular calcium influx (green). Additional signaling molecules and pathways include Btk, which links PI3K activation to PLCγ activation (brown); Ras/MAPK pathways (orange); the PDK1/Akt/mTOR pathway (gray); PKCs (white); and NF-κB (pink). PA, phosphatidic acid; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor.</div></div>
