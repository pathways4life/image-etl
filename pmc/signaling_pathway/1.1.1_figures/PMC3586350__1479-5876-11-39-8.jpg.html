From: Adipose stromal cells primed with hypoxia and inflammation enhance cardiomyocyte proliferation rate in vitro through STAT3 and Erk1/2. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Schematic representation of proposed Adipose Stromal Cell-derived IL-6 signaling pathway.</b> The ADSC-secreted cytokine IL-6 and growth factors, which enhance the proliferation of cardiomyocytes through canonical signaling i.e. STAT3 activation and through non-canonical signaling i.e. Erk1/2 activation. The balance between STAT3 and Erk1/2 signaling is governed by STAT3, which can suppress Erk1/2 activation, through an unknown intermediate. In the absence of STAT3 signaling, IL-6-RAS-activated Erk1/2 can compensate for the potential loss of stimulatory effect on the proliferation on cardiomyocytes.</div></div>
