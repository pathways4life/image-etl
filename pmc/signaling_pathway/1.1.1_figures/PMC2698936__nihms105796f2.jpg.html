From: Integrins in Lens Development and Disease. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The great versatility of integrin receptors relies on their ability to form signaling complexes with many distinct signaling effectors. Possibly most important among these is the coordinate signaling between integrins and growth factor receptors. These signaling complexes are identified by co-immunoprecipitation of their component molecules. Modeled in this diagram is the α6 integrin signaling pathway activated as lens cells initiate their differentiation in the equatorial zone. This pathway involves transactivation of IGF-1R and ERK by α6 integrin. The activation of the IGF-1R leads to an ERK-dependent induction of Bcl-2 and IAP3.</div></div>
