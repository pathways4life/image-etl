Effect of SD118-xanthocillin X (<b>1</b>) on the MEK/ERK/mTOR pathway. HepG2 cells were treated with 24.3 µM SD118-xanthocillin X (<b>1</b>), harvested and subjected to western blot analysis, which shows the time-dependent reduction of p-ERK1/2, p-mTOR and Bcl2. Protein contents were normalized with β-actin.</div></div>
