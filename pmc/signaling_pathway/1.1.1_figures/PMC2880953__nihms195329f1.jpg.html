From: How degrading: Cyp26s in hindbrain development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Diagram of the RA pathway. An RA-producing cell (left) shows the biosynthetic pathway for RA and a responding cell (right) shows signaling and catabolism, although RA also likely acts in the cells that produce it. Retinyl esters and beta-carotene are important stores of RA precursor. Green dashed arrows point to components of the pathway induced by RA signaling. The red line denotes repression of aldh1as by RA. Once made, RA (yellow circles) enters cells and binds Crabps (blue ovals), which transport it either to RARs (blue and green ovals) in the nucleus (orange) for signaling or to Cyp26s (red hexagon) for degradation. ROH, retinol; RAL, retinal; adhs, alcohol dehydrogenases; aldh1as, aldehyde dehyrogenase 1as.</div></div>
