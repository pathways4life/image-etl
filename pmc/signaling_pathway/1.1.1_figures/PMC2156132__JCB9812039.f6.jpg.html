The schematic highlights the molecular events that were examined here to uncover the mechanism of TIMP-1–mediated inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation. The primary event in the pathway between TAg-induced IGF-II reactivation and hepatocyte proliferation affected by TIMP-1 overexpression was an increase in IGFBP-3 levels, due to the inhibition of MMP-mediated proteolysis of IGFBP-3 by TIMP-1. The direct result of increased IGFBP-3 levels was decreased dissociable IGF-II levels concomitant with decreased signaling through the IGF-IR and decreased hepatocyte proliferation.</div></div>
