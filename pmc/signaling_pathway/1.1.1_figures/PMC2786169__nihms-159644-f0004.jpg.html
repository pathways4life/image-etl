The arrows represent the directions of the causal relationships among genes. BCR are ABL are linked to the cytoplasm as a part of a large signaling complex with a variety of cellular substrates, related to the development of leukemia. The drug Gleevec is a selective BCR-ABL inhibitor in this pathway.</div></div>
