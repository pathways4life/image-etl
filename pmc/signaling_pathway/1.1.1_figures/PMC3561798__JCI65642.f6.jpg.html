Model of the molecular mechanism of coal tar therapy in AD..  From: Coal tar induces AHR-dependent skin barrier repair in atopic dermatitis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 activate the STAT6 signaling cascade, leading to downregulated expression of epidermal differentiation proteins, induction of the eosinophilic chemoattractant CCL26, and histopathological features such as spongiosis and apoptosis. Under normal conditions, PTPN1 dephosphorylates STAT6, resulting in a regulatory feedback loop. However, oxidative stress caused by Th2 cytokines inactivates PTPN1, leading to sustained STAT6 signaling. Coal tarâ€“mediated activation of the AHR signaling pathway leads to enhanced epidermal differentiation and possible improvement of epidermal barrier function, thereby attenuating allergen exposure and reducing inflammatory cues. Importantly, coal tar activates the AHR/NRF2 signaling pathway, enabling detoxification of reactive oxygen species. This may prevent the oxidative inactivation of PTPN1 and lead to decreased STAT6 signaling, normalization of skin barrier protein expression, and downregulation of CCL26 expression.</div></div>
