Nwk binds Dap160, dynamin and Thickveins to negatively regulate the BMP signaling pathway. Because Nwk specifically localizes to Rab11-positive endocytic compartments, we hypothesize that Nwk regulates receptor recycling through an RE-dependent pathway. Shunting Thickveins away from the more rapid RE-independent recycling route would have the effect of reducing plasma membrane receptor concentrations and, thus, neuronal responsiveness to the retrograde BMP signal.
