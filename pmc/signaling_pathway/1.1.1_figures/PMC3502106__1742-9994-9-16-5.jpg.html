Wnt/β-catenin signaling has to be preserved in order to induce or maintain FGFR expression, FGF-9 responsiveness, and continuance of FGF-Wnt/β-catenin feed-forward signaling. Loss of mesenchymal FGF-Wnt/β-catenin signaling increases Noggin expression in both the subepithelial and submesothelial mesenchyme. Lack of either pathway decreases mesenchymal proliferation. The change in the density of the shading of the epithelium shows the proximal-distal extent of the lung bud. Details can be acquired from Yin et al. [33], Rajagopal et al. [118], Yi et al.
