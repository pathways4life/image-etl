(A)</b> In the absence of Wnt ligand stimulation, β-cat is located within the “destruction complex”, phosphorylated by GSK-3 and CK-1α at Ser33 and adjacent serine positions, which leads to proteasome-mediated degradation process. <b>(B)</b> Following Wnt ligand stimulation, the destruction complex disassembles, resulting in free β-cat accumulation. It then enters the nucleus and forms the bipartite transcription factor β-cat/TCF, which leads to the stimulation of Wnt target gene expression. Lithium is an inhibitor of GSK-3, while cAMP signaling and insulin are able to stimulate β-cat Ser675 phosphorylation. Thus, in certain cell lineages, β-cat/TCF can also mediate the effect of lithium, cAMP, and insulin on Wnt target gene expression.</div></div>
