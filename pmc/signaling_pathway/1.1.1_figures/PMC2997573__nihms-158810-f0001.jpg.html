From: PELP1: A novel therapeutic target for hormonal cancers. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic representation of the current understanding of PELP1 signaling pathway. PELP1 appears to function as a scaffolding protein that facilitates formation of various signaling complexes and its expression is deregulated in hormonal cancers. PELP1 regulates multiple signaling pathways including ER-genomic signaling by facilitating epigenetic changes, ER-nongenomic signaling by activating Src-MAPK pathway, local estrogen synthesis via ERRÎ± - aromatase signaling and cell cycle progression via pRb/E2F pathway. PELP1 deregulation in hormonal tumors is likely to contribute to the development of tumorigenesis, metastasis and hormonal independence by activating multiple signaling pathways and by facilitating ER signaling cross talk.
