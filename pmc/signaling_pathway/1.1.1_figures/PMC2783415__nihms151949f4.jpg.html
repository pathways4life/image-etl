From: Interplay of CCR2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and local shear force determines vein graft neointimal hyperplasia in vivo. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Flow regulated neointimal hyperplasia in CCR2 -/- and wild type vein grafts. While reduction in flow accelerated neointimal hyperplasia in wild type vein grafts (P=0.01), this augmentation was abolished when CCR2 was absent. Absence of the CCR2 receptor had an influence only under low flow conditions, where significant attenuation in neointimal hyperplasia was observed with loss of this signaling pathway (P=0.04).</div></div>
