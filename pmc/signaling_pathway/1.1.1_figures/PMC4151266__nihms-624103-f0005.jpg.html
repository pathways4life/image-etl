Pathways activated in the three stage transitions containing central nodes were identified using IPA. (A) Activation of the FLT3 signaling pathway in ESER cells compared with that in HESCs. (B) Activation of cyclins and cell cycle regulation pathway in FLER cells compared with that in ESER cells. (C) Activation of ILK signaling pathway in PBER cells compared with that in FLER cells. Red and green represent up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. The extent of regulation is based on the color grade. Symbols with gradient colors indicate a gene family whose members change in different degree.</div></div>
