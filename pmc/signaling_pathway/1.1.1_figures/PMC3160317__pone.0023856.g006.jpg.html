Changes in expression of genes in the IFN and JAK-STAT <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways under HCV infection and/or IFN administration..  From: Hepatitis C Virus Infection Suppresses the Interferon Response in the Liver of the Human Hepatocyte Chimeric Mouse. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A) An overview of the IFN signaling pathway consisting of 26 representative genes is shown. Genes illustrated as gray shapes were not included in this study. B) Relative expression levels of genes with/without HCV infection and/or IFN administration were plotted (closed dots: with HCV infection; open dots: without HCV infection) using microarray data. The slopes of the dashed and solid lines represent IFN responsiveness with and without HCV infection, respectively. In 21 of the 22 examined genes in the IFN signaling pathway, signal intensities increased and IFN responsiveness was repressed following HCV infection. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. C) An overview of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway consisting of 22 representative gene products is shown. Genes illustrated as gray shapes were not included in this study. D) Relative expression levels of genes with/without HCV infection and/or IFN administration were plotted using microarray data (closed dots: with HCV infection; open dots: without HCV infection). Signal intensities increased following HCV infection in 16 of 22 genes in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and IFN response was suppressed in 9 genes. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.</div></div>
