Schematic showing the RhoA signaling pathway that is responsible for promoting MV formation in human cancer cells. The pathway culminates with the phosphorylation of cofilin, which inhibits its actin-severing activity. This results in increased actin polymerization and the generation of MVs. The ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, and LIMK siRNAs (for knocking-down LIMK expression) are particularly useful reagents for blocking RhoA-induced MV formation in cancer cells.</div></div>
