From: Protective Effect of Resveratrol against IL-1?-Induced Inflammatory Response on Human Osteoarthritic Chondrocytes Partly via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-?B <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>: An "in Vitro Study". </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic describing the proposed anti-inflammatory response resulting from resveratrol treatment and its effects on TLR4 following stimulation of chondrocytes with IL-1β. IL-1β-upregulated TLR4 expression results in the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway causing translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNFα. Resveratrol-mediated directly inhibition of TLR4 expression could block the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway (a1, dashed line), or resveratrol could affect TLR4 pathway processes in the nucleus through unknown regulatory mechanisms that regulate the gene expression (a2, dashed line); Direct inhibition of NF-κB by resveratrol, as described by Csaki [25] and Shakibaei [26] is shown in (b, solid line); Mechanisms involved in NF-κB suppression by resveratrol-activated SIRT1, as described by Lei [31] are shown in (c, solid line).</div></div>
