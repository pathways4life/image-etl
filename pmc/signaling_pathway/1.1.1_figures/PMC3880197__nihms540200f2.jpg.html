ROS-induced cellular <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>.  From: Reactive oxygen species in cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Reactive oxygen species in cells can be generated by growth factor signaling through activation of the NADPH oxidase NOX1 or through the mitochondria. These ROS then can induce cellular signaling cascades by reversible oxidation of phosphatases such as PTEN or PTP in their active site cysteins or by direct oxidation of kinases such as Src. This leads to the activation of several signaling cascades such as a Src/PKD1-dependent NF-ÎºB activation mechanism, the MAPK (Erk1/2, p38 and JNK) signaling cascades, as well as the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Other mechanisms, by which ROS induce cellular signaling is through activation of redox-regulated transcription factors such as AP-1 or FOXO.</div></div>
