This schematic summarizes many of the signaling pathways involved in hair follicle morphogenesis and hair follicle regeneration. Wnt/β-catenin signaling acts early in hair follicle specification and quiescent bulge stem cell (SC) activation. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway acts in the second step to promote embryonic and adult hair germ proliferation. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Notch, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways act further downstream to allow the normal differentiation of matrix cells into the hair shaft (HS) and its inner root sheath (IRS) envelope.</div></div>
