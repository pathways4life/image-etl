This model is a diagram of the alternative hypothesis that is more consistent with the quantitative mRNA data for Eda/Edar signaling than the hypothesis that NFÎºB1 serves as the main signaling pathway mediating Eda/Edar signaling. Black arrows represent processes (chemical reactions, transport, or binding). Rectangles represent states. A state is a molecule or complex in a physiologic place. The states are color coded as follows: Yellow is the unknown transcription factor TFx and its upstream activation signaling pathway; purple are the mRNA's; green are the promoters that are upregulated by TFx; red are the promoters that are downregulated by TFx. Places are represented by the background ivory or mauve bands of color and are labeled at the bottom of the diagram. Green and red dashed lines represent, respectively, positive or negative regulation of process by states. Processes with only starts or ends cross the boundary of the modeled system. This diagram was produced by ProcessDB software .</div></div>
