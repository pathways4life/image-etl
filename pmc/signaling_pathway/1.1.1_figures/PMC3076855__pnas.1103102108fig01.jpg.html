Binding of a Wnt ligand to membrane receptor/coreceptor triggers an intracellular signaling cascade leading to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. β-catenin in the nucleus binds to T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) and a number of cofactors to regulate gene expression. Red and green arrows indicate events that negatively and positively, respectively, affect signaling output. Examples of recently discovered small molecule inhibitors are shown, with their sites of action detailed in the table below the diagram.</div></div>
