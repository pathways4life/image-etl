(a) A constitutively activated form of TCF3, ΔN-XTCF3-VP16, rescues the effect of Gq signaling on TCF/LEF-1-mediated transcriptional activity in SW480 cells. SW480 cells were transfected with empty plasmid as a control or indicated expression plasmids. Relative TCF/LEF-1 transcriptional activity was assayed as described. (b) ΔN-XTCF3-VP16 rescues the effect of Gq signaling on cyclin D1 expression in SW480 cells. SW480 cells stably expressing M3R alone or together with ΔN-XTCF3-VP16 were treated without or with carbachol (1 mM) for 12 h. Total lysates were prepared and resolved by SDS/PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with antibody against cyclin D1. The untreated M3R-expressing cells were used as control and β-actin was the loading control. WB, Western blot. (c) ΔN-XTCF3-VP16 rescues the effect of Gq signaling on SW480 cell proliferation. A total of 2.5 × 103 cells stably expressing M3R alone or together with ΔN-XTCF3-VP16 were plated on 96-well plates. Cells were treated with carbachol (1 mM) for 12 h as indicated. Cell proliferation was assessed colorimeterically. The untreated M3R-expressing cells were used as control. Data shown are mean ± SD.</div></div>
