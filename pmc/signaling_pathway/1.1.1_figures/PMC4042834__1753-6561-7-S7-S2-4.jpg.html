The "MAPK signaling pathway" (hsa04010) is shown. Two functionally coherent subsets are highlighted. The genes summarized by GO:0023014 (Signal transduction by phosphorylation) are in green; the genes summarized by GO:0006915 (Apoptotic process) are in blue. Genes involved in both biological processes are in yellow.</div></div>
