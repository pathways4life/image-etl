This diagram shows an outline of the molecular pathway required for neuronal migration. Extracellular reelin binds to the membrane-bound receptors APOER2 and VLDLR, which stimulate the intracellular signaling molecule DAB1. Phosphorylated DAB1 interacts with LIS1. CDK5, thought to act via a parallel but intersecting pathway, is activated by P35 and phosphorylates the microtubule stabilizer DCX and NDEL1. NDEL1 complexes with LIS1 and dynein, which act to sustain microtubule bundles and facilitate nuclear migration</div></div>
