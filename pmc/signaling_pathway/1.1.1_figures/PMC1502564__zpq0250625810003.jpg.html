(A) Model diagram depicting the effects of pre-TCR signaling on E2A function. Signals from the pre-TCR complex abrogate the inhibitory effect of E2A proteins on the proliferation and differentiation of DN3 thymocytes to the DP stage. However, pre-TCR signaling also induces a function of E2A proteins in the down-regulation of CD25 expression. The asterisk indicates novel E-protein activities in response to pre-TCR signaling. Genes regulated by E47 in E2A-deficient lymphomas and during Î² selection are indicated. (B) Model diagram showing a regulatory network involving cytokine receptor-mediated signaling, E47, and SOCS activities in a common pathway. (C) Similarities of regulatory networks in D. melanogaster sensory organ development and T lineage cells.</div></div>
