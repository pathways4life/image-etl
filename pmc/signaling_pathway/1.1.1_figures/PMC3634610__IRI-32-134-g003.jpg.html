These receptors share Syk as a primary downstream signaling kinase; however, the lack of a tri-acidic in CLEC-9A and the presence of an isoleucine prevent the endocytic and activation functions of this receptor. CLEC-2 utilises its tri-acidic motif to complement activation through Syk resulting in adhesion and clot formation in platelets. Dashed arrows represent a pathway that has yet to be fully defined.</div></div>
