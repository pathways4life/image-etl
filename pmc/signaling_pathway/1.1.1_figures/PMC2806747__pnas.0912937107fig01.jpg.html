From: Involvement of the Toll-like receptor 4 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> and use of TNF-? antagonists for treatment of the mucopolysaccharidoses. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) TLR4 signaling pathway can be activated via GAG fragments requiring CD44 and MyD88 or through LPS, which requires MyD88, LBP, and CD14. (B) CD44 adhesion receptor (55 kDa) is a hyaluronan-binding cell surface glycoprotein involved in the initiation of GAG-induced inflammation via TLR4. Elevated CD44 expression was detected in 6-month-old MPS VI rat FLSs and articular chondrocytes, confirming the activation of TLR4 via the GAG pathway in MPS. Protein kinase C-α (PKC-α; 82 kDa) was used as a loading control.</div></div>
