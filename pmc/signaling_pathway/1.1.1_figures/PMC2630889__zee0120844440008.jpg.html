From: Characterization of Thyrotropin Receptor Antibody-Induced <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Cascades. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Increasing concentrations (0.1, 1.0, and 10 Î¼g/ml) of TSHR blocking (A) and neutral (B) antibodies over a 60-min incubation showed variable changes in signaling molecules as shown in these representative immunoblots. The data (representing one set of experiments repeated three times) showed different signaling cascades induced by blocking and neutral antibodies. For example, the B2 blocking antibody increased several signaling molecules, the most important of which appeared to be the c-Raf/ERK pathway, whereas the 7G neutral TSHR antibody suppressed signaling molecules such as c-Raf/ERK. T16, also a neutral antibody, showed increasing activities of many signaling molecules including Akt, PKC, CREB, and c-Raf/ERK/p90RSK. By contrast, an isotype control monoclonal antibody (IgG2) did not produce such dose-dependent activities.</div></div>
