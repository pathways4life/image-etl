(A) Uterine horn on day 6 in which blastocysts along with BSA had been transferred on day 4. (B) Uterine horn on day 6 in which blastocysts along with sFRP1 had been transferred on day 4. (C) Uterine horn on day 6 in which blastocysts along with sFRP2 had been transferred on day 4. (D) Uterus on day 6 in which sFRP2-conditioned media along with embryoid bodies expressing sFRP2 had been injected in the right uterine horn on the morning of day 4. The left horn was not injected and served as a control. (E) Embryos dissected from a uterine horn that had been injected with sFRP2-conditioned media along with embryoid bodies expressing sFRP2 (Right) and embryos from the same uterus from the control uterine horn (Left).</div></div>
