From: Genetic Alterations in the Phosphatidylinositol-3 Kinase/Akt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in Thyroid Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic illustration of the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways driven by the increasing accumulation of genetic alterations in the progression from low-grade to high-grade thyroid cancers. In this model, primary genetic alterations in the MAP kinase pathway, such as the BRAF mutation, transform the thyroid cell into PTC. As the genetic alterations accumulate, particularly with those that can also activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, the cancer progresses into aggressive type, such as ATC. If primary genetic alterations, such as genetic or epigenetic silencing of PTEN, occur in the PI3K/Akt pathway, the thyroid cell is transformed into follicular thyroid tumors. As genetic alterations accumulate in this pathway, a follicular adenoma can progress into FTC when tumor invasion occurs, which can progress further into ATC when genetic alterations accumulate further, particularly if there are genetic alterations that can dually activate the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways, such as Ras mutations or genomic amplifications of the receptor tyrosine kinase genes. The increasing intensity of the gray tint in the circles represents increasing genetic alterations and the signaling pressure of the pathways in the progression from thyroid cells to benign thyroid tumors to differentiated thyroid cancers and to ATC.
