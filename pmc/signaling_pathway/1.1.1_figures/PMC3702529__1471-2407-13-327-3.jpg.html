(A)</b> Upon treatment of metformin (25 mM) in cervical cancer cells (C33A), the expression of FOXM1 diminished remarkably and the phosphorylation of AKT and AKT-specific phosphorylation of FOXO3a (Ser253) decreased concomitantly. <b>(B)</b> Co-treatment of PI3K/AKT inhibitor, LY294002 (10 Î¼M), inhibited p-AKT and concomitantly reduced the levels of FOXO3a (Ser253) and FOXM1 in C33A cells. <b>(C)</b> Depletion of endogenous FOXO3a in C33A cells using siRNAs showed that FOXO3a expression is required for the suppression of FOXM1 by metformin (25 mM) treatment.</div></div>
