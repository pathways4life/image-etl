Sulindac sulfide usually causes cellular growth suppression or cytotoxicity. As the compensatory mechanism, it also induces TSP-1 expression via ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Moreover, activated RhoA signals can enhance TSP-1 induction levels. All of the compensatory signals elevated cellular viability under the cytotoxic NSAID action.</div></div>
