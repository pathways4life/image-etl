Information that is known about the Hippo pathway in Drosophila is likely directly applicable to mammalian systems as it has been shown that mammalian homologs are capable of rescuing Drosophila mutants defective in Hippo signaling (6-8). The components of this pathway which are highly conserved in mammals include the following: YAP (Yes-associated protein), Lats1/2, Mob, Mst1/2, Sav, Merlin, Expanded 1/2, and Fat 4 (Figure 1) (5). Hippo (Hpo) and Warts (Wts), two significant core pathway components, belong to the Sterile 20 (Ste20) and Nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) serine/threonine protein kinase families, respectively (7,10-14). Salvador (Sav), a third major component of the Hippo pathway, is a scaffold protein with two WW domains and is homologous to the human ww45 protein (15,16). YAP, one of the highly conserved components in mammals, is considered to be a nuclear effector of the Hippo pathway (5,17). It has been noted that loss of critical components of the Hippo pathway can lead to uncontrolled cell growth, which implicates this as a tumor suppressor pathway (15).</div></div>
