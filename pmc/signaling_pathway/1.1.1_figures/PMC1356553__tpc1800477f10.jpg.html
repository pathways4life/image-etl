From: Arabidopsis TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN Interacts with RAPTOR, Which Regulates the Activity of S6 Kinase in Response to Osmotic Stress Signals. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">TOR Kinase Signaling Pathway in Plants.Data from this study support the existence of the plant TOR pathway modulating plant cell growth in response to stress. The basic skeleton of the pathway, as illustrated above, is conserved as in other eukaryotes. It remains to be answered whether the activity of plant TOR also requires the G-Î²-like (GBL) protein.</div></div>
