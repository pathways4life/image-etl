The functions of KLF4 involved in the mechanism of EMT.  From: Regulation of EMT by KLF4 in Gastrointestinal Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">EMT is a product of crosstalk between signaling pathways, including TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, FGF, STAT3 and EGF. By regulating the transcription factors (ZEBs, Snails and Twist), these signaling pathways switch the epithelial phenotype to mesenchymal phenotype. In cancer cells, KLF4 represses the EMT through interacting with TGF-β, Notch and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. The degradation of KLF4 through UPS is necessary to TGF-β induced transcriptional activation. In Notch signaling pathway, KLF4 negatively regulates the expression of Notch1 and functions as a negative modulator of Notch1 target genes’ transcription. KLF4 also interacts with Wnt/β-catenin by antagonizing the binding of β-catenin to TCF and represses the transcriptional activity of TCF.</div></div>
