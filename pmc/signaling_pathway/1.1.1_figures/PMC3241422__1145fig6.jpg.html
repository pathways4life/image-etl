(A) The Sln1 branch of the HOG pathway. The Sln1 osmosensor controls a phosphorelay pathway, which activates Skn7 under hypo-osmotic conditions to support cell wall biosynthesis and the Hog1 MAPK cascade under hyper-osmotic conditions. Active components are shaded. (B) Coordinate activation of CWI signaling, Ca2+ signaling, and Skn7. Rho1 may independently activate the Skn7 transcription factor (dashed line), which induces stabilization of the Crz1 transcripion factor, and may have additional effects on cell wall stress-induced transcription. The Mid1-Cch1 Ca2+ channel is activated by many of the same stresses that activate CWI signaling. Additionally, activation of Mpk1 results in stimulation of the Mid1-Cch1 Ca2+ channel, at least in response to ER stress, which activates the Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin. The Crz1 transcription factor is activated through dephosphorylation by calcineurin, which allows its entry to the nucleus. This interplay may coordinate control of gene expression by Ca2+ signaling and cell wall stress signaling.</div></div>
