Creation of an irreversible, self-perpetuating signaling circuit in a MAP kinase cascade by placing a constitutively-active form of one pathway component (KKK*) under transcriptional control of the pathway (Ingolia and Murray, 2007).B. A modified scaffold alters response dynamics in a MAP kinase cascade. Using leucine zippers to recruit new pathway regulators to the scaffold, signaling could be enhanced or dampened. Then, by placing expression of the recruited regulator under transcriptional control of the pathway itself, positive or negative feedback loops were established (Bashor et al., 2008). Several types of feedback circuit were constructed. Here, a pathway-induced positive regulator displaces a pre-existing negative regulator, creating a response that is switch-like rather than graded.</div></div>
