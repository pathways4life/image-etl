Ahnak protein interacts with R-Smad proteins for activation of R-Smad-dependent transcriptional regulation and with I-Smad for inhibiting I-Smad-mediated pathway, resulting in the downregulation of c-Myc and cyclin D protein. Downregulation of cyclin D initiates a series of events leading to the inactivation of CDK4 and dephosphorylation of Rb protein, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 stage. Thus, Ahnak serves as novel tumor suppressor through potentiation of TGFβ signaling.</div></div>
