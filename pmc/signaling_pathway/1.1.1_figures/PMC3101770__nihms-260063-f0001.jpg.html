The Toll signaling pathway and its multiple modes of activation in the Drosophila immune response. Three distinct mechanisms for microbial recognition, leading to the cleavage of Spätzle and activation of Toll, are illustrated. The mechanisms include peptidoglycan detection, by PGRP-SA, PGRP-SD and GNBP1, β-glucan detection through GNBP3, and protease activity sensing via the serine protease Persephone. All these detection modalities lead to the activation of the Spätzle processing enzyme (SPE) which converts this cytokine into its active form, for binding and activating Toll. The intracellular signal transduction downstream of Toll is very similar to the MyD88-dependent pathway, which functions downstream of most mammalian TLRs. The key features of this pathway include a trimeric receptor associated complex, containing MyD88, Tube and Pelle, which ultimately lead to the phosphorylation and degradation of the IκB homology Cactus and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB homologs Dif and Dorsal.</div></div>
