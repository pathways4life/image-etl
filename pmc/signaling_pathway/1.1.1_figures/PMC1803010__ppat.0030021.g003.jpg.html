OspF Inhibits the Yeast CWI <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> by Inhibition of MAPK Phosphorylation.  From: Yeast Functional Genomic Screens Lead to Identification of a Role for a Bacterial Effector in Innate Immunity Regulation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Summary of the activity of an RLM1-regulated Î²-galactosidase reporter in response to heat shock in the presence or absence of OspF.(B) Outline of the CWI pathway.(C) Yeast containing empty vector or a plasmid that conditionally expresses OspF were subjected to the designated stress 2 h after the induction of expression of OspF (see Materials and Methods). Representative immunoblots used to assay for activation of each of four MAPK signaling pathways: SLT2 (CWI pathway), FUS3 (mating pathway), KSS1 (invasive growth pathway), and HOG1 (high-osmolarity glycerol pathway) are shown. The circled P denotes phosphorylated versions of the proteins. The blots were probed with the anti-PSTAIRE antibody that recognizes CDC28 and PHO85 as a loading control. Each experiment was conducted at least in triplicate with similar results.</div></div>
