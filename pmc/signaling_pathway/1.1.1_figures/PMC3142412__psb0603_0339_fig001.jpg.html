The MAPK module promotes an auxin dependent phenotype due to the positive action of the CTR1 kinase on POLARIS expression. The ethylene module promotes an ethylene dependent phenotype due to the activation of ERF1. When the ethylene receptor is switched on (absence of ethylene) the MAPK module is activated and the ethylene module is inactivated. When the ethylene receptor is switched off by ethylene, the ethylene module is activated and the MAPK module is inactivated.</div></div>
