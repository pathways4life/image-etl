From: BowTieBuilder: modeling signal transduction pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Signaling pathway inferred from a gene regulatory network</b>. This figure depicts a bow tie inferred from membrane-bound proteins and TFs that were predicted to be active in a gene regulatory network [21]. The proteins in the bottom are the TFs, the proteins at the top are the membrane-bound proteins and the remaining proteins constitute the inferred signaling pathway. Different modules of this pathway are associated with different biological processes, where the core module is associated with exocytosis â€“ a process through which cells direct secretory vesicles out of the cell.</div></div>
