From: Dietary fiber enhances TGF-? <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and growth inhibition in the gut. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic illustration of the potential interaction of dietary fiber with the TGF-β signaling pathway. Upon binding to its receptors (TβRs) on the gut epithelial cells, TGF-β activates (or phosphorylates) Smad3 and inhibits Id2 expression. Butyrate, derived from dietary fiber in the gut, acts on the gut epithelial cells to increase Smad3 expression and subsequently to inhibit Id2 expression, thereby enhancing TGF-β-induced growth inhibition through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction.</div></div>
