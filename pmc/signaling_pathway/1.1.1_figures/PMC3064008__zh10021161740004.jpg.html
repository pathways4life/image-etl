To determine the relative component of MAPK signaling from G protein-mediated signaling, inhibitors of Gq- and Gi-mediated signaling were utilized. A: HEK-293 cells expressing the OXTR were pretreated with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31, which inhibits Gq-mediated signaling. Cells were then treated with 100 nM oxytocin at 2, 5, 10, 30, or 60 min and the cells lysed and processed on a Western blot and probed for p-ERK. Maximal p-ERK signaling in control cells occurred at 5 min and was diminished by ∼40–50% with Gq inhibition. Mean densitometry data from 6 independent experiments is illustrated. There is a significant decrease in maximal p-ERK signaling at 5 min (*P &lt; 0.5) compared with control (CTL), and repeated-measures 2-way ANOVA demonstrates the 2 curves to be different (†P &lt; 0.05). B: to determine the component of Gi-mediated signaling from the OXTR to the MAPK pathway, HEK-293 cells expressing the OXTR were pretreated with pertussis toxin (PTX) and then stimulated with an oxytocin time course. Mean densitometry data from 6 independent experiments illustrates an ∼30% decrease in maximal p-ERK signaling at 5 min (*P &lt; 0.05) compared with CTL, and repeated-measures 2-way ANOVA demonstrates that the 2 curves are different (†P &lt; 0.05). IB, immunoblotting.</div></div>
