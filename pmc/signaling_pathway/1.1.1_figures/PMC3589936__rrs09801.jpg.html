After the hTLR5 gene was obtained from CaCo-2 cells, sub-cloning strategy was applied to clone the hTLR5 into pcDNA3.1-V5/His B vector. Following digestion and expression verification by western blot (WB), the recombinant plasmid was transfected into cells, and hTLR5-mediated NF-kB signaling was assayed by treatment of flagellin. (<b>A</b>) Flow diagram for construction of the recombinant plasmid of hTLR5. (<b>B</b>) hTLR5 construct sub-cloning and identification with restriction enzyme digestion. (<b>C</b>) hTLR5 protein expression identified by WB. (<b>D</b>) Cell-based screening model that activates hTLR5-mediated NF-kB signaling. Dual-luciferase reporter gene expression that can be activated by flagellin via the NF-ÎºB intracellular signaling pathway mediated by TLR5. *P&lt; 0.05 vs. control.</div></div>
