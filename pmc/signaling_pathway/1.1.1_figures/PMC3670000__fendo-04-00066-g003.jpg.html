Estradiol can regulate GH actions in liver by modulating GH responsiveness which includes changes in hepatic GHR expression and crosstalk with GH-activated JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway. Estrogens can induce SOCS2 expression which in turn negatively inhibits GHR-JAK2-STAT5 signaling pathway.</div></div>
