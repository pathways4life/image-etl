From: EGFR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> promotes self-renewal through the establishment of cell polarity in Drosophila follicle stem cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">High levels of EGFR signaling in the FSC promote maintenance in the niche and the formation of basal and lateral domains while suppressing the formation of an apical domain. EGFR activates both the canonical Ras-mediated pathway leading to the phosphorylation of Erk, and the LKB1â€“AMPK pathway. Both Erk and AMPK are kinases that can regulate gene activity by activating transcription factors and phosphorylating proteins in the cytoplasm. AMPK directly promotes the lateral identity in polarized cells by activating lateral proteins. PKA is an upstream activator of LKB1 in follicle cells, and PKA can be activated by EGFR signaling, suggesting that EGFR signaling may activate LKB1 via PKA. EGFR signaling may suppress apical polarity either directly by regulating the transcription or activity of apical proteins, or indirectly by enhancing the activity of lateral proteins that suppress the localization of apical proteins. Low levels of EGFR signaling in prefollicle cells relieves this suppression, allowing apical domains to form and permitting differentiation away from the stem cell fate.<b>DOI:</b> http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04437.020</div></div>
