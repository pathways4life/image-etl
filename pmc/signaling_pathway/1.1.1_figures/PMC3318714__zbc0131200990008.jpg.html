ABA activates SPHKs through unknown mechanisms and ABA receptors may be involved. The activation of SPHKs produces phyto-S1P that activates PLDα1 to produce PA. PA inhibits ABI1 function but promotes NADPH oxidase to promote ABA-mediated stomatal closure. Meanwhile, PLDα1-produced PA stimulates SPHK activity through a positive loop. Arrows with solid lines indicate established links and arrows with dashed lines denote putative links.</div></div>
