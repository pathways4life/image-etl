In model 1, genetic alterations in any of the PI3K pathway members lead to amplification of PI3K signaling. In model 2, alterations of RTKs, RAS or PTEN in addition to mutant PIK3CA lead to activation of non-overlapping pathways or disrupt negative feedback loops to enhance PI3K signaling. In model 3, oncogenic RAS leads to tumorigenesis via a mechanism independent of PI3K. In model 4, loss of PTEN leads to p53-dependent cellular senescence, which may be overcome by acquisition of an additional mutation in the pathway. In model 5, activation of PI3K is enhanced through interactions with oncogenic RAS. PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RTKs, receptor tyrosine kinases.</div></div>
