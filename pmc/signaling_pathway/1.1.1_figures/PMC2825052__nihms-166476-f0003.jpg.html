From: Fine-tuning of GPCR activity by receptor-interacting proteins. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">GPCR signaling can be mediated by receptor-interacting proteins. A) Certain GPCR-interacting proteins can act as mediators of agonist-induced receptor signaling, independent of G protein- or arrestin-mediated signaling pathways. An example of this phenomenon is the interaction of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Jak2 with the angiotensin AT1 receptor. Association of Jak2 with the phosphatase SHP-2 and stimulation of AT1 with angiotensin II together promote Jak2 association with the AT1 receptor and initiation of Jak2-dependent signaling. Activated Jak2 can phosphorylate members of the STAT family of transcription factors, leading to STAT dimerization, translocation into the nucleus, and regulation of genes controlling cell growth. B) In other cases, the agonist-dependent dissociation of an interacting protein from a GPCR can alter the activity of an intracellular signaling pathway. For example, the interaction between the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the somatostatin type II receptor (SSTR2) is disrupted by agonist stimulation, leading to reduced PI3K-mediated Akt signaling and suppression of cell survival pathways.</div></div>
