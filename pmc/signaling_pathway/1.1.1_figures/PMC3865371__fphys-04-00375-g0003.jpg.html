From: Host-microbe interactions in the gut of Drosophila melanogaster. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>The Imd pathway and its negative regulators in the gut.</b> The Imd pathway is activated by the recognition of diaminopimelic acid-type peptidoglycan (DAP-PGN) by the membrane receptor PGRP-LC, or tracheal cytotoxin (TCT) by the intracellular receptor PGRP-LE. Activated PGRP-LC or PGRP-LE then recruits the adaptor protein Imd, which triggers the signaling cascade of the pathway and induces the nuclear translocation of Relish, a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factor of Drosophila. The NF-κB protein Relish activates the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and negative regulators of this pathway. PGRP-LB and PGRP-SC catalyze the degradation of peptidoglycan and TCT, resulting in a decrease in the amount of ligands for the recognition receptors PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE. PGRP-LF and Pirk inhibit the activity of those receptors, transglutaminase (TG) blocks the nuclear translocation of Relish, and Caudal modulates the transcriptional response of Relish.</div></div>
