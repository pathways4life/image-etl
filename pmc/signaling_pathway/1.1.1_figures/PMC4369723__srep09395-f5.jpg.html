T4 potentiates the EGF induced cellular proliferation and keratinization..  From: Integrating Clinical Indexes into Four-Diagnostic Information Contributes to the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Syndrome Diagnosis of Chronic Hepatitis B. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The proliferative signal of EGF is transmitted through two pathways: (1) JAK/STAT pathway and (2) Ras/MAPK pathway, ultimately causing activation of transcription factors such as c-Fos, STAT1 and STAT3, which all have important roles in proliferation and keratinization. T4 was reported to potentiate the EGF signaling through both the STAT pathway and the MAPK pathway.</div></div>
