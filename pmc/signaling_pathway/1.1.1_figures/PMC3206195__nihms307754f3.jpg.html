Phosphorylation of the Y515 residue allows recruitment of Shc/FRS-2, which subsequently activates the Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways. In contrast, phosphorylation of the Y816 residue allows recruitment of PLC, which activates the CAMK/CREB signaling pathway. Point mutations of the Y515 residue produce deficits in consolidation but not acquisition of fear conditioning 72. Point mutations of the Y816 residue, on the other hand, produce deficits in acquisition 72. Evidence exists for a role of BDNF signaling in the amygdala, hippocampus and PFC with respect to both the consolidation and extinction of fear conditioning.</div></div>
