From: Comparative Genomic Analysis of Drosophila melanogaster and Vector Mosquito Developmental Genes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The canonical Wnt pathway is summarized in this figure. Wnt binds its receptor Fz, which activates Dsh, an inhibitor of GSK-3. GSK-3 normally prevents dissociation of β-catenin from APC; when GSK-3 is inhibited, β-catenin enters the nucleus and regulates transcription (reviewed in [28]). Analysis of pathway members uncovered mosquito lineage specific changes in the number of orthologous sequences for genes encoding various Wnt pathway components in mosquitoes. With respect to D. melanogaster, mosquito lineage specific gene absences (−), as well as increases in the number of orthologues (+) were noted for particular pathway members. Details are provided in the text.</div></div>
