From: Role of the Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in Thyroid Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Genetic events involved in thyroid tumor initiation and progression</b>. Thyroid cell proliferation depends on the combined activation of cAMP/PKA, MAPK, and PI3K pathways, induced by TSH and other growth factors. Mutations of effectors along these signaling pathways play prominent roles in the pathogenesis of thyroid neoplasia. The figure represents a thyroid epithelial cell with the basal and apical membrane, and shows the tight and adherens junctions (TJ and AJ) between cells in order to form follicular structures. Activating mutations in TSHR or Gαs lead to constitutive activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway and give rise to hyperfunctional adenomas. There is evidence that constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway is required for PTC initiation. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is required for FTC initiation. Finally, deregulation of the p53 pathway and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is observed in ATC and has more to do with tumor progression.</div></div>
