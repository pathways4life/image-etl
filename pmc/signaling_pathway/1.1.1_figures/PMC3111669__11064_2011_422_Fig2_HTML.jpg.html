In the course of gastrulation, natural BMP-signal blocking occurs in BCNE through the physical interaction between BMP2/BMP4 and noggin/chordin. Three ways of experimentally blocking BMP signal in Xenopus embryos are shown: (1) dominant-negative type BMP receptor; (2) Smad6 (inhibitory Smad); and (3) Smad5-sbn (somitabun), which is thought to be deficient in binding to Smad4 and to form an inactive heteromeric complex with intact Smad5 and Smad1, resulting in efficient inhibition of the BMP signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of Smad1 by FGF/MAPK signaling (P on black background) occurs at a different amino acid position from that of BMP receptor-mediated phosphorylation (P on white background), and inhibits the transcriptional activity of Smad1. Natural inhibitory factors for BMP signaling are highlighted with gray</div></div>
