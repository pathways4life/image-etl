There, Ras signaling modules settle to elicit signal outputs. HRas is ubiquitinated and is recycled back to the PM, whereas KRas is sorted en route to LEs/MVBs. Once there, KRas can be GTP loaded, thus being able to recruit effectors such as Raf1, which initiates the MAPK signaling cascade on this compartment. Finally, KRas down-regulation/degradation may occur in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment. CCV, clathrin-coated vesicle.</div></div>
