Drosophila EGFR and FGFR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways..  From: EGFR and FGFR Pathways Have Distinct Roles in Drosophila Mushroom Body Development and Ethanol-Induced Behavior. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Schematic of EGFR pathway genes in this study. The EGFR ligands Vein (vn) and Spitz (spi) are synthesized as precursor peptides, which are cleaved to an active form by the protease Rhomboid (rho). These processed ligands are then secreted, and bind the receptor, Egfr. Bound receptor dimers initiate signaling that can activate a number of downstream pathways, most notably ERK and JNK MAP kinase cascades. (B) Schematic of FGFR pathway genes. Two FGFR receptors, Breathless (btl) and Heartless (htl) are activated by separate ligands â€“ Heartless by Pyramus (pyr) or Thysbee (ths), and Breathless by Branchless (bnl). FGFR activation can also initiate multiple downstream signaling pathways, including MAPK cascades.</div></div>
