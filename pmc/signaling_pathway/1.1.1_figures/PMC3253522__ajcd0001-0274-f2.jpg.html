A mutation in tropomyosin (E54K) is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and this mutation was investigated using transgenic mice expressing this mutant protein [44]. Proteomics revealed that decreased phosphorylation of tropomyosin may directly affect myofilament function and be part of the dilated cardiomyopathy signaling pathway in E54K transgenic mice.</div></div>
