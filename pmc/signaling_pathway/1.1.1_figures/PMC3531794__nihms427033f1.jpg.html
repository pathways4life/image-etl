From: Fifteen years of interleukin-27- discovery, advances and translation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Impact of IL-27 on lymphocyte signaling pathways. Dimerization of gp130 and IL-27Ra engages JAK1, 2 and Tyk2 that engage the MAPK pathway and activation of multiple STATs, most notably STAT1 and STAT3. The activation of STAT1 is linked to inhibition of GATA-3 and RoRÎ³t but upregulation of PD-L1, T-bet and IL-10. The ability to engage STAT3 is linked to increased proliferation as well as IL-10 while the MAPK pathway intersects with AHR to promote IL-10 and IL-21.</div></div>
