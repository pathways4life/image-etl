Inhibition of c-Kit <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>.  From: Characterization of c-Kit expression and activation in KSHV-infected endothelial cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">To confirm the activation of c-Kit signaling by KSHV, a series of kinase inhibitors were utilized. The diagram (A) depicts the c-Kit kinase-signaling pathway and where each inhibitor acts (modified from (Lennartsson et al., 2005a)). A p-Erk 1/2 immunoblot was performed on KSHV-infected cells pre-incubated with the indicated kinase inhibitors prior to 10 minutes of SCF stimulation (B, top blot). The blot was stripped and reprobed with antibodies to Erk 1/2 to measure total protein levels (B, bottom blot). The concentration (Î¼M) of inhibitor is indicated above the blots.</div></div>
