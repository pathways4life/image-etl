The only possible ErbB dimers in PCa are EGFR homodimers and ErbB1-ErbB2, ErbB2-ErbB3, and ErbB1-ErbB3 heterodimers (see text). All these dimers would stimulate cell survival, for example, though the PI3K/Akt pathway (shown) as well as by other pathways (not shown). ErbB1 inhibitors would disrupt ErbB homodimers and ErbB1-ErbB2 and ErbB1-ErbB3 homodimers, but signaling would still continue through the ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers. Similarly, ErbB2 inhibitors would prevent signaling downstream of ErbB1-ErbB2 and ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimers but allow signaling downstream of EGFR homodimers and ErbB1-ErbB3 heterodimers. However, dual inhibition of both EGFR and ErbB2 would inhibit all 4 dimers, thereby eliminating cell survival downstream of the ErbB receptors.</div></div>
