From: TWEAK-FN14 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> induces lysosomal degradation of a cIAP1-TRAF2 complex to sensitize tumor cells to TNF?. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Model for TWEAK killing.</b> TWEAK binding to FN14 induces the recruitment of a cIAP1–TRAF2 complex. This complex is then targeted for lysosomal degradation by the MVB pathway. The loss of cIAP1 or TRAF2 induces the stabilization of NIK and subsequent activation of noncanonical NF-κB. The canonical NF-κB pathway is also activated in response to TWEAK. Activation of NF-κB drives autocrine TNFα production in TWEAK-sensitive cell lines. The loss of cellular cIAP1 and TRAF2 by FN14 signaling prevents their recruitment to TNF-R1 upon autocrine TNFα binding, and this promotes the formation of a death-inducing complex and apoptotic signaling.</div></div>
