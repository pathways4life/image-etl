(A) The main chain of the filamentation pathway (KEGG Database), (B) PathFinder output for Sho1-Tec1 pair (100% recall, 12% precision). For (A), the dashed links indicate interactions that do not exists in the database. For (B), the interactions that were predicted as false negatives were shown with dashed lines. The proteins that were not on the main chain of any pathway were not colored, whereas proteins that are part of other pathways were colored.</div></div>
