PGE2 mediates Treg inhibition of effector T cell function through a PKA-mediated pathway. <b>(A)</b> In response to continuous antigen exposure, for instance in cancer and HIV, adaptive regulatory T cells express COX-2 and produce PGE2, which stimulates FOXP3 expression in these cells. The Treg-derived PGE2 can signal through the EP2 and EP4 receptors on effector T cells to inhibit the function of these cells through the pathway shown in <b>(B)</b>. Binding of PGE2 to its receptors on effector T cells stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity, which increases intracellular cAMP levels and thus activates PKA. Aided by an Ezrin-EBP50-PAG scaffold, PKA phosphorylates Csk, which in turn phosphorylates Lck to inhibit its activity. Lck normally acts to promote TCR signaling; thus Lck inhibition through this PGE2-initiated pathway inhibits TCR signaling in effector T cells.</div></div>
