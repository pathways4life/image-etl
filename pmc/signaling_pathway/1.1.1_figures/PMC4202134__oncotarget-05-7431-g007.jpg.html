The accumulation of intracellular ROS induces DNA damage-mediated p53 activation and dephosphorlation of Akt, which is negative regulated by PTEN. Inactivation of Akt and phosphorylation of p53 co-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, resulting in depletion of Δψm and release of apoptogenic factors from the mitochondria into cytosol. Furthermore, the activation of p53 increases the expression of death receptors, which accompany with mitochondrial pathway to promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis through activation of caspase cascade and PARP cleavage.</div></div>
