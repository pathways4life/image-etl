(A) Whole-mount β-galactosidase staining of a TCF/Lef-lacZ transgenic uterus injected with Wnt5a-conditioned media in both uterine horns. (B) Whole-mount β-galactosidase staining of a TCF/Lef-lacZ transgenic uterus injected with Wnt7a-conditioned media in both uterine horns. (C) Whole-mount β-galactosidase staining of a TCF/Lef-lacZ transgenic uterus injected with Wnt7a-conditioned media only in the right uterine horn. (D) A Cytodex-3 bead (bd) is approximately the same size as a wild-type blastocyst (bl). (E) A Cytodex-3 bead coated with Wnt7a-expressing cells. (F) Whole-mount β-galactosidase staining of a TCF/Lef-lacZ transgenic uterus injected with Wnt5a-coated Cytodex-3 beads.
