(<b>A</b>) Following induction of autophagy in vivo by starvation, RPE/choroid was isolated and levels of signaling intermediates determined. In the cKO samples p-AKT was decreased compared with Cryba1fl/fl, while p-MTOR was increased. Total AKT and total MTOR were not changed. (<b>B</b>) In starved RPE cells cultured from cKO mice, overexpression of CRYBA1 increased p-AKT and p-RPTOR expression, while p-MTOR decreased. (<b>C</b>) Conversely, downregulation of Î²A3/A1- crystallin expression in Cryba1fl/fl cells using siRNA, decreased p-AKT, and p-RPTOR while p-MTOR was upregulated. (<b>D</b>) Rapamycin, an inhibitor of MTOR, was effective at decreasing p-MTOR and increasing p-RPTOR levels in the cKO cells.</div></div>
