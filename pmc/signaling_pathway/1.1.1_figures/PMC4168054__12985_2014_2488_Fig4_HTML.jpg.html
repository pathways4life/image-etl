(A)</b> Hierarchical clustering the normalized and log2 transformed densitometric data of the expression levels of 109 protein kinases detected in primary multiplex Western blots of brainstem-cerebellums of scrapie-infected mice at 70, 90, 110, 130 dpi or at terminal stage of disease (TER). Red, higher expression level; green, lower expression level; grey, no data (protein kinases that were not resolved, not detected, or not quantitated due to transfer or blotting artifacts). Cluster (i) consists of protein kinases involved in the NMDAR-regulated CaMK4β signaling pathway. Cluster (ii) consists of protein kinases involved in the MST1 signaling pathway. The protein kinases highlighted in Figure 2, CaMK4β and DLK, are indicated by (●), and MKK7 is indicated by (◄). <b>(B)</b> Expression levels of protein kinases involved in the CaMK4β and MST1 signaling pathways, and included in the primary multiplex Western blots, at 70 dpi (top panel) and 130 dpi (bottom panel), respectively. Color bars indicate the levels in each of the three scrapie-infected mice normalized to those in mock-infected mice.</div></div>
