From: Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species Activation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Is Required for Hypoxia <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A signaling model for hypoxic activation of HIF-1. Based on our current findings we propose that hypoxia stimulates oxidant production within mitochondria. These oxidants interact with an unknown protein “X” in the cytosol to activate MKK3/6 and p38α MAPK. The activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway results in the decrease in hydroxylation of the HIF-1α protein at proline and asparagine residues resulting in the activation of HIF-1. By contrast, anoxia or iron chelators (DFO) during normoxia inhibit hydroxylation directly by limiting the availability of oxygen as a substrate and iron as a cofactor, respectively. Thus, anoxia or DFO does not require signaling pathways for the activation of HIF-1. Hypoxia and anoxia have distinct signaling mechanisms to activation HIF-1.</div></div>
