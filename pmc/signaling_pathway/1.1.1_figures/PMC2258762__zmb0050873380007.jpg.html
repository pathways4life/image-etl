From: Wingless <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Induces Widespread Chromatin Remodeling of Target Loci . </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The Notum locus is widely acetylated in response to Wg signaling in vivo. Da-Gal4 was used to drive expression of Wg (Da/Wg) or GPI-dFz2 (Da/GPI-dFz2) to ubiquitously activate or inhibit the pathway in embryos, respectively. (A) ChIP analysis indicates that TCF binds to the upstream Notum WRE region when the pathway is activated (black line) and inhibited (dashed line) but not the region containing the intronic WRE. (B) AcH3 ChIP analysis shows widespread increased acetylation across the Notum locus in response to Wg signaling (compare dashed and black lines). Each data point represents the mean of two independent ChIP samples, with the error bars indicating standard deviations. All experiments were performed multiple times, and the data shown are representative.</div></div>
