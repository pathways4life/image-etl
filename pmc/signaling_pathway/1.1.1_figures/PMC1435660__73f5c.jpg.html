From: Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, a Vascular Dysplasia Affecting the TGF-? <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The balanced signaling through TGF-β/ALK1 and TGF-β/ALK5 in healthy endothelial cells is broken in HHT patients. In HHT1 patients (endoglin mutated), the positive cooperation between endoglin and ALK1 is impaired and the ALK1 signaling pathway is partially abolished. The same is true when ALK1 is mutated in HHT2 patients. Thus, in a primary dysregulation of HHT endothelial cells, proliferation and migration would decrease and, consequently, ALK5 signaling and quiescence would prevail, compromising the angiogenesis process. However, ALK5 levels are decreased in these HHT endothelial cells as part of an adaptive response mechanism. Based on results by Fernández-L et al.75</div></div>
