Osteoblasts express HIF-1 and HIF-2 that transcriptionally activate EPO expression. In conditions of augmented HIF signaling (dashed line), osteoblasts produce both local and systemic levels of EPO that stimulate erythropoiesis in the bone marrow and spleen. Constitutive hyperactivation of HIF signaling leads to increased red blood cells (RBC) and oxygen in the blood that feeds back to suppress renal EPO production. Augmented HIF signaling in osteoblasts through VHL or PHD1/2/3 inhibition is sufficient to drive EPO expression in adult bone, elevate hematocrit, and protect mice from stress-induced anemia. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of PHDs using prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (PHI) is sufficient to activate EPO in adult bone. Additionally, augmented HIF activity in osteoblasts expands HSCs indicating that therapeutic manipulation of the PHD/VHL/HIF pathway in osteoblasts is a therapeutic strategy to elevate both EPO and HSCs in the local hematopoietic microenvironment.</div></div>
