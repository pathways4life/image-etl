From: Tumor Necrosis Factor-?

Activation of TAK1 leads to the activation of downstream kinases, including ERK1/2, p38, and IKK, which in turn leads to the activation of AP-1 or NF-κB transcription factors. TNF-α also activates Akt kinase, which leads to the activation of NF-κB transcription factor possibly through the activation of IKK. Activation and nuclear translocation of AP-1 and NF-κB results in the increased expression of the Mmp-9 gene resulting in production of the MMP-9 protein in extracellular environment.</div></div>
