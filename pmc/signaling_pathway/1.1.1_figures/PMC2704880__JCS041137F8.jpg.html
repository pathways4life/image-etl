Yeast epsins,  Ent1 and Ent2, bind Cdc42 GAPs Rga1 and Rga2 to activate Cdc42 signaling  towards cell polarity (Gic1/2-dependent) establishment pathways  (Aguilar et al., 2006). From  this study we propose that epsins (particularly Ent2) affect septin  organization pathways by interacting with another GAP, Bem3, which is also  involved in septin ring formation. This novel septin-regulatory circuit would  be redundant with another pathway (X), yet to be identified.</div></div>
