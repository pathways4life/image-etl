The ß-catenin-dependent pathway is involved in the stabilization of ß-catenin by the dissociation of a destruction complex that normally phosphorylates and targets ß-catenin for degradation. These signals require Fzd receptors to recruit the LRP co-receptor. ß-catenin-independent pathways encompass a broad range of outputs, dictated by the receptor context and downstream signals chosen. The newly discovered receptor tyrosine kinases Ror and Ryk provide another level of Wnt regulation in addition to Fzd. Within the Wnt family, there are 19 individual Wnt genes along with 10 different Frizzled receptors, illustrating the complexity governing this pathway and the multitude of Wnt-receptor combinations. The secreted Wnt inhibitors, Sfrps and Wifs, can regulate signaling in the extracellular space by sequestering Wnts away from their receptors. Wnt/ß-catenin-independent pathways can antagonize the ß-catenin-dependent pathway, revealing that these pathways are far more integrated than originally thought.</div></div>
