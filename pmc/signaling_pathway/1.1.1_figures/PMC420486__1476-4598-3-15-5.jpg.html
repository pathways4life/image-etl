Western blot analysis of MCF-7 cell extracts derived from 4 independent isolates overexpressing PLCδ4 (left 4 lanes) and 2 isolates transfected with control vectors (right 2 lanes) using antibodies against various phosphorylated forms of kinases and non-phosphorylated Erk1/2. Antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Blotting was done using the ECL Plus™ detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ).</div></div>
