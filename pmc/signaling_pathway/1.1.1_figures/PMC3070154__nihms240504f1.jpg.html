Cross-talk between estrogen and leptin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in POMC neurons.  From: Estrogen <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Hypothalamic Circuits Controling Reproduction. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Through a putative GPCR (mER), E2 (and STX) activates a PLCβ-PKCδ-AC-PKA pathway in POMC neurons that attenuates the coupling of μ-opioid and GABAB receptors to GIRK channels (heterologous desensitization) and triggers the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. This novel pathway also activates PKA-pCREB mediated transcription and in tandem with ERE-mediated transcription will alter the mRNA expression of relevant genes (channels and signaling molecules, etc.). Leptin binds to LRb to activate PI3 kinase and PLCγ1 to augment TRPC-channel currents and POMC neuronal excitability. Leptin will also activate JAK2-STAT3 transcriptional pathways. Note: The guinea pig, similar to the primate, has all of the key cellular elements in the mediobasal hypothalamus for controlling reproduction and energy homeostasis.</div></div>
