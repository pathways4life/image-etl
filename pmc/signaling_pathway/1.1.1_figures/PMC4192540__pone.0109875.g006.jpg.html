From: Targeted In Vivo Inhibition of Specific Protein-Protein Interactions Using Recombinant Antibodies. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Levels of the TCS:LUC induced luciferase activity correspond to the activity of the cytokinin signaling pathway activated with 100 nM trans-Zeatin (tZ) and normalized to the transfection control 35S:Renilla Luciferase. The ectopic expression of scFv hB7A is sorted by the amount of total (20 Âµg) co-transfected DNA (expressed in percent). The Col-0 wild type plants (white) and ahp 1,3,4,5 mutant plants with solitary active AHP2 (gray) show no significant effect. The ahp 1,2,4,5 mutant plants (black) with solitary active AHP3 were severely affected</div></div>
