From: Basement membrane remodeling is essential for Drosophila disc eversion and tumor invasion. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Co-option of a developmental pathway by invasive tumors. A model summarizing the relationships between JNK pathway, MMPs, TIMP, and RECK and their role in BM degradation during the developmental invasive process of disc eversion and tumor invasion. During the disc eversion process, both MMP1 and MMP2 are under the control of the JNK pathway and result in BM degradation. In tumor invasion, part of the developmental pathway is hijacked to affect BM degradation and invasiveness. MMP1 and MMP2 function is inhibited by TIMP and/or RECK. It is possible that RECK could also block other proteases activated by RasV12 and/or scrib−/−, which are independent from JNK signaling.</div></div>
