From: DOR. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model for DOR in mediating ABA-induced stomatal closure under drought stress. Arrows indicate the ABA signaling pathway for inducing stomatal closure in response to drought stress. DOR functions as a negative regulator of ABA biosynthesis and ABA further reduces the DOR expression. ABI1 acts as a negative regulator for both ABA-induced stomatal closure and DOR expression. DOR likely forms two negative feedback regulatory loops for ABA-induced stomatal closure.</div></div>
