The basic signaling cascade consists of a series of repressive interactions. Normally, in the absence of Shh, Gli proteins and target genes are actively repressed. When secreted Shh binds to its receptor Patched (Ptc/PTCH), the inhibition of Smoothened (Smo/SMOH), a G protein-coupled receptor that activates downstream intracellular components of the pathway, by Ptc is relieved.</div></div>
