There is also a disynaptic connection that terminates in the thalamus before reconverging in the PFC. When the thalamic response is reduced, the thalamic output is weakened. This attenuates the functional role of the accessory excitatory thalamic output to the PFC, and also reduces the capacity for seizures to be generated in the SB-PFC pathway.</div></div>
