(A) Fold changes in the expression of 84 genes relevant to the Wnt signaling pathway. Fold change in normalized gene expression in the Test Sample (TSA-treated MCF7 cells) divided by the normalized gene expression in the Control Sample (MCF7 cells). The middle line shows similar expression in both groups with 2-fold change boundaries. (B) Pathway activity score for Wnt signaling in experimental samples relative to control samples.</div></div>
