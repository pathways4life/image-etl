Signaling events modulated by tPA in the amygdala are indicated by black arrows, and those that occur in the NAc are indicated by red arrows. Components of the signaling pathway hypothesized to be altered in tPA−/− mice are shaded in gray. In the amygdala, acute cocaine exposure increases extracellular tPA activity in a CRF-dependent manner. tPA released into the extracellular space is hypothesized to modulate DA D1 receptor-mediated signaling to activate IEGs. In the NAc, tPA may modulate signaling through both D1 and NMDAR to modulate IEG expression. In the absence of tPA, cocaine-induced IEG expression is attenuated, thereby suggesting that tPA is an important component of the signaling cascade modulating cocaine-induced neuroadaptation.</div></div>
