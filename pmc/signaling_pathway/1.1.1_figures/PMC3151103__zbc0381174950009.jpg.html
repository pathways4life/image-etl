B, 0.25 μg of GST, 0.5 μg of GST-ERK2, or 2.0 μg of GST-pERK fusion proteins were initially bound with glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h, and then each complex was incubated with the active form of 0.5 μg of His-SIRT1 fusion proteins for 12 h. The protein complexes were detected by Western blotting with anti-GST (top) or anti-His antibody (bottom).</div></div>
