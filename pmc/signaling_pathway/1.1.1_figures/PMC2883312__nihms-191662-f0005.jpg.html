Regulation of CRF <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> by CRF1 isoforms.  From: Emerging role of alternative splicing of CRF1 receptor in CRF <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">CRF1 gene contains 14 exons and only one isoform of receptor–CRF1β (also called pro-CRF1) is coded by all exons. CRF1 transcript is also subjected to alternative splicing resulting in at least 8 isoforms. Recent studies showed that expression and/or co-expression of CRF1 isoforms is responsible for modulation of CRF1 signaling. Plus indicates stimulation of downsteam signaling by the classic pathway (CRF1α) or alternative pathway (CRF1β). Soluble isoforms (CRF1e and h) were also found to stimulate CRF signaling when co-expressed with CRF1α. Minus indicates inhibition of CRF signaling on different levels including: fast mRNA decay (CRF1e), dimerization and subsequent intercellular retention resulting in most probable premature receptor degradation (CRF1α with CRF1d, CRFf or CRFg), decoy receptor mechanism (CRF1h and e when secreted), agonist binding impairment (CRF1c) or G-protein wbinding inhibition (CRF1d).
