Dan, Bmp4, and HA are secreted molecules that contribute to proper semicircular canal development and are predicted to require the action of an Ncs-1/Pi4kb/Arf1 signaling pathway for their secretion. Bold arrows indicate activation, whereas the bold T indicates inhibition, of this signaling pathway. Thin arrows indicate directional flow of vesicles or proteins.</div></div>
