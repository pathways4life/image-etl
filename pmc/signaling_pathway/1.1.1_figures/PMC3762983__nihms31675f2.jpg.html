KLF11 targets in Panc1 cells were identified using pathway-specific arrays. Subsequently, a pathway was reconstructed using software that processes the data using semantic algorithms to search for available knowledge in literature databases (Pathway Assist; http://www.stratagene.com). The pathway depicted show interactions among proteins from a subset of proteins involved in transforming growth factor-Î² signaling.</div></div>
