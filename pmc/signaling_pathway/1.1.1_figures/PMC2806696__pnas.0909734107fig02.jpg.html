(A) A Venn diagram of genes bound by p53 with adriamcyin treatment from ChIP-chip and genes that were significantly altered in mESCs treated with adriamycin detected in gene expression microarray (false discovery rate corrected P value &lt;0.05). Only genes that were represented by both ChIP-chip and gene expression microarray platforms were included in the analysis. (B) Heatmap of genes in the Wnt signaling pathway enriched in the overlapped gene list shown in A. (C) Real-time PCR result of the fold induction of enriched genes in the Wnt signaling pathway in p53+/+ and p53−/− mESCs treated with adriamycin for 8 h. Results are displayed as mean ± SEM; n = 3; *P &lt; 0.05; ns, not significant. (D) Binding of p53 on the Wnt8a and Wnt3 genes from ChIP-chip.</div></div>
