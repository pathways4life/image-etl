The mechanistic <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> for inhibition of Ang II-induced MC contraction by synthetic triterpenoids.  From: The synthetic triterpenoid, RTA405, increases glomerular filtration rate and reduces angiotensin II-induced contraction of glomerular mesangial cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In MCs, Ang II generates ROS by activating NADPH oxdiases (NOX) through AT1 receptor signaling pathway. ROS subsequently raises [Ca2+]i either by stimulating Ca2+ release from endoplastic reticulum (ER)/sarcoplastic reticulum (SR) or by acutely activating Ca2+ permeable channels in the plasma membrane or both. An elevation of intracellular Ca2+ level triggers MC contraction and eventually results in a decrease in GFR. Synthetic triterpenoids bind to Keap1 in the cytoplasm of MC, which activates the Nrf2 transcription factor. In the nucleus of MCs, activated Nrf2 then promotes transcription of a variety of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes. The increased abundance of antioxidant enzymes reduces intracellular ROS produced by the Ang II signaling pathway, and consequently maintains an intracellular redox balance during Ang II stimulation (for simplicity, a classical Ang II-AT1 receptor signaling pathway was omitted).</div></div>
