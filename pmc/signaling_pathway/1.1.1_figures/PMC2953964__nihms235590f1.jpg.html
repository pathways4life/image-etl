Model of S1P Stimulated Fibroblast Contractility in Dupuytren’s Disease.  From: Dupuytren's Fibroblast Contractility by Sphingosine-1-Phosphate is Mediated through Non Muscle Myosin II. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">S1P is proposed to promote cell contractility through S1P2 activation of calcium-independent and calcium-dependent signaling pathways. In the calcium-dependent signaling pathway, MLCK is activated to phosphorylate MRLC. In the calcium-independent signaling pathway, ROCK is activated to phosphorylate MRLC and inactivate myosin light chain phosphatase. Activated MRLC bind to the neck domain of NMMII and activate actomyosin contractility. Actomyosin contractility is believed to cause Dupuytren’s disease. S1P stimulates fibroblast contractility through S1P2 receptor mediated calcium-dependent and -independent pathways.</div></div>
