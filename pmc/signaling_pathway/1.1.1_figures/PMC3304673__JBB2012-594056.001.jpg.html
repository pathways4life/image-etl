From: Effects of IRF5 Lupus Risk Haplotype on Pathways Predicted to Influence B Cell Functions. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Association of the canonical interferon pathway with the IRF5 haplotype. Na√Øve B cells were either exposed to EBV for 16 hours or left unstimulated. Whole-genome expression levels were compared between cells with the risk and protective haplotypes using the Illumina platform. Significant association of the data set with the canonical IFN pathway was discovered using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (P &lt; 0.01). Interactions between genes in the interferon pathway based on Ingenuity Pathway Analysis are shown for both the unstimulated (a) and the EBV-infected conditions (b). Blue gene symbols represent genes with relatively lower expression in the cells with the risk haplotype, while genes with red shading are upregulated in the risk cells.
