From: Cancer Therapy-Induced Cardiac Toxicity in Early Breast Cancer: Addressing the Unresolved Issues. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Mechanisms underlying molecularly targeted therapeutics-induced cardiac toxicity. Inhibition of Nrg1/ErbB receptors with HER2-directed therapies impacts numerous signaling pathways resulting in 1) suppression of myofilament protein synthesis via the PI3K-Akt pathway, 2) suppression of protein hypertrophy via the MAPK pathway, 3) suppression of cell survival via Src/Fak pathway, 4) upregulation of protein degradation via FOXO signaling. Fak indicates focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; NO, nitric oxide; Nrg1, neuregulin-1Î²; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.</div></div>
