From: How CYCLOPS keeps an eye on plant symbiosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Two alternative models for the role of CYCLOPS in symbiosis signaling. (A) The model of the Sym pathway according to Yano et al. (1). Symbiotic signals are perceived by appropriate receptor complexes, activation of which will lead to a signaling cascade within the Sym pathway. Because cyclops mutants show spontaneous nodulation it is interpreted that CYCLOPS acts as a branching point in the pathway, where fungal and bacterial infection are regulated in a CYCLOPS-dependent manner and nodule organogenesis is regulated in a CYCLOPS-independent manner. This finding suggests that NSP1, NSP2, and ERN1 transcription factors have dual roles in both the bacterial infection branch and the nodule organogenesis branch as mutants in these genes are impaired in both. (B) An alternative model for the Sym pathway. Because cyclops mutants show greatly reduced levels of spontaneous nodulation it is interpreted that CYCLOPS is required for nodule organogenesis, but that the cyclops mutants have low penetrance. Low penetrance allows a more parsimonious Sym pathway in which CYCLOPS has analogous functions to all other members of the Sym pathway. The pathway bifurcates into nodulation-specific and mycorrhization-specific branches, each governed by their own set of transcription factors. NF, Nod factor.
