From: Comprehensive identification of essential pathways and transcription factors related to epilepsy by gene set enrichment analysis on microarray datasets. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Hierarchical clustering of genes involved in peroxisome proliferato-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway related to epilepsy. In total, there were 68 genes involved in the PPAR signaling pathway related to epilepsy, which may be clustered into 4 gene set groups (groups Aâ€“C) based on hierarchical clustering with Pearson correlation coefficient. Heatmap of 68 genes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway in 5 epilepsy samples (from EP-1 to EP-5) and 5 control samples (non-epilepsy, from CT-1 to CT-5) is shown. EP, epilepsy; CT, control.</div></div>
