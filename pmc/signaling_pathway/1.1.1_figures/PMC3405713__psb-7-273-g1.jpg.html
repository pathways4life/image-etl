Phosphorylation occurs at a conserved region within the peptide-binding domain (PBD) of BiP 4  and is associated to an inactive state of the protein that can be efficiently converted into an active, dephosphorylated form in response to increased protein synthesis or specific ER stress. Regulation of BiP function by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events is therefore coordinated with nutritional and environmental inputs via the TOR pathway and ER stress signaling components.</div></div>
