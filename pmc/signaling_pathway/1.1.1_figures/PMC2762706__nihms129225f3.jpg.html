Genes colored in dark gray indicate up-regulated genes and in light gray represent down- regulated genes in DM patients. None of the genes in this pathway were up- or down- regulated in ND patients at 4d post CPB/C. Data was analyzed through the use of Ingenuity Pathway analysis (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com). DM: patients with diabetes mellitus; ND: patients without diabetes mellitus.</div></div>
