From: The TSC-mTOR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> regulates macrophage polarization. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for how mTORC1 activity controls macrophage polarization. <b>a.</b> Physiological induction of the Akt-mTORC1 signaling loop by IL-4 stimulation (left) allows for transient, inducible activation of the pathway, and enables Akt to synergize with the JAK/STAT pathway for M2 polarization. mTORC1 activity is also regulated by nutrient availability (not shown here), so such wiring of the signaling pathway may allow calibration of M2 activation to metabolic status (left). In contrast, constitutive or aberrant mTORC1 activation corrupts this signaling pathway and modulation of macrophage activation by metabolic inputs (right). (Green = activation; Red = inhibition; Black = attenuated) <b>b.</b> Constitutive or aberrant activation of mTORC1 impairs the ability of macrophages to respond appropriately to polarizing stimuli. A critical mediator of this process is Akt, whose activity is downregulated by increased mTORC1 activity.</div></div>
