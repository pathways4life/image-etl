The canonical RTK-Ras-ERK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> and alternative Ras-dependent pathways in C. elegans.  From: Canonical RTK-Ras-ERK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and related alternative pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A) The canonical pathway. Positively acting factors are shown in green; negatively acting factors are in red. Only the most widely required and conserved factors are shown. GF, growth factor. TX, transcription. B) LET-23/EGFR and C) EGL-15/FGFR both act in part through the canonical pathway, but they are activated by different ligands and control different sets of developmental processes. Included in B) are nuclear proteins, including two MPK-1/ERK substrates (LIN-1/ETS and EOR-1), that are jointly important for most LET-23-dependent somatic cell fates. Downstream targets of EGL-15-Ras-ERK signaling are not yet known. D) Ras-ERK functions to promote meiotic pachytene progression and various other aspects of germline development; the receptors that activate Ras-ERK for these functions are not currently known. MPK-1/ERK utilizes more than 30 different substrates in the germline. E) A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) may activate Ras-ERK signaling in some contexts. F) LET-60/Ras can signal through the alternative Ral pathway. See text for additional details and references.</div></div>
