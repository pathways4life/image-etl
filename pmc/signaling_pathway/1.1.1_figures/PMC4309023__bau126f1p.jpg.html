This figure clearly depicts that KEGG, SPAD and STKE can be thought as the pioneers in the field of the development of human cell signaling databases. In the subsequent years, the evolution of human cell signaling databases is mainly led by the ‘Commercial Groups’ and several ‘Academic Groups’. The first commercial database, BIOCARTA and GENEGO were launched in 2000. In the subsequent years, several databases, like Cell Signaling TECHNOLOGY (2002), PROTEIN LOUNGE (2003), INVITROGEN (2005), Applied Biosystems (2007) and MILIPORE (2009) were also started to provide human cell signaling data freely to the users. By integrating the signaling pathway components with corresponding antibodies, drugs and inhibitor molecules, these commercial databases are promoting the bench biologists to order and purchase those products more conveniently from their websites. On the other hand, the evolution of the other branch of the human cell signaling database is been continuously developed and monitored by several academic research groups across the world. Since 1995, almost each year, on an average one or two such databases are launched. The objectives of these databases are wider than the commercial databases and are not only restricted to the pathway data annotation and presentation but also to the analysis of cross talks of multiple pathways, drug target identification, in silico simulation, development of computer readable pathway data sharing process and pathway analysis, etc.</div></div>
