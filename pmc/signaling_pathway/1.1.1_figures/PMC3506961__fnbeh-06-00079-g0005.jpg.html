(A)</b> The medial and lateral shell both support a dual pathway circuit that converges on dopaminergic neurons in the VTA: a direct pathway originating from a population of D1 receptor expressing striatal projection neurons, and an indirect pathway originating from a mixed population of D1 and D2 receptor expressing striatal projection neurons [see (Humphries and Prescott, 2010) for review]. This arrangement is consistent with the shell's role as a “critic”: the pathways support the computation of a prediction error between the prediction transmitted by the direct pathway and the actual outcome transmitted by the indirect pathway (PPn, pedunculopontine nucleus; VP, ventral pallidum). <b>(B)</b> Simulation of neural population activity showing how a greater outcome (indirect pathway) than predicted (direct pathway) drives a phasic increase in VTA activity, signaling a positive prediction error. <b>(C)</b> Simulation of neural population activity showing how a lower outcome (indirect pathway) than predicted (direct pathway) drives a phasic dip in VTA activity, signaling a negative prediction error. Simulation details given in Humphries and Prescott (2010).</div></div>
