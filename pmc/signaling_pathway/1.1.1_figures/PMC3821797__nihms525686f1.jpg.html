From: B cell survival. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">TRAF2 and TRAF3 cooperatively and constitutively repress the alternative NF-κB pathway, with BAFF-R signaling relieving this suppression. In all reports describing deficient BAFF-R signaling, blunted naive mature B cell survival and development is the result (<b>a</b>). When BAFF-R signaling is deficient, TRAF3 and TRAF2 cooperate to constitutively degrade NIK and thus block activation of the alternative NK-κB pathway (<b>a</b>). It is thought that both TRAF2 and TRAF3 bind to NIK and cooperate in its degradation, with the heterocomplex of TRAF2/TRAF3/NIK depicted in (<b>a</b>) purely hypothetical. Upon ligation of BAFF-R by BAFF (<b>b</b>), TRAF3 is recruited to an atypical TRAF3-binding site located in the cytoplasmic tail of BAFF-R (depicted by the amino acid sequence PVPAT).6 TRAF3 is then targeted for degradation in a TRAF2-dependent manner. Owing to depleted TRAF3 levels, NIK is no longer the subject of continual degradation and can activate the alternative NF-κB pathway. Through NF-κB2 signaling, B cell survival and the transitional B cell developmental checkpoints occur.</div></div>
