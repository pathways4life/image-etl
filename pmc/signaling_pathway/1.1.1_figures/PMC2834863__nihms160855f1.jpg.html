General overview of TGF-β <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>.

Once activated TGF-β is able to bind type II TGF-β receptor homo-dimers (TβRII) thereby permitting the efficient transactivation of type I TGF-β receptor homo-dimers (TβRI). As a result of receptor activation by TGF-β, downstream SMAD dependent and SMAD independent signaling is initiated. However, the level of downstream pathway activation is dependent the abundance of receptor associated TGF-β signaling repressors such as SMAD7, STRAP, YAP65, SMURF1, SMURF2, GADD34 and PP1. SMAD dependent signaling has been primarily associated with activation of SMAD2 or SMAD3, however it has now been shown that SMAD1 and SMAD5 can be activated by TGF-β. Once SMAD1, SMAD2, SMAD3 or SMAD5 are activated they are able to associate with SMAD4 to co-activate or co-repress transcription. Importantly, SMAD dependent signaling can also be repressed by complex association with other transcription factors, co-activators or co-repressors such the c-Ski or SnoN proto-oncogenes. The SMAD independent pathways are known to include ShcA, RHO, RAC/CDC42, RAS, TRAF6, TAK1, PI3K, PAR6, MAP3K1, DAXX and PP2A. Together, the balance of SMAD dependent signaling, SMAD independent signaling and the presence or absence of signaling repressors ultimately determines the response to TGF-β in vitro or in vivo.</div></div>
