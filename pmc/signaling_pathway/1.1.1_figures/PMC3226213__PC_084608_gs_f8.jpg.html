From: Arabidopsis Class I KNOTTED-Like Homeobox Proteins Act Downstream in the IDA-HAE/HSL2 Floral Abscission <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>[C][W][OA]. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Models of IDA Signaling.<b>(A)</b> to <b>(C)</b> IDA can be imagined to bind the extracellular LRRs of a HAE homodimer <b>(A)</b>, a HSL2 homodimer <b>(B)</b>, or a HAE-HSL2 heterodimer <b>(C)</b> and to cause autophosphorylation (P) of the kinase receptor domains. The protein phosphatase KAPP dephosphorylates HAE and returns the receptor to an off state (Stone et al., 1994).<b>(D)</b> The signal from IDA-HAE/HSL2 is suggested to be transduced via a MAPK cascade that includes MKK4, MKK5, MPK3, and MPK6. Genetic evidence suggests that BP/KNAT1 acts as a negative downstream component of this signaling pathway by restricting cell wall degradation and consequently cell separation and the expression of KNAT2 and KNAT6. Upon activation of the IDA signaling pathway, the BP/KNAT1 restriction of KNAT2 and KNAT6 is elevated, and these transcription factors can act as positive regulators of floral organ separation. In addition, BP/KNAT1 is a positive regulator of EVR, which influences cell elongation by a separate parallel pathway (Leslie et al., 2010).</div></div>
