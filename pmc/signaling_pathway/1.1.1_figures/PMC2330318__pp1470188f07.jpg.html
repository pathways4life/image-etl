From: Nitric Oxide Triggers Phosphatidic Acid Accumulation via Phospholipase D during Auxin-Induced Adventitious Root Formation in Cucumber. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic model of the PL signaling pathway induced by auxin during AR formation in cucumber. NO acts downstream of auxin (IAA) to trigger PIP, PIP2, and PA accumulation. PLD is involved in PA formation induced by NO. PLD could be activated by PIP and PIP2 increases and/or by other NO-mediated pathways (see “Discussion” for details). PLD-derived PA induces AR formation. The solid arrow denotes the enzymatic pathway. Dashed arrows denote regulatory pathways. The question mark denotes a yet undescribed pathway for PLD activation in cucumber.</div></div>
