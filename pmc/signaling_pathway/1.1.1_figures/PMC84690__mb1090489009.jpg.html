From: Cas Mediates Transcriptional Activation of the Serum Response Element by Src. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model for Cas-mediated activation of the SRE. Kinase-active Src directly binds to Cas. This association leads to the coupling of Grb2 with Shc and Shp-2 by yet undetermined means. The induced association of Grb2 with Shc and/or Shp-2 may signal to the Ras/Mek/Erk pathway. Activation of the Erk MAPK pathway can then lead to SRE-dependent transcriptional activation. Other Src-dependent signaling pathways that are not shown may also result in activation of Ras and signaling to SREs.</div></div>
