The autoactivation of nodule organogenesis by CCaMK (DMI3) is dependent on NIN. Calcium spiking and the induction of ENOD11 expression are normal in Mtnin-1, demonstrating that NIN functions downstream of the early NF signaling pathway (indicated by bracket). All of the components of the early NF signaling pathway are also required for the induction of NIN expression. In addition, the expression of ENOD11 outside of the root responsive zone is suppressed by NIN. Recently published data demonstrates that nodule organogenesis requires cytokinin signaling in the root cortex (shown in gray), which is dependent on both NIN and NSP2. The NIN gene is also required for bacterial infection (as is HCL), suggesting NIN is involved in both epidermal and cortical cell responses. The precise relationship between HCL and NIN cannot be resolved in the work presented here. However, given that HCL expression does not depend on the early NF signaling pathway and autoactive CCaMK induces nodules to form in the hcl mutant, we conclude that HCL is not downstream of early NF signaling leading to nodule organogenesis. Arrows do not imply direct interactions.</div></div>
