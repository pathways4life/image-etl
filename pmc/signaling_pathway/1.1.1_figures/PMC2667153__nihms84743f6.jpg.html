A, B: To illustrate transgene expression following heat-shock, in situ hybridization was performed for gfp. Widespread clonal expression was observed in the retinas in 85% of embryos. C–F: Expression of Bmp4 caused a clear expansion of tbx5 in embryos not expressing Dkk1 (D) and rescue of tbx5 in embryos expressing Dkk1 (F). G–L: Activation of Wnt signaling does not rescue dorsal markers in the absence of Bmp signaling. Embryos heterozygous for the Tg(hsp70l:nog3)fr14 transgene, which express the Bmp pathway inhibitor Noggin upon heat-shock, were outcrossed to TL strain fish and placed in 200 mM LiCl at 18 hpf. A 2 hour heat-shock was performed at 18 hpf, and embryos were fixed at 24 hpf. To illustrate Wnt pathway activation, TOP:dGFP embryos were similarly treated with LiCl from 18–24 hpf and gfp detected by in situ hybridization (G, H). For hs:Noggin embryos untreated with LiCl, 55% of 49 embryos lost expression of tbx5 (J), and for embryos treated with LiCl, 57% of 122 embryos lost expression of tbx5 (L), showing that activation of Wnt signaling cannot rescue tbx5 in the absence of Bmp signaling.
