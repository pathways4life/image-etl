Activated MAVS interacts with STING, which dimerizes, leading to the activation of IKK complex, TBK1 and IKKε [8]. The activation of this complex leads to the ubiquitination of RIG-I, STING, IRF-3 and TBK1 and the phosphorylatin of STING and IRF-3. Activated the transcription factor IRF-3 translocates to the nucleus inducing production of IFN. (<b>B</b>) Coronavirus papain-like protease domains (depicted here as PLP) interact with STING to block signaling by blocking assembly or stability of STING dimers and preventing the ubiquitination of signaling proteins, such as RIG-I, TBK1, and IRF-3.</div></div>
