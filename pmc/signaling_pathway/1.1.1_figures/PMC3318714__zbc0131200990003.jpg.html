The epidermal peels were incubated in stomatal incubation buffer containing 10 μm phyto-S1P or 10 μm phyto-S1P plus 0.1% 1-butanol. Asterisks indicate that the mean value is significantly different from that of the samples treated with phyto-S1P at p &lt; 0.05 based on Student's t test. B, PA (18:1/18:1) induces stomatal closure in WT and mutants. Epidermal peels were treated with 50 μm PA. All values are mean ± S.E. (n = 50) in the stomatal assays.</div></div>
