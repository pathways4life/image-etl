ERK was activated by phosphorylation on Thr202/Tyr204 (P-ERK). Treatment of TLR-stimulated THP-1 cells with L. reuteri 6475, histamine, or U0126 suppressed activation of ERK1/2, an effect that was significantly blocked in the presence of ranitidine. The Î²-actin antibody served as the protein loading control.</div></div>
