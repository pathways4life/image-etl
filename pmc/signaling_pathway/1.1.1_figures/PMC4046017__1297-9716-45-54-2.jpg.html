From: From mouth to macrophage: mechanisms of innate immune subversion by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Inhibition of IFNg signaling by MAP.</b> MAP infection inhibits JAK-STAT signaling via increased expression of negative regulators of the IFNγ receptor, SOCS1 and SOCS3, as well as decreased expression of IFNγ receptor chains 1 and 2. These modifications of cellular responsiveness occurred in temporal fashion with early induction of SOCS1 and 3 with subsequent repression of the IFNγ receptor. MAP inhibition of IFNγ responsiveness may be mediated by MAP effector molecule PtpB. PtpB may disrupt the normal IFNγ receptor immune signaling pathway by dephosphorylating a key signaling intermediate, or perhaps the receptor itself.</div></div>
