(<b>B</b>) Relative densitometric analysis of the protein bands was performed and presented. Nano-SiO2 inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. ANOVA followed by the LSD method are used for the data analysis. Data are expressed as the mean Â± standard deviation from three independent experiments (*P&lt;0.05).<b>Abbreviations:</b> PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Nano-SiO2, silica nanoparticles; ANOVA, one-way analysis of variance; LSD, least significant difference.</div></div>
