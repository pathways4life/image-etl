From: Integrative Multi-omics Module Network Inference with Lemon-Tree. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Copy number alterations for a selection of predicted hub regulators are indicated for canonical glioblastoma signaling pathways p53, RB and RTK/PI3K. Genes selected by the algorithm are indicated in black boxes, while light grey boxes depict genes that were not selected by the algorithm but are key factors for the pathway. Purple hexagons indicate phenotypes. Percentage of copy gain or loss is indicated by value and by color shades of red for gene gains and green for gene losses. The values are taken from GISTIC putative calls for low-levels gains or single-copy losses on 563 glioblastoma samples (data from the Broad institute).</div></div>
