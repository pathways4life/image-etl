Increased expression of IGF-IR, or IGF-IR interaction and crosstalk with HER2 have been reported in models of Herceptin resistance. PI3K signaling has been implicated as a potential mechanism of IGF-IR-mediated Herceptin resistance. Inhibition of IGF-IR has been shown to increase sensitivity to Herceptin in preclinical studies.</div></div>
