A model of the metabolic stress response regulation by oncogenic BRAF in melanoma cells..  From: Uncoupling of the LKB1-AMPK? Energy Sensor <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> by Growth Factors and Oncogenic BRAFV600E. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Resistance to stress conditions is essential for melanoma cells survival. We propose that oncogenic BRAFV600E signaling (left panel) protects to apoptosis by regulating BH3-family members and confers resistance to low energy conditions promoting the uncoupling of LKB1 and AMPK through Erk1/2 and p90Rsk. Under this condition BRAF mutant cells have a limited response to low energy conditions. On the right panel the inhibition of BRAF signaling allows the formation of the LKB1-AMPK complexes restoring the energy stress pathway and promoting the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl1. The activation of AMPK by metabolic stress conditions and the inhibition of BRAF signaling would have synergistic effects promoting apoptosis.</div></div>
