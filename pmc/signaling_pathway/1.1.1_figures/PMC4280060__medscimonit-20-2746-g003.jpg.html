The SK-N-BE(2) or SH-SY5Y cells expressed more CXCR4 after co-culture with THP-1-derived macrophage cells. The upregulation of CXCR4 expression was inhibited after treatment with PDTC. NF-κB(p65) and CXCR4 expression was measured by Western Blot. β-actin was used as the loading control. CO: co-culture. *P&lt;0.05 vs. co-culture group. Data are expressed as mean ±SD.</div></div>
