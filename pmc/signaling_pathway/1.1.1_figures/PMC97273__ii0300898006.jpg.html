From: Synergistic Epithelial Responses to Endotoxin and a Naturally Occurring Muramyl Peptide. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of TCT and endotoxin signaling. TCT and LPS each act through cell surface receptors to induce differential signaling events, which combine synergistically to activate a unique H7-sensitive kinase. Direct activation of PKC by PMA can produce a signal that mimics TCT, in that it can synergize with LPS in the same manner as does TCT. However, TCT and LPS signaling pathways do not proceed via PKC, since the PKC-specific inhibitor calphostin C does not block effects of TCT and LPS but does block effects of PMA and LPS. The signaling pathway induces IL-1α, causing induction of iNOS and the production of NO·, which leads to cytostasis. Note that while the PMA-stimulated pathway may not proceed through the same kinase as TCT and LPS, the depiction is consistent with our data.</div></div>
