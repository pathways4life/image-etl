Increased c-FLIP levels may decrease the apoptosis of Osteoclast. The osteoclast apoptosis signal transduced by TRAIL/TRAILR2 was transformed to activate NF-κB. A key step in downstream signaling of RANKL/RANK is binding of TRAFs to RANK. Stimulation of RANK also results in strong NF-κB activation. NF-κB1(p50) is an important signal for osteoclast development and osteoclast function.</div></div>
