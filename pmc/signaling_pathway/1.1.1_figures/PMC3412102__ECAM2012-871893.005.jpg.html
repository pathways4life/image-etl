(a) The expression of phosphor-ERK or -Akt was examined in HCT116 cells treated with HRT in a time-dependent manner. HRT induced dephosphorylation of Akt not ERK at 24 h. (b) The effect of HRT on PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Phosphorylation levels of Akt, mTOR, and GSK3β were examined in HCT116 cells treated with LY294002 (10 μM), HRT (300 μg/mL) or cotreated with LY294002 and HRT for 24 h.</div></div>
