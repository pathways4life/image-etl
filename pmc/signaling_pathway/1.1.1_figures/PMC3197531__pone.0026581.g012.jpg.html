Akt-induced phosphyrylation of GSK-3α/β inhibits its activity, thereby nullifying its anti-hypertrophic effect. Akt-induced phosphorylation of FOXOs also inhibits ist activity, negating its effects on activation of atrogin-1 and MuRF1, which results in decreased protein breakdown (atrophy). These multiple signaling scenarios likely contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and/or the anti-atrophic effect following sustained βAR stimulation. “→” represents activation, “⊣” represents inhibition.
