A, Using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, genes involved in apoptosis signaling were shown to be regulated by hGRα+DEX, including Bcl-xL (down-regulated) and CASP6 (up-regulated) (n = 3; *, P &lt; 0.01). B, Ingenuity Pathways Analysis of genes involved in apoptosis signaling and regulated by hGRdim4+DEX. These included cIAP2 (up-regulated) and Gas2 (up-regulated) (n = 3; *, P &lt; 0.01). C, Total RNA was isolated from hGRα, hGRdim, and hGRdim4 cells treated with 100 nm DEX for 6 h and gene regulation analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. Four genes involved in apoptosis signaling were shown to be differentially regulated by hGRα (Bcl-xL and CASP6) or hGRdim and hGRdim4 (cIAP2 and Gas2) (n = 3; *, P &lt; 0.01).
