(A)</b> Bisphosphonates bind to phosphatases present in the cell membrane. This induces Cx43 hemichannel opening, followed by activation of the kinases Src and MEK, and ERKs. ERKs activated downstream of Cx43 hemichannel opening are retained in the cytoplasm by a complex formed by βarrestin and clathrins. This leads to the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic targets p90RSK, BAD and C/EBPβ, which results in osteoblast and osteocyte survival. <b>(B)</b> Mechanical stimulation induces α5β1 integrin engagement and the association of the integrins with Cx43, by a mechanism that requires the protein 14-3-3θ. This results in hemichannel opening and the release of PGE2. PGE2, in turn, activates EP2/4 prostaglandin receptor by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism, leading to activation of the cAMP/PI3K signaling pathways, accumulation of βcatenin with the consequent activation of Wnt signaling, and inhibition of osteocyte apoptosis. <b>(C)</b> Parathyroid hormone (PTH), through binding to the PTH receptor, induces activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Cx43, by sequestering β-arrestin away from the PTH receptor, facilitate cAMP/PKA-mediated downstream signaling and osteoblast survival.</div></div>
