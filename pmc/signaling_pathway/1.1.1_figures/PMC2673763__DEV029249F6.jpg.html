Tracheas displayed normal, low levels of mucous  differentiation, identified by Muc5AC staining (green) (A). Addition of IL13  (B) or DLL4 (C) induced mucous metaplasia. (<b>A′-C</b>′)  Immunohistochemistry of Stat6–/– tracheas that  were harvested at E14.5 and cultured for 7 days. Tracheas displayed normal,  low levels of mucous differentiation (A′). Addition of IL13 (B′)  failed to induce mucous metaplasia as predicted. Addition of DLL4 (C′)  induced mucous metaplasia. (<b>D</b>) Possible models for the interaction of  Notch and the IL13/Stat6 signaling pathway, which both result in mucous  metaplasia. Notch signaling cannot be upstream of Stat6 activation as  Notch-induced metaplasia occurs in Stat6-null trachea. Notch  signaling might be downstream of Stat6 signaling, although this is unlikely  because Stat6 activation is not associated with Notch target induction.  Therefore, Notch and Stat6 signaling may represent two parallel pathways for  inducing mucous metaplasia. Scale bars: 100 μm.</div></div>
