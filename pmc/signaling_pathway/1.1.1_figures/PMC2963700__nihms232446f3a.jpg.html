Western blot analysis of genes associated with calcium signaling pathway in aortic tissues obtained from C57BL/6 and LDb miceSelected proteins associated with calcium signaling pathway were analyzed by Western blot in aortic tissues obtained from C57BL/6 and LDb mice at 2-months and 8-months of ages fed a chow diet. Aortic homogenates (15 μg) were separated by SDS/PAGE. Protein abundances of Gnaq, Calm1, Atp2a2 (SERCA), Ptger3 (EP3), and Mlck (Mylk) were analyzed and quantified using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). Gapdh was used as control to demonstrate equal sample loading to each lane. Each protein was normalized with the corresponding Gapdh value. Statistical analysis was performed as described in the Methods. The symbol of * represents significant difference of p&lt; 0.05. The ratios of LDb/C57BL6 of 2-month and 8-month of each protein are shown.Fig. 3B. Western blot analysis of genes associated with calcium signaling pathway in primary aortic endothelial cells obtained from C57BL/6 and LDb miceAortic endothelial cell protein (15 μg) of LP and LR from C57BL/6 and LDb mice were separated by SDS/PAGE. Protein abundances of Gnaq, Calm1, Atp2a2 (SERCA), Ptger3 (EP3), and Mlck (Mylk) were analyzed and quantified using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR).
