Both sarcopenia and muscular dystrophy exhibit the marked defect of autophagy-dependent signaling possibly the latter due to hyperactivation of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. Lower activation of SRF-dependent signaling has been commonly recognized in these symptoms. Ubiquitin–proteasome system (Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1) would not regulate muscle atrophy in the case of sarcopenia. It remains to be elucidated whether myostatin–Smad pathway regulates to sarcopenic symptom and/or muscular dystrophy.</div></div>
