From: Competition and collaboration: GATA-3, PU.1, and Notch <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in early T-cell fate determination. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic of counterbalancing and dose-dependent regulatory forces that act on T-cell precursors through the ETP and DN2 stages. Regulators named in red denote forces diverting cells from the T-cell pathway. Of these, only EBF and Pax5 are not normally active in the thymus during these stages. Notch signaling acts as a constraint on all of these alternatives. This dynamic equilibrium is normally resolved at the DN3 stage, in part by the downregulation of PU.1, but almost certainly through other regulatory changes as well [163].</div></div>
