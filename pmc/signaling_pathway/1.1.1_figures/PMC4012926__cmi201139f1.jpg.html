AMPK is activated by several hormones, many phytochemicals, certain drugs (for example, metformin) and physical exercise. Obesity and hyperglycemia reduce the expression of AMPK. But Yuk et al.3 showed that LPS, which strongly activates NF-κB via TLR signaling, induced SHP transcription via a CaMKKβ–AMPK–USP1-dependent signaling pathway and that newly produced SHP inhibited NF-κB in a negative feedback loop. MSP mimicked LPS in that it induced the expression of SHP via an LKB1–AMPK–USP1-dependent pathway, attenuating LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Once AMPK has been activated, it stimulates SIRT1, PGC1α, FoxO and p53, which could attenuate NF-κB activation. Liu et al.4 showed that AMPK, via the Nrf2/ARE pathway, induced the HO-1/CO system, which reduced cellular stress and inhibited TLR signaling pathways, resulting in the suppression of NF-κB activation. AMPK can ameliorate inflammatory responses via various direct and indirect anti-inflammatory signaling pathways. ↓, activation; ⊥, inhibition.
