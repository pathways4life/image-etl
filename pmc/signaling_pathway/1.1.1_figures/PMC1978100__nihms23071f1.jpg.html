Protein extracts (40μg) from melanoma cell lines were analyzed by Western blots using the indicated antibodies. Human melanocytes (HuMel) were used as a control. α-Tubulin reveals equal loading. <b>B.</b> Inhibition of B-Raf reduces c-Jun levels. Lu1205 cells were treated with 300nM CHR-265 for 6h and 24h. Protein samples were analyzed by Western blots using the indicated antibodies. α-Tubulin reveals equal loading. <b>C.</b> Inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway reduces c-Jun levels. A375 cells were treated with 50μM PD98059 and 20μM U0126 for 24h. Protein samples were analyzed by Western blots using the indicated antibodies.</div></div>
