Upon binding of IL-1 to IL-1RI, an IL-1RAcP is recruited to form a high affinity IL-1R1-IL-1RAcP heterodimeric receptor, which initiates the downstream signaling cascade. The trimeric complex rapidly assembles MyD88 and IRAK4 and forms a stable IL-1-induced first signaling module, which subsequently phosphorylates IRAK1 and IRAK2, and recruits TRAF6. Complexes of IRAK1, IRAK2 and TRAF6 dissociate from the initial receptor complex and promote TGFβ-activated protein kinase (TAK)1/TAK-binding protein (TAB)1 association, which is followed by the activation of NFκB, JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. Activation of the IKK complex by IL-1 promotes IκBα ubiquitination. The nuclear translocation of NFκB with the nuclear translocation of c-JUN, induced by the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK, modulates the gene expression of IL-6, TNFα, IL-1β, IFNα, IFNβ and TGFβ. Multiple negative regulators of this pathway, including inhibitory IL-RII, secreted soluble (s)IL-1RI and sIL-RII, regulatory IL-1R1a and SIGIRR provide a negative feedback control of this pathway and suppress excessive IL-1 signaling.</div></div>
