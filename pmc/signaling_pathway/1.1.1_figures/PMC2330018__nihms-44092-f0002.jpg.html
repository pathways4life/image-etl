(<b>A</b>) Viability of the retinal cultures was reduced by 50% by 0.1 mM H2O2. Wnt signaling activator SB216763 (40 μM) significantly increased the viability of the retinal cultures, whereas the vehicle control DMSO had no effect. Viability was measured by XTT assay and normalized to the untreated cultures. (<b>B</b>) TUNEL assay confirmed that photoreceptors in the cultures were rescued from H2O2 toxicity. Recombinant Wnt3a ligand (150 ng/mL) was used to activate the Wnt pathway, and rhodopsin+/TUNEL+ cells were counted. (<b>C</b>) Recombinant Wnt3a increased the viability of retinal cultures exposed to H2O2, measured by XTT assay. Two concentrations of Wnt3a were tested. The “no Wnt” cells were treated with H2O2 alone. (<b>D</b>, <b>E</b>) The Wnt signaling pathway was activated in the retinal cultures. Cultures were transfected with the Wnt reporter plasmid and a LacZ plasmid and then were incubated with the Wnt activators SB216763 and Wnt3a. Wnt signaling was measured by the luciferase reporter assay using β-galactosidase activity for normalization (values given in thousands).</div></div>
