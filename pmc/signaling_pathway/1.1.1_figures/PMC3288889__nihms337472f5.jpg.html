A) Upon bind the EphB receptor, ephrin-B may be proteolytically processed by MMPs and presenilin 1/-gamma secretase to release a C-terminal fragment. The free fragment may translocate to the nucleus to perform a yet unknown function, or possibly the fragment binds to the Src kinase and inhibits its association with inhibitory kinase Csk, and allows Src autophosphorylation. Src, in turn, phosphorylates ephrin-B2, which can recruit certain signaling partners, such as Grb4, leading to functional effects. B) Unliganded ephrin-Bs may be cleaved by ADAM13 leading to an increase in canonical Wnt signaling through the cognate EphB receptor. Upon binding to the EphB receptor, ephrin-Bs may be resistant to ADAM13 cleavage, thus activating non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway (not pictured) at the expense of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.</div></div>
