RT-qPCR was performed to estimate the transcription rate of hormone receptor genes and of a few key factors involved in related signaling pathways (<b>a–e</b>, ETH receptor genes, OsERS1, OsERS2, OsETR2, OsETR3, and OsETR4. <b>f</b>, ACC synthetase gene, OsACS1. <b>g</b>, ABA receptor gene, OsPYL. <b>h</b>, CTK receptor gene, OsHk6. <b>I</b>, GA receptor gene, OsGID1. <b>j</b>, a gene for a key transcript factor (DELLA protein OsSLR1) in the GA signaling pathway. <b>k–m</b>, IAA receptor genes, OsAFB and OsTIR. <b>n</b>: SA receptor gene, OsNPR4. Data are presented as mean ± SE, n = 3, *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, ***P&lt;0.001 compared with the control group (t-test).</div></div>
