From: Induction of Distinct TLR2-Mediated Proinflammatory and Proadhesive <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Pathways in Response to Porphyromonas gingivalis Fimbriae . </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The model is based on the current findings and our previously published studies (6, 19–21). P. gingivalis fimbriae interact with the CD14/TLR2 complex leading to TLR2 activation. Activated TLR2 induces TIRAP/MyD88-dependent signaling for NF-κB activation and induction of proinflammatory cytokines (proinflammatory pathway), and TIRAP/MyD88-independent signaling for transactivation of the CR3 adhesive activity (proadhesive pathway). The latter pathway proceeds via Rac1, PI3K and cytohesin-1 (Cyt-1). Cytohesin-1 is likely to function immediately downstream of PI3K, since it was previously shown to use PI3K-generated PIP3 for membrane docking and interaction with the CD18 cytoplasmic tail (48).</div></div>
