A hypothetical signaling network, which transfers information from cytosolic enzymes to transcription factors to regulate gene expression.b. The ordinary differential equation represents the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the Y protein. The partial differential equation models the effects of molecular diffusion and biochemical reactions with spatial dependence.c. Measurements of the signaling network and phenotypic output (possibly measured through flow cytometry) are analyzed together to form a reduced space partial least squares regression model.d. Network-based approaches. Network component analysis determines the linear weight of transcription factors on gene regulation. Extreme pathway analysis gives the minimal set of pathways that characterize the functional signaling in a network.</div></div>
