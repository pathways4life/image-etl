Each node represents a protein; the proteins in shaded nodes in the pathway are identified/relate to an identified protein in the proteomic analysis. While proteins in clear nodes are part of the pathway but have not been identified in the GV oocyte or cumulus datasets. Proteins in red nodes were shown higher expression in cumulus cells compared to GV oocyte.</div></div>
