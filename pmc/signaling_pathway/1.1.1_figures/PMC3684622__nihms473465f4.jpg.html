(D) Effects of miRNA control on the strength and threshold of immune signaling. A1, A2, and An represent positive signaling molecules in the pathway (i.e. the positive kinases). B1, B2, and Bn represent negative signaling molecules in the pathway (i.e. the phosphatases that inactive positive kinases).</div></div>
