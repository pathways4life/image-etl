From: N-Acylethanolamine Metabolism Interacts with Abscisic Acid <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Arabidopsis thaliana Seedlings. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Diagram Showing the Hypothetical Action of Elevated Levels of NAE on Seedling Growth and Its Relationship to ABA Action.NAE arrests seedling growth via a pathway dependent upon ABI1, ABI2, ABI3, and ABI5, and this is associated with upregulation of ABA-responsive genes, such as At HVA22b, CRA1, RAB18, EXGT-A4, ATEM1, and LEAM17. This suppression of seedling growth is reminiscent of the ABA-induced secondary dormancy program discovered by Chua and coworkers (Lopez-Molina et al., 2002), which is operable in young seedlings. We propose that NAE12:0 intersects the ABA signaling pathway downstream from ABA and that ABI3 expression is key to the suppression of growth induced by NAE metabolism. Independent of ABA signaling, NAE12:0 can influence gene expression in seeds and seedlings and suppress seedling growth. Ectopic overexpression of FAAH can reverse the growth suppression by NAE, but the interaction with ABA signaling in FAAH overexpressors is complex since FAAH overexpressors are hypersensitive to ABA. By contrast, the situation with abi mutants is more straightforward because they exhibited partial tolerance to NAE12:0 in addition to their ABA-tolerant phenotypes.</div></div>
