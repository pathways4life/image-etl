Intracellular triglycerides (B) and cholesterol (C) quantification in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes knockdown for LRP1 (black), control (gray), and non-transfected cells (white) induced for adipogenesis during the indicated time with a differentiation mixture containing IGF-1. D, the LRP1/ShcA switches IGF-1 signaling from the Akt/mTOR to the Grb2/Ras/ERK1/2 pathway. LRP1 is required for a full activation of the ShcA/Grb2/Ras/ERK1/2 pathway and progression in the cell cycle in response to IGF-1. When LRP1 is lacking, the Akt/mTOR pathway is activated.
