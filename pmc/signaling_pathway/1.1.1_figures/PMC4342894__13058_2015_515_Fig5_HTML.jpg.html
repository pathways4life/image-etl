(A)</b> Overview of the AKT signaling pathway illustrating the results of our analysis. Genes in yellow rectangles represent the genes targeted by microRNAs (miRs) miR-125b, miR-205, miR-424 and miR-30a. <b>(B)</b> Western blot analysis of the AKT pathway in MCF-7aro and Res-Let cells. <b>(C)</b> Western blot analysis of the AKT pathway in MCF-7aro cells transfected with the mimic of miR-125b-5p or miR-205-5p, the inhibitor of miR-424-3p, or their respective negative controls. <b>(D)</b> Western blot analysis of the AKT pathway activation status in Res-Let cells transfected with the inhibitor of miR-125b-5p or miR-205-5p, the mimic of miR-424-3p, or their respective negative controls. <b>(B)</b>, <b>(C)</b> and <b>(D)</b> show representative blots from three independent experiments and cell lysates. The relative expression levels of the corresponding ratio of phosphorylated to total proteins were quantified, and these data are shown below the blots.</div></div>
