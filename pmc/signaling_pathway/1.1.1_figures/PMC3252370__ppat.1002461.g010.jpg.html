Hypothetical model for the interactions of HIV-1 gp120, FN, α5β1 integrin, Robo4 and Slit2, and their effect on the permeability of lymphatic endothelium..  From: Slit2/Robo4 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Modulates HIV-1 gp120-Induced Lymphatic Hyperpermeability. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Robo4 and α5β1 integrin are expressed on the surface of lymphatic endothelial cells. Under physiologic conditions, endogenous Slit2 interacts with Robo4 via its Ig domains, and inhibits c-Src signaling. FN also interacts with Robo4 (via its FN type III domains), and binds to α5β1 integrin on the endothelial cell surface. This contributes further to the dynamic regulation of Robo4 signaling by Slit2 and FN, to maintain the integrity of the lymphatic endothelial barrier. Upon HIV infection, gp120 significantly elevates FN levels and complexes with FN. FN then activates α5β1 integrin, which results in enhanced intracellular signaling through α5β1 integrin, a stronger interaction between FN and Robo4, and disruption of Robo4 signaling. These changes activate the c-Src signaling pathway and induce hyperpermeability of the lymphatic endothelial barrier. Exogenous Slit2 may protect the lymphatic channels from HIV-induced vasculopathy by interacting with Robo4 to restore Robo4 signaling, block the c-Src pathway, and inhibit HIV-induced lymphatic hyperpermeability.</div></div>
