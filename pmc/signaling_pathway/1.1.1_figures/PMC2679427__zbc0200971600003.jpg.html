Following transactivation of its genes, Nrf2 is targeted for  degradation by Keap1 in the nucleus, a process that requires the transient  shuttling of Keap1 into this compartment. In cells under stress, stabilization  of Nrf2 is thought to be dependent on mechanisms that either prevent or reduce  access of Keap1 to Nrf2. This figure was reproduced from Ref.  12.</div></div>
