Genes listed in red were sequenced only in genomic DNAs from 217 tumors (“Group 1”). Genes listed in blue were sequenced only in WGA-treated DNA tumor samples (“Group 2”). Genes in black were sequenced in both groups. Gene nomenclature is as reported in GenBank as of December 2006. See Supplemental Table S3 for clinical characteristics of all tumors sequenced.</div></div>
