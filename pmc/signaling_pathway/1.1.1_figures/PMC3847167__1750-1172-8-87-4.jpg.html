Binding of wg/WNT1 ligand to a Fz and arr/LRP receptor complex leads to stabilization of hypophosphorylated arm/CTNNB1, translocating it to the nucleus. In the nucleus, arm/CTNNB1 competes with and displaces gro/TLE interacting with pan/TCF proteins to activate transcription. In Drosophila, lines/LINS was found to act as a modulator of wg/WNT canonical pathway acting in parallel with or downstream of arm/CTNNB1 in response to wg/WNT1 signaling to enhance or represses the transcription of target genes. Frizzled (Fz), arrow (arr), LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), armallido (Arm), Î²-catenin (CTNNB1), groucho (gro), transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE), pangolin (pan), T-cell factor (TCF).</div></div>
