From: Convergence of auxin and gibberellin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> on the regulation of the GATA transcription factors GNC and GNL in Arabidopsis thaliana. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of the control mechanisms acting on the transcriptional control of GNC and GNL. GNC and GNL expression is repressed by ARF2 (red) and ARF7 (blue). In addition, the abundance of their transcripts is under the direct repression control of the GA signaling cascade and the PIF repressors as well as indirect GA control by the stabilization of ARF2 (green). Other genes that are under ARF and PIF control may also be regulated in a manner similar to GNC and GNL. In addition, gene expression events that are under control of the auxin pathway may also be regulated by GA signaling because of the control of ARF2 abundance by GA. The individual pathways are shown in distinct colors.</div></div>
