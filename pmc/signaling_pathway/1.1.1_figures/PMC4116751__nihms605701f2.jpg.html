Possible genetic interactions that can enhance the phenotype of a hypormorphic allele.  From: Dissection of Genetic Pathways in C. elegans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A hypomorphic mutation (X) causes partial loss of gene function, which only slightly reduces the activity of a corresponding signaling pathway. This reduction can be dramatically enhanced by loss or reduction in the activity of a gene (Y) that encodes a physical interacting partner (i), acts upstream (ii), downstream (iii) of the same pathway, or functions in a parallel pathway that functionally compensate for each other (iv).</div></div>
