The ICN then translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to CSL transcription repressor and converts it to activator by recruiting MAML (mastermind-like protein) to the complex including p300 and co-activator. Notch signaling is also regulated by other cellular proteins including Deltex, Nrarp (Notch-regulated ankyrin-repeat protein) and MINT (Msx2-interacting nuclear target protein).</div></div>
