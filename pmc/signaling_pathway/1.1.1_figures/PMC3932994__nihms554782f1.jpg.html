Crosstalk between the <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways that mediate nutrient sensing and the mating response.  From: <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Crosstalk: Integrating Nutrient Availability and Sex. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The mating response pathway is initiated when the pheromone α factor binds to the GPCR Ste2 at the plasma membrane. Ligand binding stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP by Gpa1 and the dissociation of Gpa1 from the Ste4-Ste18 dimer of the G protein. Ste4-Ste18 interacts with Ste20 to stimulate the MAPK signaling cascade, culminating in the activation of Fus3 and the mating response. During conditions of glucose abundance, the Ras and Gpa2 pathways activate PKA, which promotes the Glc7-Reg1–dependent dephosphorylation of Gpa1 to maintain an efficient mating response. However, when glucose concentrations are limiting, PKA and the Glc7-Reg1 phosphatase complex are inactivated. Thus, the kinase Sak1 phosphorylates both Snf1 (the AMPK homolog), to initiate metabolic adaptation, and the Gpa1 protein, to reduce mating efficiency. The exact consequences of Gpa1 phosphorylation on G protein signaling remain to be determined.</div></div>
