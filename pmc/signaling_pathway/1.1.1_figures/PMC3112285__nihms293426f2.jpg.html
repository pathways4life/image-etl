From: The Ras-ERK and PI3K-mTOR Pathways: Cross-talk and Compensation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Pathway Crosstalk. The Ras-MAPK and PI3K-mTORC1 pathways regulate each other via cross-inhibition (red) and cross-activation (green). Each pathway has a mechanism to negatively feed onto the other: ERK phosphorylation of GAB and AKT phosphorylation of Raf. Components of the Ras-ERK pathway (Ras, Raf, ERK, and RSK) also positively regulate the PI3K-mTORC1 pathway. TSC2 and mTORC1 are key integration points that receive many inputs from both the Ras-ERK and PI3K signaling. Positive regulation of the substrate protein is shown as an arrow. Negative regulation of the substrate protein is depicted as a blunt-ended line.</div></div>
