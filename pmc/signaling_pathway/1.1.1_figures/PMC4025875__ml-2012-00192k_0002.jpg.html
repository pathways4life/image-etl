The relative expression of GLI1 and PTCH was determined in M2-10B4 cells following treatment with the standard Hh activating OHCs (<b>1</b>:<b>2</b>) or <b>35</b> and the Hh-specific inhibitor Cyc. Cells were pretreated with Cyc (5 μM) for 2 h and then treated with OHC (5 μM). mRNA expression was determined following 24 h of incubation. Data are from a representative experiment performed in triplicate.</div></div>
