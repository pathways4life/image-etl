From: Rosuvastatin suppresses platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration via the MAPK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Rosuvastatin inhibited the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway activated by platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Con, VSMCs were cultured without any treatment; NC, VSMCs were treated only with PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for 48 h; rosuvastatin, VSMCs were treated with rosuvastatin (10 Î¼M) and PDGF-BB (20 ng/ml) for 48 h. Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), ERK, phospho-p38, p38, phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and JNK. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal reference.</div></div>
