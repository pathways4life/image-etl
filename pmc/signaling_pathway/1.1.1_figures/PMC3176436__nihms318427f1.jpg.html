Strains expressing GFP-tagged versions of Dcp2, Dhh1, Pat1 and Xrn1 were transformed with either a vector control or a MET3-RAS2val19 plasmid. Cells were grown to mid-log phase in SC-glucose medium and expression from the RAS2val19 locus was induced by transferring cells to a medium lacking methionine for 2 hr. The cells were then starved for glucose for 15 min and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.(B) The formation of P-bodies in early stationary phase was inhibited by elevated Ras/PKA signaling. Wild-type yeast with either a control vector or a MET3-RAS2val19 plasmid were grown for 24 hr in an SC-glucose medium lacking methionine.(C, D) The down-regulation of PKA activity was sufficient to induce P-body formation in glucose-replete conditions. In C, cells containing an analog-sensitive allele of TPK1, tpk1-as, were treated with 5 Î¼M 1NM-PP1 for 15 min. In D, the cells were transformed with either a control vector or a high-copy PDE2 plasmid.</div></div>
