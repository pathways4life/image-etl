(A) Expression of BDNF, p-PI3K/t-PI3K, p-Akt/t-Akt and in the cortex were analyzed by Western blot. BDNF, PI3K/Akt and HSP70 differed significantly between non-Tg and Tg mice in the cortex (B-E). Treadmill exercised mice showed a significant increase in levels of cortex BDNF (B), p-PI3K/t-PI3K ratio (C), p-Akt/t-Akt ratio (E) and HSP70 proteins (D) compared to control mice. ap &lt; .05, dp &lt; .001 vs. non-Tg-control; bp &lt; .05, ep &lt; .001 vs. non-Tg-exercise; cp &lt; .05, fp &lt; .001 vs. Tg-control mice.
