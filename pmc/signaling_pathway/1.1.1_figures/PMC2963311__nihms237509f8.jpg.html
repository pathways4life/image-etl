From: FMRFamide neuropeptides and acetylcholine synergistically inhibit egg-laying by C. elegans. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">EGL-6 signaling inhibits egg-laying behavior redundantly with acetylcholine. (<b>a</b>) Loss of function in both EGL-6 signaling and acetylcholine signaling decreases egg retention time. The distribution of developmental stages of embryos laid by unc-17 mutants (defective in vesicular acetylcholine transport) is shown together with the distributions of stages of eggs laid by worms mutant for unc-17 and genes in the egl-6 pathway or unc-17 mutants lacking BAG neurons. BAG neurons were ablated with a laser microbeam in unc-17 mutants. An asterisk denotes the presence of the gcy-33âˆ·gfp transgene nIs242, used in some strains to facilitate identification of BAG neurons. The unc-17 allele used was e113. The egl-6, flp-10, and flp-17 alleles used were n4536, n4543 and n4894, respectively. (<b>b</b>) Loss of function in the egl-6 pathway suppresses the egg-laying defect of mutants with excess acetylcholine signaling. Shown are distributions of developmental stages of eggs laid by ace-2; ace-1 double mutants (defective in acetylcholinesterase function) and by worms multiply mutant for acetylcholinesterase-encoding genes and genes in the egl-6 pathway. The ace-1 allele used was p1000. The ace-2 allele used was g72. The egl-6, flp-10, and flp-17 alleles used were n4536, n4543 and n4894, respectively.</div></div>
