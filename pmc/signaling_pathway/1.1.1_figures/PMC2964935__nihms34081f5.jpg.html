The components of this scheme are drawn from different model systems, and it is unlikely that the details are common to all organisms or polarization processes. It is therefore somewhat speculative, but does indicate a possible mechanism by which cytoskeletal organization could trigger localized changes in phosphoinositide metabolism, which in turn localizes PAR-6/aPKC through CDC43-GTP.</div></div>
