However, both pathways stimulate IKK and degradation of an NFκB-IκB-PKAc complex, setting free active PKAc that phosphorylates VASP and other substrates involved in platelet inhibitory pathways. Note that in order to simplify the illustration, it was necessary to limit it to the few pathways shown that were the focus of this study. Dotted lines indicate that intermediary agents which transmit thrombin/collagen effects on NFκB-IκB-PKA signaling require further elucidation.</div></div>
