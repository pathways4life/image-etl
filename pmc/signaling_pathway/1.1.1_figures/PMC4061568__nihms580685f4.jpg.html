A. H23 cells were transfected with β-catenin and empty vectors, respectively, to detect relative luciferase activities. B. The architecture of SOX17 with an HMG box is depicted in schematic form. Different deletion mutants (SOX17 constructs 50–414, 135–414, and 1–353) were generated by PCR. C. H23 cells were co-transfected with β-catenin and different SOX17 expression vectors (wild-type or mutant). Transfection with wild-type and mutant SOX17 showed greater or less suppressive effects on β-catenin/TCF-LEF transcriptional activity. D. Transfection with wild-type SOX17 inhibited cyclin D1, a downstream gene of the Wnt signaling pathway.</div></div>
