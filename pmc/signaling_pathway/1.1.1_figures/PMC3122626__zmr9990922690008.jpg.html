The cAMP-PKA signaling cascade and MAPK cascade represent two key morphogenetic signaling pathways conserved in these species. The MAPK signaling cascades modulating morphogenesis in A. fumigatus (the HOG-MAPK pathway and cell wall integrity MAPK pathway) are distinct from the MAPK module depicted in this figure. (Top) The cAMP-PKA pathway. (Bottom) The MAPK cascade. Corresponding colors between pathways indicate orthologous proteins between the species. Gray arrows indicate that links between certain factors in this pathway have not yet been established.</div></div>
