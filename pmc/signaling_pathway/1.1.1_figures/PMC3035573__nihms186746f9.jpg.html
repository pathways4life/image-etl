Model of thrombin-induced platelet activation through PAR1 and PAR4.  From: PAR4, but Not PAR1, Signals Human Platelet Aggregation via Ca2+ Mobilization and Synergistic P2Y12 Receptor Activation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Thrombin activates both PAR1 and PAR4 following vascular injury. PAR1 activates Gαi/o, Gαq, and Gα12/13, whereas PAR4 activates Gαq and Gα12/13. All three of these G proteins play a role in platelet aggregation. Additionally, through secretion of the dense granules, ADP is released and acts as an autocrine signal on the P2Y12 receptor. PAR4 signaling calcium mobilization downstream of phospholipase Cβ through the Gαq pathway converges with signaling through the P2Y12 pathway to induce platelet aggregation. Finally, Rap1 activation is partially dependent on P2Y12 signaling but may also be activated directly through PAR1 or PAR4 most likely through signaling in the Gαq or Gα12/13 pathway.</div></div>
