The significantly populated pathways for tgHD rats were rationally clustered into subgroups focused upon energy metabolism (A), cell communication (B), and neuronal function (C). For each significantly-populated KEGG pathway a ‘hybrid’ score was generated which represents the −log10 of the enrichment probability multiplied with the relative enrichment factor compared to the background proteomic expression.</div></div>
