From: Differentially Expressed miRNAs after GnRH Treatment and Their Potential Roles in FSH Regulation in Porcine Anterior Pituitary Cell. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">This figure was drawn according to KEGG pathway (ssc4912), red arrow near the box (general on the right) represents up-regulated miRNAs while blue arrow represents down-regulated miRNAs. The number near the arrow indicates number of miRNAs targeting this gene or its family. For example, 10 up-regulated miRNAs and 3 down-regulated miRNAs were predicted to target FSHβ mRNA 3′-UTR.TF indicates transcription factor involved in FSHβ transcription.</div></div>
