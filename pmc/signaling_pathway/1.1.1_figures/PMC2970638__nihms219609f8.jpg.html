Dystroglycan-related defects in the muscular dystrophies leads to upregulation of integrins and associated proteins. Upregulation of FA proteins such as paxillin, vinculin and FAK helps to preserve muscle integrity by maintaining a balance between adhesion and contractility. A role for MAPK proteins in sustained stretch-mediated mechanosignaling emerges as a common pathway in both dystrophies studied.</div></div>
