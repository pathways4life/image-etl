Three cytokines were considered: TGFβ, Wnt and BMP2. Intracellular signaling pathway consists of Smad2/3, Smad 1/5, βCatenin, and Runx2 and Osx. Runx2 can promote the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into pre-osteoblasts (OBp) and can inhibit the differentiation of pre-osteoblasts into active osteoblasts (OBa). Osx also play a promoting role in the later stage of osteoblastic lineage which interacts with osteoclastic lineage through intercellular signaling pathway RANK-RANKL OPG.</div></div>
