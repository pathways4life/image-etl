Those with 1.3 fold up- or down-regulated genes in our data were uploaded and displayed into this pathway. Red color indicates up-regulation of gene expression and green down-regulated genes while white indicate no change of gene expression. The detailed fold changes and full name of each gene or isoform were presented in Table S4.</div></div>
