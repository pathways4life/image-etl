From: Rosiglitazone sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines to 5-fluorouracil antitumor activity through activation of the PPAR? <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The effect of rosiglitazone on PTEN and COX-2 protein expression. Cellular protein was isolated from BEL-7402 cells (A) or Huh 7 cells (C) that were cultured with rosiglitazone (30 μmol/L) in the presence or absence of 5-FU (10 μmol/L) for 24 h. Then, western blotting analysis was used to detect the PTEN and COX-2 protein expression. (B) The PPARγ signaling pathway was inactivated by PPARγ siRNA method in BEL-7402 cells (B) or Huh 7 cells (D). Western blotting analysis was used to detect the PTEN and COX-2 protein expression of BEL-7402 cells treated with rosiglitazone (30 μmol/L) with or without 5-FU (10 μmol/L) for 24 h. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Con, cells treated with 0.1% DMSO; Con siRNA, non-specific siRNA, as a negative control.</div></div>
