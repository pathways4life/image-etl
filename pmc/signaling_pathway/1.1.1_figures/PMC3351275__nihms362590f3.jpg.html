Reciprocal feedback regulation of PI3K/AKT and AR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>.  From: Negative feedback and adaptive resistance to the targeted therapy of cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">On the left panel is a model depicting crosstalk between the PI3K/AKT pathway and the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway with each pathway negatively regulating the other. In the middle panel is the consequence of inhibiting AR signaling with downregulation of AR causing lower levels of FKBP5 and thus impairing the function of the AKT phosphatase PHLPP. The result is that AR inhibition causes an upregulation in AKT activity. In the right panel is the consequence of inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling with downregulation of AKT causing an induction of RTKs such as HER3 and this causing an induction of AR signaling.</div></div>
