A simple model of the Fgf and Wnt gene network in the zebrafish tailbud.  From: Crosstalk between Fgf and Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in the zebrafish tailbud. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In addition to the previously described autoregulatory loops between Fgf, Wnt and T-box genes (grey arrows), we find evidence of more direct intertwining of the Fgf and Wnt pathways (colored arrows). Fgf signaling inhibits transcription of the Wnt inhibitors dkk1 and notum1a. PI3k signaling activates the Wnt pathway by phosphorylating (inactivating) Gsk3β. Phosphorylation of Gsk3β also leads to an increase in active Erk levels, suggesting Wnt signaling promotes Mapk activity. Fgf and Wnt have opposing effects on transcription of co-regulated genes, which include Fgf (spred3) and Wnt (dkk1, notum1a) inhibitors.</div></div>
