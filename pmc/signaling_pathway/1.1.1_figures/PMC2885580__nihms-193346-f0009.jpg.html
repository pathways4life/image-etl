Two parallel calcium-dependent pathways involving calcium-calmodulin kinase (CaMK) and calcineurin (Cn) can regulate MEF2 whereas Cn is the primary pathway that regulates NFATc. Since both NFATc and MEF2 activities are attenuated during chronic diabetes mellitus as well as in both CnAα and CnAβ knockout mice, we propose that reduced Cn signaling is predominantly responsible for the decreased level of PGC-1α expression. Consequently, mitochondrial biogenesis, and the expression of proteins associated with oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle are likely to be affected. Suppression of Cn/NFATc/MEF2 signaling, and subsequent downregulation of PGC-1α may perpetuate the decrease in muscle functional capacity and mass that accompanies diabetes mellitus.</div></div>
