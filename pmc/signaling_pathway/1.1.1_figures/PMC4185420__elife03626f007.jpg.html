From: Pvr expression regulators in equilibrium signal control and maintenance of Drosophila blood progenitors. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Bip1, RpS8, and Nup98 are independently required for the expression of Pvr (direct arrows). Rescue of endogenous Pvr expression by misexpression of bip1 in the Nup98 RNAi background indicates that bip1 functions genetically downstream of Nup98 (dashed arrow) in the control of Pvr expression. Bip1 and RpS8 may work together in a complex (dashed line) to control Pvr expression in vivo. These components collectively comprise the known equilibrium signaling pathway working within the lymph gland to promote progenitor cell maintenance, along with the previously known Hh niche signaling mechanism.<b>DOI:</b> http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03626.017</div></div>
