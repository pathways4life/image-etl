(A) Cells were incubated with various cadmium concentrations (0–10 μM) for 24 h. (B) Cells were also exposed various times (0–24 h) at 10 μM cadmium. The proteins levels were analyzed by Western blot. The phosphorylated mTOR and total mTOR levels were analyzed after transfection with siRNA specific for LKB1(C) or AMPKα (D) to the cells. β-actin was used as loading control.</div></div>
