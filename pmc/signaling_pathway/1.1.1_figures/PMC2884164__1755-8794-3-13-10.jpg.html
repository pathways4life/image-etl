Significant signaling pathway networks that are involved in human pituitary adenoma nitroproteomic data. (A) Network 10 is derived from adenoma nitroproteomic data and function in cancer, cell cycle, reproductive-system disease. A gray node denotes an identified nitroprotein or protein that interact with nitroproteins in our study [4]. (B) Network 11 is derived from control nitroproteomic data and function in gene expression, cellular development, connective tissue development and function. A gray node denotes an identified nitroprotein in our studies [5,6]. An orange solid edge denotes a direct relationship between two nodes (molecules: proteins; genes). An orange unsolid edge denotes an indirect relationship between two nodes (molecules: proteins; genes). The various shapes of nodes denote the different functions (Additional file 1, Tables S3 and S4). A curved line means intracellular translocation; a curved arrow means extracellular translocation.</div></div>
