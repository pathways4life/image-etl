Shown are the key therapeutic targets regulating melanoma development. Whereas PI3K/Akt3 pathway involved in cell survival and apoptosis regulation, MAPK pathway is implicated in cell proliferation. Targeting members of these signaling cascades using pharmacological agents has been shown to inhibit melanoma tumor development. Pharmacological agents inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling; perifosine, 17-AAG, CCI-779 and RAD-001 have been evaluated in clinical trials. Vemurafenib and sorafenib targeting MAPK are also being evaluated in various clinical trials for inhibiting melanomas.</div></div>
