From: Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Network in Skeletal Myogenesis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Two rapamycin-sensitive myogenic mTOR signaling pathways.</b> A kinase-independent mTOR pathway controls IGF2 expression through transcriptional regulation at a muscle-specific enhancer, as well as through suppression of miR-125b, which targets Igf2. IGF2 regulates myogenesis by activating the IGF1 receptor (IGF-IR) and PI3K/Akt signaling. A kinase-dependent mTOR pathway regulates myocyte fusion and myotube/myofiber maturation by controlling follistatin expression via a MyoD/miR-1/HDAC4 pathway. Amino acid signals are most likely upstream of the IGF2 pathway, but their role in the follistatin pathway is not clear.</div></div>
