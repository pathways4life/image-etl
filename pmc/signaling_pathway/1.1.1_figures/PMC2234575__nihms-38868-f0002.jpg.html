Common Mechanisms Promoting PAH May Rely upon the Intersecting BMPR-II and Serotoninergic Pathways.  From: Pathogenic Mechanisms of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In the serotoninergic pathway, both genetic predisposition (i.e., platelet storage pool disease, perhaps 5-HT2B mutations, or perhaps the L-allele variant of 5-HTT) and specific exogenous stimuli (i.e., hypoxia, anorexigens) lead to vessel remodeling via increased serotonin levels, increased 5-HTT activity, and/or increased serotonin receptor signaling. In the BMPR-II pathway, genetic predisposition (such as heterozygous loss-of-function +/âˆ’ BMPR2 mutations) and, perhaps, exogenous stimuli lead to decreased receptor expression, alteration of downstream signaling, and resulting vessel remodeling. Additional pathogenic mechanisms may upregulate the angiopoietin-1/Tie2 receptor pathway with resulting repression of BMPR-1A function and alteration of BMPR-II signaling. Interestingly, serotonin can directly upregulate angiopoietin-1 and can modulate downstream Smad function, thereby influencing the BMP signaling cascade. This functional intersection has yet to be fully described, but may represent a common, unifying mechanism of pathogenesis.</div></div>
