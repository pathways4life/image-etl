(A) In [garâˆ’] glucose-grown cells, Pma1 associates with Mth1. The glucose signal is propagated through Snf3 and Rgt2 to Yck1 and Yck2, which phosphorylate Mth1 and Std1. This phosphorylation marks Mth1 and Std1 for degredation, leaving their interacting partner, Rgt1, free in the cytosol, where it does not repress transcription at the HXT3 locus. (B) Under [GAR+] conditions, HXT3 transcription is repressed, which resembles that of cells grown in a carbon source other than glucose. Pma1 associates with Std1, which somehow facilitates the repression of HXT3, possibly by altering the affinity of Std1 for Rgt1. Association with Std1 has been shown previously to facilitate the binding of Rgt1 to DNA (Lakshmanan et al. 2003). The association between Pma1 can either be transient or stable, but either way it aids in the establishment of an altered signaling pathway. This altered pathway is then maintained either by the contained association between Std1 and Pma1 or by a feedback loop within the signaling cascade itself.</div></div>
