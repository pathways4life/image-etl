In this signaling, AR downregulation is required to control NSE, NEP, p16INK4A and p21WAF expression (i). However, Rb phosphorylation and expression of E2F1 can be downregulated independently of AR downregulation (ii). Decreased AR transcriptional activity leads to PSA downregulation (i) but PSA is also downregulated via a non-transcriptional mechanism independently of AR downregulation (ii). Raf/EMK/ERK-mediated AR downregulation is also detected in a subset of PCa cells regardless of hormone sensitivity.</div></div>
