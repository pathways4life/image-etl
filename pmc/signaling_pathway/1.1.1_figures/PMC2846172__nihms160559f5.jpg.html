The RAS–ERK1/ERK2 pathway is an example of a signaling module that is responsive to microenvironmental cues and requires specific subcellular localization to determine the consequences of gene expression and tumor phenotype. A simplified version of this complex process is illustrated in the diagram. ECM components interact with integrin receptors at the cell surface (step 1) and the affinity of this interaction is modified by growth-factor-regulated signaling, in a process known as ‘inside-out signaling’ (steps 1–3). Conversely, the affinity of the integrin–ECM interaction affects growth-factor-regulated signaling, in a process known as ‘outside-in signaling’ (steps 2–3). The collective interactions between integrins and growth factor receptors promote the localization and activation of lipid-modified RAS (step 2) at the inner cell membrane leaflet (step 4). Activated RAS then selectively activates kinases, such as ERK1/ERK2 and other pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT pathway. RAS also blocks the tumor-suppressing activity of TGF-β1 by linking this pathway to ERK1/ERK2 signaling pathways (step 5). This linkage promotes the proinvasion properties of TGF-β1. Activated ERK1/ERK2 must translocate to the nucleus or cell-adhesion sites (known as ‘focal contacts’) to have access to target proteins that regulate EMT, motility and/or invasion. ERK1-regulated and ERK2-regulated gene expression (e.g. MMP9) further modifies the microenvironment of the tumor cell, thereby affecting the activation status of the integrin–growth factor receptor signaling pathway. This downstream consequence of RAS–ERK1–ERK2 activation and the reversal of steps 1–5 have profound effects on the phenotype even if other pathways are mutated.
