From: NF-?B in Aging and Disease. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The IKK complex (NEMO, IKK1 (IKKα), and IKK2 (IKKβ)) can be activated by numerous stimuli and via shared signaling components. Extracellular receptors bind to their ligands and signal via TRAF/RIP/NIK molecules leading to phosphorylation of IKK subunits, which subsequently phosphorylate IκBα and lead to its ubiquitination and proteosomal degredation. This then releases NF-κB into the nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor. In addition, ATM responds to DNA damage and can also activate the IKK complex.
