From: Epidermal growth factor receptor expression and <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> are essential in glutamine's cytoprotective mechanism in heat-stressed intestinal epithelial-6 cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed working model. GLN is protective in the intestine by preventing EGFR degradation after HS injury, as well as by activating the protective EGFR signaling pathway. GLN phosphorylates ERK1/2 and inactivates p38MAPK via EGFR tyrosine kinase signaling to prevent apoptosis. However, GLN is protective by activating the PI3-K pathway independently from EGFR signaling.</div></div>
