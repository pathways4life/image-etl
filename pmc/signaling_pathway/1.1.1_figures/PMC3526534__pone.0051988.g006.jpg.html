The cellular processes analysis Figure 6E. The Organismal systems analysis.  The up regulated genes showed value over zero, while the down regulated genes showed value range from 0 to âˆ’2. Results showed that the most up regulated genes belongs to the following pathways: cellular process pathways, such as cell cycle and apoptosis; environmental information processing pathways, such as MAPK signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway; genetic information processing pathways such as ribosom; global pathways such as microbial metabolism in diverse environment; organismal systems pathways, such as T cell receptor signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation molecules, while the most down regulated genes belongs to the following pathways: cellular process pathways, such as phagosome, endocytosis and autophagy; environmental information processing pathways, such as calcium signaling pathway; global pathway such as metabolic pathways; organismal systems pathways, such as Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway (as shown in Figure 6, Table S3, and Table S5). Results suggested that if we want to improve present tuberculosis therapy, we may pay more attention to the function of these DGEs to effectively control Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.</div></div>
