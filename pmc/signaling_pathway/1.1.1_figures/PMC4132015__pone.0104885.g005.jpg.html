Sequences mainly from D. melanogaster were compared to the final P. tepidariorum assembly by BLAST. In cases where no D. melanogaster ortholog was present (grey boxes with grey or white typeface) the respective mouse or human sequence was used as query (see Table S3 for details). Genes identified in the spider transcriptome are marked in blue. Pathway schematics modified from KEGG pathway model images http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg1.html. A Notch pathway; B TGFÎ² pathway; C Wnt pathway; D Hedgehog pathway; E Janus Kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway; F Mitogen-activated protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway.</div></div>
