JNK phosphorylation was used to test the activation of JNK signaling; pJNK is increased in usp5 mutant clones. B′ puc transcription level is labeled using the puc-lacZ reporter (β-GAL labeling); puc level is increased in the dorsal eye imaginal disc where USP5 is knocked-down as driven by mirr-Gal4.</div></div>
