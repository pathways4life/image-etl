Models of <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> outputs generated by dual kinase activity of the Baboon receptor..  From: R-Smad Competition Controls Activin Receptor Output in Drosophila. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Given the potential of Baboon to phosphorylate and activate dSmad2 and Mad, we present several configurations of Baboon, dSmad2 and Mad interaction that would generate different signaling outputs. In each schematic, only the most relevant pathway components are drawn. The first model represents a logic gate, where the ability of Baboon to phosphorylate Mad is strictly controlled by the expression of dSmad2 in that cell (A). Another model incorporates the observed degradation of dSmad2 in response to Baboon signaling (B). The final model (C) incorporates feed-back or feed-forward of Mad activity through dSmad2 regulation. If P-Mad positively regulated dSmad2 this would prevent the complete loss of dSmad2. Conversely, if P-Mad negatively regulated dSmad2 expression, this would enforce the switch from Baboon signaling through dSmad2 towards Mad.</div></div>
