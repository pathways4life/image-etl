Induced Jak/Stat and PI3K/S6 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> varies among AML samples..  From: Distinct Patterns of DNA Damage Response and Apoptosis Correlate with Jak/Stat and PI3Kinase Response Profiles in Human Acute Myelogenous Leukemia. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Pathway activity is represented by heat-maps. Blue: Low Signaling, Red: High Signaling, scaled for an individual readout/metric. (A) Jak/Stat pathway activity was measured after treatment of AML samples with IL-27, IL-6, and G-CSF. Heat map of Jak/Stat signaling responses, where each row represents a specific readout and metric such as: p-Stat1 | Basal, IL-27 → p-Stat1 | Total. The samples have been ordered according to IL-27 → p-Stat3 | Total, since this node had the highest AUC and p-value for stratifying CRs from NRs [28]. Cytogenetic risk and FAB categories are noted for each sample. (B) Exemplary 2D flow plots showing signaling responses to G-CSF or IL-27 treatment. (C) PI3K pathway activity was measured after treatment of AML samples with FLT3L, SCF and SDF-1α. Heat map of PI3K signaling responses, where each row represents a specific readout and metric. Patient samples have been ordered according to FLT3L → p-Akt | Fold responses. (D) Exemplary 2D Flow plots showing signaling responses to FLT3L or SCF treatment.</div></div>
