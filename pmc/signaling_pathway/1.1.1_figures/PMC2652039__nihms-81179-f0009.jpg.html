Proposed <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> involving TAK1 and Akt in TWEAK-induced activation of NF-κB.  From: Tumor Necrosis Factor-like Weak Inducer of Apoptosis (TWEAK) activates proinflammatory <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways and gene expression through the activation of TGF-beta activated kinase 1. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Binding of TWEAK to Fn14 receptors leads to the activation of TAK1 and Akt through recruitment of TRAF-1, 2, 3, and/or 5 proteins. Activated TAK1 and Akt then phosphorylate and activate IKKβ in IKK complex leading to the activation NF-κB through canonical pathway. Activated TAK1 can also activate JNK1 and p38 MAPK which in their turn activates AP-1. Increased activation of NF-κB and AP-1 leads to the increased expression of proinflammatory genes.</div></div>
