The most apparent identification of a (de)activated pathway is when the pathway is classified as an outlier in at least three of the four analyses (upper panel). A pathway that was not classified as an outlier could still be identified as significantly (de)activated by a more sensitive method, i.e. if it was ranked as top 3 according to ΔS in at least three of the four analyses (lower panel). The most significant (de)activated pathways are found in both upper and lower panels. The requirements for a significant (de)activated pathway were fulfilled for the JNK pathway (p = 2·10−6), the Fas pathway (p = 3·10−5), and the p38 pathway (p = 0.001) when comparing high LET-irradiated versus control cells (A) and for the JNK pathway (p = 6·10−6) and the Fas pathway (p = 3·10−5) when comparing high LET- versus low LET-irradiated cells (C). When comparing low LET-irradiated versus control cells no significantly (de)activated pathways were identified (B).
