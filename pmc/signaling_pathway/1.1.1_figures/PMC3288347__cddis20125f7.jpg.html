From: JNK modulates FOXO3a for the expression of the mitochondrial death and mitophagy marker BNIP3 in pathological hypertrophy and in heart failure. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Chronic JNK signaling dominates over AKT signaling and overrides the inhibitory effect of AKT on FOXO3a for the transcription of its effectors, BNIP3 and MurF-1 in POH and in heart failure. JNK and AKT signaling are activated in response to pressure overload. However, despite the increase in AKT activity, BNIP3 expression increased significantly in POH and peaked in HF. On the other hand, the decrease in JNK activity by Ad-DN-JNK and 3 MA in vivo decreased AKT activity and decreased the expression of FOXO3a effectors, BNIP3 and MurF-1. In other words, the expression of FOXO3a effectors, BNIP3 and MurF-1, are directly related to JNK activity and that the chronic activation of JNK dominates over AKT signaling for the activation of FOXO3a and for the transcription of its effectors, BNIP3 and MurF-1. Moreover, the increase in JNK activity phosphorylates Bcl-2 and increases Bax to Bcl-2 ratio, further promoting mitochondria-induced apoptosis.
