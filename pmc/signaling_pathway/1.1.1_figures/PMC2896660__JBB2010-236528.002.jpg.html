Example transcriptional expression data were uploaded to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis application (http://www.ingenuity.com/), and its knowledgebase was used to construct signaling networks on the basis of known interactions from the literature. These approaches can allow the visualization of networks associated with viral infection and identify signaling “hubs” which may act as master switches of the host response.</div></div>
