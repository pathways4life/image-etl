Schematic model depicting the role of Tmem64-mediated Ca2+ oscillation in production of mitochondrial ROS during OC differentiation.  From: Tmem64 modulates calcium <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> during RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Shown are mechanisms that involve the RANKL-stimulated Ca2+ signal pathway. Association between Tmem64 and SERCA2 in the ER leads to cytosolic Ca2+ spiking for activation of NFATc1 and production of mitochondrial ROS, thereby triggering a Ca2+ signaling cascades that promote osteoclast differentiation and activation.</div></div>
