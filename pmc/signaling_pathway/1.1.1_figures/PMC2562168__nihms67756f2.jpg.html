Crosstalk between the mating and the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway. Although these pathways are normally separate, high osmolarity stimuli will trigger activation of the mating pathway when HOG pathway output is disrupted (e.g., in hog1Δ cells). Pathway components necessary for this phenomenon are shown in red.B. Crosstalk signaling is switch-like. PFUS1-GFP expression was analyzed in hog1Δ ste5Δ cells (PPY1372) treated with 0–1 M sorbitol.C. Stimulus identity influences signaling behavior. Top: PFUS1-GFP FACS profiles of hog1Δ STE5 cells (PPY1825) treated with α factor or sorbitol. Bottom: responses in the same strains were averaged over the entire cell population, using a FUS1-lacZ reporter gene and β-galactosidase assays (mean ± SD; n=3).</div></div>
