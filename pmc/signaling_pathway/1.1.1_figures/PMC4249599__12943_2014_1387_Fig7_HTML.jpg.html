A)</b> Effects of RAD001 on phosphorylation of c-MET and its downstream effectors in Asra-EPS and VAESBJ cells. Cells were treated with 1 nM RAD001 for 5â€“360 minutes. <b>B)</b> Effects of RAD001 on phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in Asra-EPS and VAESBJ cells transfected with anti-c-MET siRNAs or a control siRNA. Cells transfected with siRNAs were treated with 1 nM RAD001 for 1 hour.</div></div>
