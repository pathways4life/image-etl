Data are means +/âˆ’ SEM and are from 4 independent experiments. <b>B</b>) Incubation with FAK inhibitor reduced JNK activation as shown by reduced JNK phosphorylation in western blots, which are representative of 4 independent observations. Antibodies against total JNK were used as internal controls.</div></div>
