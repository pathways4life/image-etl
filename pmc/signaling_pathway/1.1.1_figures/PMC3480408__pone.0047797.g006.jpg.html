A schematic model for the roles of CKs in low K signal <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>..  From: Regulatory Roles of Cytokinins and Cytokinin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> in Response to Potassium Deficiency in Arabidopsis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Low K conditions lead to reduced levels of endogenous CKs, which are negative regulators under these conditions. Lower CK levels result in ROS production, HAK5 expression, and then altered root growth. Previous studies showed that ethylene is a positive regulator in low K signaling that controls ROS production, HAK5 expression as well as root hair growth [13]. ABA [30] and auxin [12] also are involved in controlling low K signaling pathway. Arrowhead line, positive regulation; bar-head lines, negative regulation; gray color, previously identified; black color, identified in this study.</div></div>
