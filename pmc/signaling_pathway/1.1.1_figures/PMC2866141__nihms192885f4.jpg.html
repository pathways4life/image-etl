Schematic of proposed mechanism by which GM-CSF regulates LPS responses in macrophages.  From: The Molecular Basis of Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">GM-CSF initially binds to the low-affinity GM-CSF receptor α chain (α), followed by association with the affinity-enhancing β chain (β) and constitutively associated Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) resulting in assembly of a dodecameric structure signaling complex.At low concentrations of GM-CSF (&lt;300 pg/ml), as are normally present in normal healthy tissues, signaling occurs through Ser585 of the β chain and results in myeloid cell survival and GM-CSF stimulated expression of some GM-CSF-dependent TLR-4 signaling pathway components, CD14, RP105, and IRAK-M (dotted lines); other components are not affected by GM-CSF. Both GM-CSF-dependent and GM-CSF-independent components are required for normal responses to LPS. At high concentrations of GM-CSF (&gt;300 pg/ml), signaling via Ser585 is extinguished and signaling occurs exclusively via residue Tyr577, activating STAT5 signaling, which enhances NFκB activity and the LPS response.
