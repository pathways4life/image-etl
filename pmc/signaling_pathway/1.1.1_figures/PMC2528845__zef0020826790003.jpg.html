The stimulation of FGFR by FGF ligands results in the activation of specific downstream target genes. Among the targets of the FGF signaling pathway are several feedback inhibitors, which are involved in the attenuation of FGF signaling and are part of the FGF synexpression group. Spry acts at the level of Grb2 and/or the level of Raf. Sef and XFLRT3 are both located at the membrane and can interact directly with FGFR. Sef functions as a negative regulator, whereas XFLRT3 enhances FGF signaling resulting in the phosphorylation of the MAPK ERK. Sef has also been shown to affect the phosphorylation of the MAPK cascade, either at the level of ERK or by preventing the phosphorylation of ERK by MEK (99). MKP3 negatively regulates FGF signaling by dephosphorylation of activated ERK. P, Phosphorylation. [Adapted from Ref. 43 with permission from Elsevier.]</div></div>
