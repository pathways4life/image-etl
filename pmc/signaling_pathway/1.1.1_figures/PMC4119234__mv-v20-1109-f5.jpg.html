From: ERK1/2/COX-2/PGE2 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> mediates GPR91-dependent VEGF release in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Succinate and the GPR91 signaling pathway in the retinas of STZ-induced diabetic rats. Each solid line and arrow denotes a step in an activating pathway. Succinate accumulation triggered by hyperglycemia activates GPR91 signaling, sequentially activating ERK1/2 and then upregulating COX-2 and PGE2 expression, and later increasing VEGF release in retinal ganglion cells. The increase of VEGF induces retinal vascular dysfunction and plays a key role in the pathology of diabetic retinopathy. The long dashed line and vertical lines denotes a step in an inhibiting pathway. U0126 blocks the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and the downstream expression of COX-2, PGE2, and VEGF. NS-398 blocks COX-2 and PGE2 and decreases PGE2-mediated VEGF synthesis. </div></div>
