B) Immunohistochemistry using p-IκBα antibody to determine the extent of NFκB signaling activity in the epidermis of WT (Hr+/+) and Hr−/− animals before and after a single, acute UVB (180 mJ/cm2) irradiation. IκBα is increased constitutively and after irradiation throughout the epidermal layer. C) Immunohistochemistry using p-IκBα antibody to determine the extent of NFκB signaling activity in the epidermis of WT (Hr+/+) and Hr−/− animals at the indicated time points during chronic UVB irradiation (180 mJ/cm2 UVB three times a week for a total of 50 weeks). IκBα is increased constitutively and after irradiation throughout the epidermal layer.</div></div>
