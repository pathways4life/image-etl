Two signaling cascades emanate from the IRS molecules. One may signal survival, cell growth, and cell cycle progression through the PI3K branch and another, which constitutes a cooperative or overlapping pathway, operates through the MAPK cascade. The former can be down-regulated by the lipid phosphatase PTEN and acts independently of the MAPK pathway. Its effects on S6K1 regulate the translational machinery, influencing cell growth and cell division. The MAPK pathway may use different CREB kinases in a context-specific manner.</div></div>
