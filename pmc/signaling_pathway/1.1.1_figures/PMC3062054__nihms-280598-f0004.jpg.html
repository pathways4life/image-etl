From: Roles for Growth Factors in Cancer Progression. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A scheme showing the major therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking growth factor signaling in cancer. The strategies include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the GFs and their receptors, soluble receptors (TRAPs): small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), blockers of heat shock proteins (HSPs), antagonists of specific signaling pathway proteins, as well as inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and methyl-transferase (MTase). Also represented are cytotoxic treatments. Examples of drugs are shown in yellow boxes; therapeutic agents that were approved for clinical use are highlighted in red, and targets are shown in parentheses. See details of signaling pathways in FIGURE 2.</div></div>
