Schematic diagram showing that β1- and β3-mediated CLAN formation is the result of distinct <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways.  From: Distinct ?1 and ?3 integrin pathways converge to regulate cross-linked actin network (CLAN) formation in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Both pathways are dependent upon a SFK, possibly Src. The β1 integrin-activated pathway involves PI3-K while the αvβ3-activated pathway involves CD47 and Rac1 signaling mediated by the GEF Trio. CD47 activation by TSP1 containing the carboxy-terminal sequence found in peptide 4N1K (RFYVVMWK) may be an important regulator of CLAN formation. Convergence of the two pathways could potentially occur at two points. The β1 integrin pathway might also signal through Rac1, but via activation of a Rac1 GEF distinct from Trio. Alternatively, PI-3K could bypass Rac1 completely and the two pathways would converge at a different downstream effector to promote CLAN formation.</div></div>
