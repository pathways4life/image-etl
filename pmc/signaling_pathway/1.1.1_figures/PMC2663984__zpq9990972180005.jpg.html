Binding of Wnt proteins to receptors triggers canonical (β-catenin and destruction complex dependent) or noncanonical (β-catenin and the destruction complex independent) Wnt signaling. In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, the stability of β-catenin is controlled by destruction complex composed by GSK3, APC, and Axin, etc. In addition to β-catenin, the degradation of many different proteins in various functional classes is regulated by the destruction complex and Wnt receptor signaling.</div></div>
