Injurious stimuli, including IL-1β, induce protease-mediated ligand shedding, which is followed by autocrine or paracrine epithelial HER receptor activation. This induces activation of intracellular signaling pathways, including TGF-β and Rac, with subsequent modulation of tight junction and adherens junction proteins and regulation of epithelial cell–cell adhesion. IL-1β activation of HER2/3 through shedding ADAM17-induced shedding of neuregulin (NRG)-1 serves as a prototypical pathway.</div></div>
