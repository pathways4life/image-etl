The mammalian database was used with protein modification being the only parameter used to connect different protein nodes. Pathway Studio added several intermediate nodes (yellow) to complete the pathway. For more information on the proteins shown in this analysis and their relationship see Supplemental Data, Tables S1 and S2.</div></div>
