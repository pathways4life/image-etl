Schematic representation of the effects of ectopic Shh <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> on dorsoventral patterning in the hindbrain of ShhP1 embryos.  From: Activation of Class I transcription factors by low level Sonic hedgehog <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> is mediated by Gli2-dependent and independent mechanisms. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) Low level Shh signaling from the ectopic source in the otic vesicle of ShhP1 embryos (blue arrow) results in an expansion of v0 and v1 interneurons in the adjacent hindbrain. (B) A revised classification scheme for Shh target genes. Class I genes (light blue) are activated by low level Shh signaling and oppose the expression of corresponding Class II genes. Class II genes (navy blue) are activated by high level Shh signaling and oppose the expression of corresponding Class I genes. Dorsal genes (red) are repressed by the lowest level of Shh signaling and are not necessarily opposed by Class I and/or Class II genes. Class I genes are also activated by a Retinoic Acid (RA) signaling pathway operating in parallel to Shh (Novitch et al., 2003).</div></div>
