(A) A whole-kinome siRNA screen using a luminescent readout for WNT activity revealed many potential regulators of WNT signaling. GSK3Î², a known pathway inhibitor, served as an internal control. (B) A secondary screen using some of the strongest hits from the original library was performed for confirmation. (C) List of components of the MAPK cascade identified in the screen. Shades of gray indicate the association with the specific MAPK cascade (ERK5, JNK1, and p38).</div></div>
