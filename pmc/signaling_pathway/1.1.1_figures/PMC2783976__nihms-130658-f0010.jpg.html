Schematic illustration demonstrating putative <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> pathways involved in PDGF-mediated neuroprotection in rat primary neurons.  From: TRPC channel-mediated neuroprotection by PDGF involves Pyk2/ERK/CREB <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PDGF-mediated engagement of the PDGF-β receptor stimulates the PLC/IP3 R pathway, which in turn, activates TRPC channels resulting in elevation of [Ca2+]i transients. [Ca2+]i elevation in turn results in activation of Pyk2/ERK pathways leading to CREB activation and consequently neuronal survival. In addition to this, PDGF/PDGF-βR axis can also activate another distinct pathway - PI3K/Akt, which can also lead to potentiation of neuronal survival.</div></div>
