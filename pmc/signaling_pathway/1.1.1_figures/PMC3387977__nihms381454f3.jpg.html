Multiple points along the EGFR signaling pathway, indicated with arrows, are currently being evaluated as therapeutic targets in the treatment of NSCLC. Inhibition of EGFR activation can occur by targeting EGFR itself and/or its downstream mediators. Small molecule TKIs and other agents are shown associated with their respective targets.
