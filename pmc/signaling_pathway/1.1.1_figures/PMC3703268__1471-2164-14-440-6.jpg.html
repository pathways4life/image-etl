Size of node represents frequency of amplification or deletion in patient population. Color of node indicates whether gene is amplified (red), deleted (green), or unchanged (gray). Lines indicate interactions. Blue dotted line separates genes within the pathway from genes that interact with the pathway based on the protein-protein interaction database.</div></div>
