A hypothetical schematic of the contribution of SCARA5 to HCC via activation of the FAK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span>..  From: Genetic and epigenetic silencing of SCARA5 may contribute to human hepatocellular carcinoma by activating FAK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>             . </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The physiological function of SCARA5 is to inhibit the activity of the FAK signaling pathway by physically associating with FAK. In this way, downregulation of SCARA5 due to epigenetic and genetic events in HCC may contribute to tumorigenesis and progression, possibly by activating the FAK signaling pathway via initiation of the FAK-Src-Cas complex tyrosine phosphorylation cascade, along with increased MMP-9 activity. Based on the published data (52, 53, 67â€“71), the activating FAK-Src-Cas complex leads to tumor growth and metastasis, by promoting cell motility, invasion, cell cycle progression, survival, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, possibly through the secondary signaling pathways (indicated in bold).
