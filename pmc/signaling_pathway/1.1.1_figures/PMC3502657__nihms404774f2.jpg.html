Of these mechanisms, the most-studied mechanism is DAF-16/FOXO regulation. Germline-less animals require specific cofactors (not required in daf-2/InR mutants) for activation of DAF-16/FOXO in the nucleus of intestinal cells. DAF-12/FXR, TCER-1/TCERG1, KRI-1/KRIT-1 and PHI-62 all function specifically in germline-less animals, whereas DAF-18/PTEN, SMK-1/SMEK and HSF-1 are common between the insulin/IGF-1 and germline signaling pathways. Cell-nonautonomous regulation of DAF-16/FOXO is also mediated through a microRNA, mir-71, which is produced in neurons.Factors with longevity-promoting effects are in green and those with lifespan-limiting effects are in red. TOR effects are listed in grey to indicate that these links are presently inferred. Transcription factors are in boxes. See text for details.</div></div>
