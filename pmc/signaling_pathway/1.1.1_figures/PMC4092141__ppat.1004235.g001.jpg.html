Unfavorable conditions stimulate dauer entry (left panel) by down-regulating cGMP production, increasing expression of antagonistic insulin-like peptides that down-regulate IIS, decreasing expression of the dauer TGFβ ligand, and inhibiting production of DAs. When dauer larvae encounter favorable conditions, these pathways are hypothesized to act in reverse. Dotted lines signify down-regulated signaling through the pathway, while black lines signify up-regulated signaling through the pathway. Colored proteins are active; grayed out proteins are inactive. Grayed out ligands are absent. Adapted from [12], [32], [43], [91].</div></div>
