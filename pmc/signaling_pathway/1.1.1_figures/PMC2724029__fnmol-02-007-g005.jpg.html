Networks were identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and subsequently modified using Bibliosphere, PathwayArchitect, GO and pathway databases. The intensity of the red color indicates the extent of gene upregulation. Connecting lines with arrowheads indicate activation of proteins, without arrowheads proteinâ€“protein interaction. Continuous and dashed lines are direct and indirect activation/interaction, respectively. For node description see Figure 4.</div></div>
