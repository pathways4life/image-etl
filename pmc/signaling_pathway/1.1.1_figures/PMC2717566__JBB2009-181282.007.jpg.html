From: p,p?-DDE Induces Apoptosis of Rat Sertoli Cells via a FasL-Dependent <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model of  p,p′-DDE-induced signaling pathways leading to apoptosis. ROS generation might play a critical role in the initiation of p,p′-DDE-induced apoptosis of Sertoli cells through two mechanisms, one was the mitochondria-mediated pathway including elevation of ROS, decrease in ΔΨm along with the cytochrome c release from mitochondria into the cytosol, and activation of the caspase-9 and -3 in our previous study; and the other was the elevation of ROS, which resulted in activation of NF-κB, expression of FasL and triggered FasL-dependent pathway (FasL/caspase-8/-3 signaling module) in our present study.</div></div>
