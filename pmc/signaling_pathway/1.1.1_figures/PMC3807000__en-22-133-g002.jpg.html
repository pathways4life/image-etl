Activation of PI3K-Atk signaling suppresses TSC1 and TSC2 complex leading to inactivation of Rheb (isoform of Ras superfamily) and release of mTOR from mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1). Dysfunctions of FMRP as a PIKE (PI3K enhancer) repressor in fragile X syndrome and TSC1/TSC2 as an mTOR repressor in tuberous sclerosis produce defects of neuronal development and synaptic plasticity with autistic behavioral phenotypes. In autism, mutations of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) also induce abnormal hyperactivity of PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. Besides mTOR-dependent pathway, mTOR-independent pathway such as Epac2-Rap signaling affects neurite formation and autism phenotypes. Epac2, autism candidate gene RAPGEF4, is activated by cAMP binding and then changes an inactivated form to activated form of Rap which can regulate calpain via PLCÎµ pathway. Neurofibromin encoded by NF1 normally leads to inactivation of Ras. However, mutations of neurofibromin in Neurofibromatosis 1 causes overactivation of Ras/ERK and PI3K signaling, leading to inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 complex and release of mTOR from Rheb suppression.</div></div>
