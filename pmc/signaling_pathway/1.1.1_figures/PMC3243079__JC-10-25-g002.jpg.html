Upon stimulation by growth factors, ERα is able to initiate cytoplasmic signaling cascades, such as the MAPK and PI3K pathways. ERα is phosphorylated in the non-genomic pathway by a tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) in a ligand-independent manner and can promote unregulated gene transcription</div></div>
