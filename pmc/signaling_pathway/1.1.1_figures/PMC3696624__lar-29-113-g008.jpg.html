Total homogenates were prepared from brain tissue of Tg2576 mice treated with SH-CKJ for 8 weeks. Thirty micrograms of protein per sample was immunoblotted with antibody for each protein (A). The intensity of each band was determined using an imaging densitometer, and the relative level of each protein was calculated based on the intensity of actin (B). Three samples were assayed in triplicate via Western blot analysis. Values of the data represent the meansÂ±SD.</div></div>
