A positive or negative role of HIPK2 in Wnt signaling depends on the availability and type of TCF proteins that are present in the responding cell. HIPK2 would inhibit the pathway upon phosphorylation of an activator type TCF, such as LEF1, but would activate it upon phosphorylation of a repressor, such as TCF3.</div></div>
