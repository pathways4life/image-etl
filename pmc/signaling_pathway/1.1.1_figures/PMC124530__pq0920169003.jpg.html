Culture supernatants for the strains shown, which had been grown with or without the addition of pyoverdine, were serially diluted. and the presence of exotoxin A was determined with an anti-exotoxin antibody. toxA promoter activity was determined by measuring the amounts of Î²-galactosidase produced by strains carrying the toxA-lacZ reporter fusion plasmid construct pPZ-toxA. All SDs were less than 12%. ND, not determined.</div></div>
