Each pathway conveys a particular class of stress, energy or environmental, and terminates with a PP2C phosphatase specific for RsbV-P. Dephosphorylated RsbV binds the RsbW anti-σ factor, forcing the release of σB. In the energy pathway the RsbP phosphatase has an N-terminal PAS domain. In addition to RsbP activity, RsbQ α/β hydrolase activity is also required for energy signaling. Neither the parameter sensed by the PAS domain nor the substrate of the RsbQ hydrolase is known. In the environmental pathway RsbU has an N-terminal RsbU_N domain, which is required for the RsbT regulator to bind and activate the phosphatase by direct protein-protein interaction.</div></div>
