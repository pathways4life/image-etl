Oncogenic kinases for cancer therapy.

EGFR and ErbB2/Her2 are examples of oncogenic RTKs. Downstream mitogenic signaling cascades include the canonical Ras signaling pathway and the PI3K pathway. These protein kinases typically phosphorylate serine/threonine residues. Here, mitogenic signaling protein kinases are boxed. Oncogenic mutations have been found in AKT and Raf among the protein kinases.</div></div>
