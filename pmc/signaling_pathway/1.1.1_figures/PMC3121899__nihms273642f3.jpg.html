(Left Panel) EPCR interacts with caveolin-1 (Cav-1) within lipid-rafts of endothelial cells when it is not occupied by the Gla-domain of protein C. Thrombin cleavage of PAR-1 activates RhoA, up-regulates the NF-κB pathway and elicits disruptive signaling responses by signaling through G12/13 and/or Gq proteins. (Right Panel) The occupancy of EPCR by protein C leads to dissociation of EPCR from caveolin-1 and a switch in the specificity of PAR-1, presumably by signaling via the Gi-protein. Under these conditions, the thrombin cleavage of PAR-1 activates Rac1, inhibits the activation of the NF-κB pathway and initiates protective responses in endothelial cells. See the text for more detail. The figure is adopted from Ref. 39 with modifications.</div></div>
