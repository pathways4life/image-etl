Arrowheads indicate P-rMLC staining in ring channels of  the proximal oocytes. DNA is blue. Scale bar: 10 Î¼m. (<b>E</b>) A model for  the control of germline proliferation, oocyte growth and meiotic maturation by  GLP-1 and MSP signaling (see text for details). P-rMLC is shown in brackets to  indicate that MSP signaling is sufficient to promote rMLC phosphorylation in  the germline, whereas the glp-1 pathway appears dispensable.</div></div>
