Scale bar corresponds to 2 mm. (B) The “threshold shift” model for Set3C function in triggering morphogenesis. The cAMP/PKA signaling pathway transmits environmental information, thereby shaping the morphogenetic change. In wild type cells (left panel), the sensitivity of the pathway to adequate signals is antagonized by the SetC. If the Set3C is disrupted or impaired (right panel), the threshold for morphogenetic conversion is shifted, and the pathway responds to milder inducing stimuli by triggering filamentation. In addition, metabolites such as adenine also modulates the activity of the pathway through as yet undisclosed mechanisms.</div></div>
