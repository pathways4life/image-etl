From: Notch-Deficient Skin Induces a Lethal Systemic B-Lymphoproliferative Disorder by Secreting TSLP, a Sentinel for Epidermal Integrity. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">RBP-j-dependent and independent Notch signaling is required for proper epidermal differentiation and lipid biogenesis in the skin to form a competent barrier. The RBP-j-independent signals may be non-cell autonomous. Embryonic loss of Notch signaling leads to aberrant epidermal differentiation/lipid biogenesis and, therefore, the defective barrier formation. In response, TSLP is released by keratinocytes that fail to differentiate, triggering a systemic B-LPD in newborns that results in neonatal lethality at the highest level.</div></div>
