Schematic illustration of the hypothesized inhibition of β-catenin by canonical Shh signaling together with Jagged2-Notch2. <b>Left side:</b> If Shh binds to Ptch, it looses its inhibitory effect on SMO. This activates the Gli proteins for target gene translation (left side). The APC mutation in APCmin/+ leads to accumulation of cytosolic and nuclear β-catenin and leads to Wnt-specific target gene translation (<b>middle</b>). The activation of the Shh signaling is able to inhibit β-catenin downstream of the degradation complex. It is unknown whether this inhibition mechanism works through a novel pathway initiated by the receptor complex Ptch/SMO or takes place further downstream. <b>Right side:</b> JAG2 might be a second control mechanism for β-catenin via an unknown mechanism, as canonical Notch signaling is not required.</div></div>
