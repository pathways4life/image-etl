From: Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 Is Required for Abnormal Proliferation and Survival of TSC2-Deficient Cells: Relevance to Pulmonary Lymphangioleiomyomatosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic representation of a potential mechanism of IFN-γ- and STAT3-dependent cell growth modulated by TSC2/mTOR signaling pathway. Top, in normal unstimulated cells, tumor suppressor TSC2 inhibits mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway and cell proliferation. Treatment with IFN-γ activates canonical STAT1 signaling, induces modest phosphorylation of STAT3, and attenuates cell proliferation. Bottom, loss of TSC2 function leads to the constitutive activation of mTOR/S6K1 and increased STAT3 activity, which are both required for abnormal cell proliferation. IFN-γ induces STAT1 activation and increases STAT3 phosphorylation. Re-expression of TSC2 or inhibition of mTOR activity inhibits IFN-γ-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation and synergizes with IFN-γ in inhibition of cell proliferation.</div></div>
