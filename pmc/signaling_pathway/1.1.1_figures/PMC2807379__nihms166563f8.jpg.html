From: Nephronophthisis: Disease Mechanisms of a Ciliopathy. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">In the hedgehog pathway of vertebrates, upon binding of the Shh ligand to the patched (Ptch1) receptor, repression of the smoothened (Smo) receptor to be inserted into the cilium membrane is relieved, and posttranslational modification of the Gli transcription factors within the cilium induces both their activator (GliAct) and repressor (GliR) functions. Several studies in mice have demonstrated that ciliary proteins are needed for hedgehog signaling. Recently, the related transcription factor Gli-similar 2 (GLIS2) was found to be mutated in NPHP type 7 (from: Huangfu &amp; Anderson Development, 2005)141.</div></div>
