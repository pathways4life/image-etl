From: Secretion of L-glutamate from osteoclasts through transcytosis. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed L-glutamate signaling during bone resorption. (left) Under the normal physiological conditions, a proportion of VGLUT1-containing small clear vesicles may fuse with the transcytotic vesicle. Upon stimulation with KCl or ATP, L-glutamate and bone degradation products are secreted through transcytosis. Then, the released L-glutamate acts as a negative feedback regulator through mGluR8-mediated signaling pathway, keeping osteoclasts in the suppressed state. (right) In osteoclasts of VGLUT1−/− mice, L-glutamate-mediated signaling pathway is impaired. This may induce the desuppressive state of osteoclasts, causing stimulated bone resorption followed by osteoporosis. N, nucleus.</div></div>
