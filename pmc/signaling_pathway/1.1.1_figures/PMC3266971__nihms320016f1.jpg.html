From: Involvement of the PI3K/Akt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in Myxoid/Round Cell Liposarcoma. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">PI3K/Akt pathway. Binding of growth factor to a receptor tyrosine kinase, such as IGF1R, activates PI3K, which phosphorylates a signaling molecule, phospatidyl inositol (PIP2), to its active form (PIP3). This in turn triggers a subsequent signaling cascade via Akt that results in phosphorylation of downstream targets such as S6 and 4EBP1. PI3K signaling is inhibited by PTEN, which dephosphorylates PIP3 to PIP2, thereby returning it to the inactive state.</div></div>
