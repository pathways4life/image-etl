Subsequently, TNIK binds to active β-catenin and this complex is recruited to the nucleus, where TNIK directly phosphorylates Tcf, converting the Tcf/Lef-complex from a transcriptional repressor into a transcriptional activator of Wnt target genes. In CML, the Wnt signaling pathway is constantly activated by BCR/ABL-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of active β-catenin, resulting in enhanced stability and leading to pathological LSC proliferation/differentiation. CD27 signaling leads to recruitment of TRAF2 and subsequent activation of TNIK, promoting nuclear translocation of the active β-catenin/TNIK complex. Thereby, CD27 signaling contributes to increased transcription of Wnt target genes.</div></div>
