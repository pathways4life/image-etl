APPL is a novel regulator of Wnt-PCP pathway. In the presence of Wnt signaling, Fz binds Dsh, which needs to be phosphorylated by Abelson kinase to correctly relocalize to the membrane. We propose that Appl is part of the membrane complex formed by the core PCP proteins Fz1 and Vang. In turn, Appl recruits Abelson kinase to the complex and positively modulates Dsh phosphorylation. The subsequent activation of the signaling is required for MB Î²-axon growth.</div></div>
