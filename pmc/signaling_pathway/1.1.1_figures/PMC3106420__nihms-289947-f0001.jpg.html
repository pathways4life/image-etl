Differentially expressed genes (greater than 1.5 fold) were derived from comparing 6-week old Atp7b−/− to wild-type littermates; or 26 week old LEC rats—to 4 week old LEC rats. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) defined 218 genes from Atp7b−/− and 1208 from LEC rats eligible for pathway analysis. These genes were queried against the IPA pathway library to identify over-represented signaling pathways that were significantly down-regulated. The significance [–log (P-value)] of a given pathway is measured by the likelihood that the pathway is associated with the dataset by random chance using the Fischer’s exact test. Striped bars Pathways common to Atp7b−/− mice and LEC rats. Black bars Pathways unique to Atp7b−/− mice or LEC rats. *Pathways involved in lipid or steroid metabolism</div></div>
