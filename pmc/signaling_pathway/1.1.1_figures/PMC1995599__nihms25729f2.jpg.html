PTH-stimulated survival <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in osteoblasts.  From: MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR MECHANISMS OF THE ANABOLIC EFFECT OF INTERMITTENT PTH. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The upper panel depicts PTH-activated survival pathways, and the negative feedback on these pathways caused by stimulation of Runx2 degradation. The lower panel depicts the transient anti-apoptotic signaling and the changes in Runx2 that occur upon each injection of PTH. The net result is a temporary delay in osteoblast apoptosis. As injected PTH disappears from the circulation, Runx2 returns to basal levels and the cells are positioned to generate another episode of anti-apoptotic signaling in response to a subsequent injection. With sustained PTH elevation, on the other hand, the negative feedback pathway remains active, and further anti-apoptosis signaling is abrogated.</div></div>
