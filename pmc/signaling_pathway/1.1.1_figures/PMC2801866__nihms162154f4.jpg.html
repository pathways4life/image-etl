From: Molecular Regulation of Tumor Angiogenesis and Perfusion via Redox <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The NO/cGMP pathway is a signaling node for pro- and anti-angiogenic signaling. In addition to VEGF, angiopoietin-1, estrogens, and insulin can activate eNOS to increase NO synthesis in endothelial cells. TSP1 signaling via CD36 and CD47 inhibits downstream elements of this pathway. Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) is another known ligand of CD36 that could inhibit angiogenesis via an overlapping pathway. In addition, oxLDL signaling inhibits protein kinase CÎ±, which phosphorylates eNOS at Thr495 and activates NADPH oxidase (NOX), and the resulting superoxide depletes NO levels. The angiogenesis inhibitors endostatin and vasoinhibins activate the phosphatase PP2A, which dephosphorylates and thereby inactivates eNOS.</div></div>
