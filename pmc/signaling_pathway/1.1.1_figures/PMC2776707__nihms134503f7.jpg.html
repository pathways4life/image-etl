A model for SKN-1 functions under normal conditions.  From: Condition-adapted stress and longevity gene regulation by Caenorhabditis elegans SKN-1/Nrf. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">A positive feedback interaction with ins-7 and the DAF-2 pathway is featured. SKN-1 upregulates many genes that promote detoxification and stress resistance, and also downregulates genes that decrease stress resistance, lifespan, or both. Among the SKN-1-downregulated genes are both ins-7 and pdk-1 (not shown), each of which promotes DAF-2 pathway signaling (see text). The DAF-2 pathway in turn inhibits SKN-1 (Tullet et al. 2008).</div></div>
