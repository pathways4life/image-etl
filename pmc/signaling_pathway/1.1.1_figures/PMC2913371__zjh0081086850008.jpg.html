Based on our current findings we propose that morphine alters the hypoxic activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Hypoxia increased p38 MAPK activity, resulting in decreased HIF-1α hydroxylation and increased phosphorylation leading to an increased HIF-1α nuclear accumulation. Morphine treatment reduced hypoxia induced MAPK p38 and thus HIF-1 activation.</div></div>
