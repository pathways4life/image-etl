Scheme of TLR4 and CCR8 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> cross talk in mouse PMφ..  From: Chemokine Receptor CCR8 Is Required for Lipopolysaccharide-Triggered Cytokine Production in Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">LPS triggers TLR4 signaling and induces NF-κB and MAPK activation, possibly together with CCR8 activation, which results in the production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10. CCR8 is required for full activation of both signaling pathways. Production of IL-6 and TNF-α involves both the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. IL-10 production is largely dependent on the JNK pathway and is mediated by CCR8 activation. In addition to the antagonistic effect on CCR8, possible sites of action of R243 are indicated.</div></div>
