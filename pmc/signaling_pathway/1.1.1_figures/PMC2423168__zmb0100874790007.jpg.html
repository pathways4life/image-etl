(a) Cdc1p is presumed to be a lipid phosphatase, and we suggest that Per1p is needed to generate the substrate for Cdc1p. According to this model, inactivating Cdc1p causes its substrate to accumulate to toxic levels and also causes accumulation of a nontoxic precursor lipid. When Per1p is inactivated, only the nontoxic precursor accumulates, so a per1Î” mutation suppresses the lethality of cdc1 mutations. This nontoxic precursor may correspond to the unidentified lipid that was visualized in the experiment shown in Fig. 6. (b) In cdc1 cells, accumulation of the toxic phosphorylated lipid activates both Mpk1p- and Cch1p-dependent Ca2+ signaling. The Ca2+ signaling activates calcineurin. In a calcineurin-independent pathway, strong Ca2+ signaling depolarizes actin. We speculate that strong Ca2+ signaling also inhibits Golgi tethering. These two effects of strong Ca2+ signaling synergize to cause a pronounced defect in Golgi inheritance.</div></div>
