From: Central serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptor dysfunction in depression and epilepsy: the missing link?. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Anatomical and pharmacological properties of the 5-HT2A receptors in the brain. (A)</b> 5-HT2A receptors (5-HT2A-Rs) are located in brain regions involved in emotionality and epilepsy. <b>(B)</b> Interactions between 5-HT2A-Rs and beta-arrestin 2. According to the nature of the 5-HT2A-Rs agonist (endogenous/exogenous), 5-HT2A-Rs-mediated signaling may recruit beta-arrestin2-dependant or -independent pathways (signaling phases). Such a beta-arrestin2 is also involved in the down regulation/internalization of the 5-HT2A-Rs (arresting phase). <b>(C)</b> Dimerization of the 5-HT2A-Rs with GPCRs is necessary to activate signaling pathway.</div></div>
