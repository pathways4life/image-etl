Black colored letters and arrows indicate the palmitate and TLR4/MD-2-mediated inflammatory pathway. Red colored letters and arrows indicate the RP105/MD-1-mediated inflammatory pathway. Precise RP105-mediated signaling in adipose tissue inflammation remains unclear, but signaling pathway other than NFÎºB and JNK may be responsible for RP105-dependnet adipose tissue inflammation.</div></div>
