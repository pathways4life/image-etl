Binding of BDNF to TrkB activates different intracellular signaling cascades, including the PI3K/Akt, Ras/ERK (MAPK) and PLCγ pathways [12]. Phosphorylation of Y490 of TrkB leads to recruitment of adaptor proteins such as Shc, Grb2 and Gab1 and subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway [192] and Rho family of GTPases (RhoA, Rac, Cdc42), which positively regulate actin polymerization through downstream signaling including ROCK/PAK, LimK and Cofilin [151-153]. Another downstream effector of the PI3K/Akt pathway is GSK-3, whose activity is negatively regulated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation [193]. One of the downstream targets of GSK-3 is β-catenin, which can be translocated into the nucleus to promote gene expression. The mTOR pathway, which facilitates local translation and the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, is also regulated by PI3K/Akt signaling [122]. Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling is believed to positively modulate spinogenesis, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis, thus inducing antidepressant effects. In addition to inductive effects on gene expression, the Ras/ERK (MAPK) pathway also acts through Rho family of GTPases, mTOR signaling, and synapsin to induce spinogenesis, synaptogenesis and neurogenesis (not shown) [122, 153, 154]. Phosphorylation of Y816 of TrkB recruits PLCγ [194], inducing the hydrolysis of PIP2 to IP3 and DAG. IP3 regulates calcium release and CAMK activation, while DAG activates PKC. Both IP3/CAMK and DAG/PKC signaling regulate synaptic plasticity [195], however their roles in depression remain largely unknown.</div></div>
