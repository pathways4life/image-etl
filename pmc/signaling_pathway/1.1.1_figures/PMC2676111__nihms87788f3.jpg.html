Chondrocytes in serum-free confluent monolayer cultures were stimulated with or without 10ng/ml IL-7 for 0–120 minutes. The cell lysates were immunoblotted for the phosphorylated and total JAK-3 and STAT-3 signaling proteins. <b>B.</b> DNA binding activity of STAT-3 was measured in nuclear extracts by using the TransAM ELISA according to manufacturer’s protocol. <b>C.</b> Chondrocytes were pretreated for 45 minutes with a JAK-3 inhibitor (10 uM) before stimulation with IL-7. Cell lysates were immunoblotted for the phosphorylated and total JAK-3 and STAT-3 signaling proteins <b>D</b>. The DNA binding activity of STAT-3 was measured in the nuclear extracts following 30 minutes incubation with IL-7. Values in panel B and D are the mean and SEM of three independent experiments.</div></div>
