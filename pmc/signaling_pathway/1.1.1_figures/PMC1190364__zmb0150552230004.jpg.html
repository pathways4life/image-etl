(A) The wild-type (WT) strain or the indicated rim deletion strains from the yeast deletion collection, as denoted on the left-hand side of the panel, were transformed with pLGn+3×NRE22D, and β-galactosidase expression was monitored by a colony overlay assay. (B) Expression of Rim101(1-531)0.3HA restores NRE22D-mediated repression to a rim13 strain. Wild-type, rim101Δ, RIM101(1-531).3HA-HIS3MX6, rim13Δ, and rim13Δ RIM101(1-531)0.3HA-HIS3MX6 strains, as denoted on the right-hand side of the panel, were transformed with pLG312n (no insert) or pLGn+3×NRE22D, and β-galactosidase expression was monitored by a colony overlay assay.</div></div>
