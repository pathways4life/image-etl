The figure roughly summarizes interactions between signaling components of the IL-15R and NKG2D, which was proposed by Horng et al. [129]. Jak3, as a part of canonical IL-15R signaling pathway, is essential for the phosphorylation of DAP10. Activated DAP10 recruits PI3K and Grb2, which control proliferation, survival, and cytotoxicity of NK cells. DAP10 also associates with IL-15Rβ and -γ chains</div></div>
