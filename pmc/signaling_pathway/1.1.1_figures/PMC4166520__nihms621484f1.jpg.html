From: ATX-LPA Receptor Axis in Inflammation and Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">ATX hydrolyzes lysophospholipids, in particular lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), to produce bioactive LPA. Newly produced LPA acts on its own GPCRs via at least three distinct classes of heterotrimeric G proteins — Gq, Gi and G12/13 activating multiple downstream pathways and evoke its biological effects, including RAS-ERK pathway through Gi and Gq; PI3K-AKT pathway through Gi; PKC –GSK30β – β-catenin pathway through Gq (and /or Gi); Rho-CDC42 pathway through G12/13; Src-Stat pathway through Gi, which induce expression and activation of multiple transcriptors including STAT3, NF-κB, ATF-2, which induce cell proliferation and production of cytokines. The cytokines bind to their receptors inducing Stat 3 and 5 production and activation.</div></div>
