From: A role for the NG2 proteoglycan in glioma progression. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Functional Interactions of NG2. On the apical cell surface, the thr-2314 phosphorylated NG2 proteoglycan (green oval) activates α3β1 integrin (yellow dimer) signaling to promote enhanced proliferation. NG2 also promotes cell proliferation via potentiation of growth factor/growth factor receptor signaling (indicated here by red FGF and blue FGFR dimer). On leading edge lamellipodia, thr-2256 phosphorylated NG2 activates α3β1 integrin signaling to promote enhanced motility. NG2-mediated integrin signaling can also enhance cell survival via the PI3/AKT pathway. NG2 also provides a linkage between the cell surface and the extracellular matrix via its interaction with type VI collagen (triple turqouise rods). Signaling pathways are shown in abbreviated format due to space considerations.</div></div>
