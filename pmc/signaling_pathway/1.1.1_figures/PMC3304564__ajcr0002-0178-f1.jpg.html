From: Therapeutic implications of targeting the PI3Kinase/AKT/mTOR <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> module in melanoma therapy. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The PI3K/AKT signaling module and cross-talk with other pathway. Upon binding of growth factors to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) a cascade of events are triggered resulting in the activation of PI3Kinase and subsequent AKT activation (module I). This cascade leads to inhibition of pro-apoptotic signaling molecules (BAD, BIM, BAX, Cas-pase 9) or induction of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Mcl-1, BCL-XL, Bcl-w conferring a growth advantage to the tumor cells. One of the major targets of AKT is the mTOR (module Ii) which is also implicated in cell growth and metabolism. The intricacy of the AKT pathway is further complicated by its cross-talk, via various positive and negative regulatory feedback loops, with multiple major cell survival pathways including: NF-ÎºB (module II), RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK MAPK (module III), p38MAPK (module IV), JNK MAPK (module V). This elaborate network of signaling pathways will amplify the anti-apoptotic signaling and confer a resistant phenotype to the malignant melanoma cells.</div></div>
