Tethered TIR dimer induce MyD88 oligomerization, which triggers assembly of the Myddosome complex. Right, model of the assembly of Myddosome induced by TLR dimerization: sequential addition of MyD88 through interactions with TIR of TLRs and TIRs of MyD88 assembles the DD complex and triggers phosphorylation of IRAK kinases.</div></div>
