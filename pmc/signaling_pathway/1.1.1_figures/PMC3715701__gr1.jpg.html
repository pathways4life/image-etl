This figure provides an overview of the cellular signaling pathways involving myosin 1c function. In particular, myosin 1c has been shown to play a role in (1) the integrin-mediated signaling pathways underlying cell migration, (2) the signaling events facilitating pathogen uptake by macropinocytosis, (3) the Neph1 translocation and signaling mediating podocyte foot formation, (4) the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced insulin resistance pathways, (5) insulin-stimulated GLUT4 transport to the plasma membrane, and (6) mechanical signal transduction in the hair cells of the inner ear. The molecular role of myosin 1c in each pathway is outlined and additional key signaling players are displayed for reference. This presentation of the diverse assembly of signaling pathways involving myosin 1c function highlights the importance of this motor in cellular signaling.
