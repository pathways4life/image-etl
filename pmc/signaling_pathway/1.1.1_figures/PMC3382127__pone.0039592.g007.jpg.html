A JAK2/STAT1 pathway is also activated, and subsequent upregulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 inhibits TLR3-mediated signaling by targeting different branches of the signaling pathways. SOCS1 inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation and CXCR7 internalization, while SOCS3 inhibits IRF1 upregulation and the internalization of both CXCR4 and CXCR7.</div></div>
