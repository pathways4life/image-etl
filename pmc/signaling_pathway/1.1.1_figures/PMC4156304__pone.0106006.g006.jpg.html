Host RNA polymerases transcribe HIV genomic RNA, which is then exported into the cytoplasm and packaged into infectious virions. However, some HIV transcripts can be processed in the host RNA interference pathway into mature viral miRNA. HIV miRNAs are packaged into multi-vesicular bodies and released by macrophages encapsulated in exosomes. Exosomes are disseminated either locally or systemically to be taken up by bystander macrophages, trafficking GU-rich vmiR88 and vmiR99 to the endosomal TLR8. Through this non-RNAi function of miRNAs that is distinct from the well-established role of miRNAs in RNA interference, vmiR88 and vmiR99 induce TLR8-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway that leads to downstream release of TNFÎ± leading to chronic immune activation.</div></div>
