Angiogenic and cell proliferating signaling cascades are upregulated in RCC tumor cells. VEGF and other related growth factors secreted by tumor cells stimulate angiogenic signaling in the surrounding vascular endothelial cells. In response to growth factor signaling mediated through VEGF, PDGF and KIT receptors, PI-3-kinase and Ras effectors activate HIF transcription factors, which in turn switch on gene expression needed for angiogenesis and cell proliferation in endothelial cells. In addition to the angiogenic pathway, the Wnt and HGF pathways are also upregulated in RCC tumor cells. While VEGF-targeted therapy for metastatic RCC is focused on blocking angiogenic signaling in vascular endothelial cells surrounding the tumor, mTOR inhibitors act directly on the tumor cells to suppress growth.</div></div>
