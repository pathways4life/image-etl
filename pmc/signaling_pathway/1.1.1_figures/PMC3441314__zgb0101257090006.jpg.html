The scavenger molecule CD14 in membrane-associated or sCD14 form binds LPS and localizes to a TLR4 signaling complex. A phospho-protein cascade, including IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)1 and -4 and TRAF6, serves as a signaling hub that leads into multiple downstream pathways, including NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK. NF-κB pathway is initiated by TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-dependent phosphorylation of IKKα/β, which subsequently phosphorylates the inhibitory protein IκBα, triggering its ubiquitination and degradation. Degradation of IκBα releases p50/p65, which is phophorylated and translocated to the nucleus to initiate transcription of proinflammatory genes. PI3K/AKT signaling is triggered by receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIP) and culminates with inhibition of proinflammatory signaling/transcription and/or enhancement of anti-inflammatory gene expression. MAPK signaling is triggered by activation of proximal MAP3K proteins, followed by downstream activation of Mek1/2 and Erk1/2 and induction of proinflammatory genes. NFV inhibits proteasome activity, leading to accumulation of misfolded proteins and activation of the UPR, including activation of PP1 and possibly PP2, which can be inhibited chemically with calyculin A (CA) and okadaic acid (OA), respectively.</div></div>
