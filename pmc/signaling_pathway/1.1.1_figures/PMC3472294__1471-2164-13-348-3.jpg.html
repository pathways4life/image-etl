Statistical ranking of pathways with the commonly selected 179 genes using SAM analysis. The x-axis displays the -log of the p-value calculated by Fisher's exact test, right-tailed. <b>B</b>. Gene plot showing the influence of individual genes of the integrin signaling pathway produced by a global test. The influence on the y-axis is represented as the p-value, the extent of correlation between SF2 (radiosensitivity) and gene expression in a gene set. A lower p-value means that the gene is well correlated between SF2 and the gene expression value. <b>C</b>. Integrin signaling pathway interaction with identified adhesion molecules from the 31 radiosensitivity signature. (References from Ingenuity knowledge base, Additional file 6).</div></div>
