U87MG (A) and U118MG (B) cells were stimulated with IL-22 and harvested at indicated times. Thirty mg of protein lysates was analyzed for P-STAT3 (Tyr705) and total STAT3 by western blot analysis. The density of each P-STAT3 band was corrected for variance in loading, using the density of the corresponding total STAT3. The expression level was evaluated as the ratio of phosphorylated STAT3 protein densities between control (0 min) and treated cells. Histograms are means Â± SEM of three independent experiments. *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001; when compared with control.</div></div>
