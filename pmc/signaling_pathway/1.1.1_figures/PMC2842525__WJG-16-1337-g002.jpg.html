Binding of IFN-α to its cognate receptor on the cell surface results in activation of the Janus activated kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling pathway culminating in the production of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), many of which have anti-viral properties that act to limit HCV infection. Alcohol inhibits Y701, decreases interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) activity, and subsequently dampens the ISG response.</div></div>
