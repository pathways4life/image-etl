Transcription of a puc-lacZ reporter gene is normally low or absent in the wing disc (A). Increased puc-lacZ expression in sds22 or PP1<b>β</b> mutant migrating cells (B″,C″, green arrowheads) suggests that loss of either sds22 or PP1<b>β</b> activates puc transcription in response to JNK pathway activation. (D–F) Third instar eye-antennal discs are labeled with MMP1, another downstream target of JNK signaling. Compared to the control disc (D), sds22 (E) or PP1<b>α</b> (F) mutant discs show strong activation of MMP1 expression.</div></div>
