High TGF-β pathway activity score (76–100%) was significantly (log-rank, p = 0.006) associated with a worse disease-specific survival. (<b>B</b>) Immunohistochemical analyses using phospho-specific SMAD2 (pSMAD2) antibody of control (c) or SB431542 treated 786-O cells. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin. Original magnification, ×40. (<b>C</b>) pSMAD2 is expressed in vivo. Immunohistochemistry of pSMAD2 in nine CCRCC tumors, that all showed positive nuclear staining. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin. Original magnification, ×40.</div></div>
