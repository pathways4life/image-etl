From: Endothelial Cells Provide Feedback Control for Vascular Remodeling Through a Mechanosensitive Autocrine TGF-? <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Regulation of perlecan requires autocrine TGF-β signaling, p38 MAPK and ERK signaling pathways. <b>(a)</b> Mechanical strain induces increased TGF-β production by human endothelial cells. Results shown are an ELISA assay after subtracting TGF-β in growth media. This effect is blocked by inhibitors of the ERK signaling pathway (U0126) and p38 MAPK signaling pathway (SB 293063). *p &lt; 0.05 versus all other groups; **p &lt; 0.05 significantly different from all groups except unloaded samples with SB293062; other comparisons not shown for simplicity. <b>(b)</b> The p38 and ERK signaling pathways are activated by 24 hrs of mechanical strain. Endothelial cells were treated with inhibitors one hour prior to exposure to 24 hrs of mechanical strain. Western blotting analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of smad 2, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in the absence of inhibitors. <b>(c)</b> Autocrine TGF-β signaling is needed for maximal phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and Smad 2. Endothelial cells were treated with a neutralizing antibody to TGF-β for 1 hr prior to 24 hrs of cyclic mechanical strain. Western blotting analysis of intracellular signaling intermediates showed reduced activation of Smad 2, ERK1/2, and p38 by mechanical strain in the presence of a neutralizing antibody to TGF-β. <b>(d)</b> Inhibitors to p38 or MEK block load-mediated increases in soluble perlecan. <b>(e)</b> A neutralizing antibody to TGF-β blocks load-induced increase in soluble perlecan. <b>(f)</b> Addition of 100 pg/ml TGF-β increased perlecan expression even in the absence of mechanical strain. An inhibitor to TGF-β receptor I signaling, 200 nM of [3-(Pyridin-2-yl)-4-(4-quinonyl)] -1H-pyrazole, blocked perlecan upregulation by mechanical load.</div></div>
