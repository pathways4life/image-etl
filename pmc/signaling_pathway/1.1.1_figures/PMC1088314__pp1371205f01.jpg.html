This signaling pathway has been defined through genetics in the model legumes M. truncatula and L. japonicus, and Medicago sativa. The genes identified are defined in boxes. Mutations in all these genes have been characterized for calcium spiking except SYMRK. In addition, it has been shown that mutations in NFR5 and NFR1 lack the calcium flux, whereas mutations in DMI1 and DMI2 show the first phase of the flux response. Components of the Nod factor (NF) signaling pathway are conserved with mycorrhizal signaling. We presume that genes specific to mycorrhizae must exist at equivalent positions to NFR1 and NFR5 and possibly NSP1 and NSP2.</div></div>
