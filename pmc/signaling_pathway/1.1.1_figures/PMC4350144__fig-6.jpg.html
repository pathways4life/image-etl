From: Retinoic Acid Modulates Interferon-γ Production by Hepatic Natural Killer T Cells via Phosphatase 2A and the Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of modulating effect of RA on IFN-γ production by NKT cells via the PP2A-ERK pathway. The activity of MEKs (also known as MAPKKs) in the NKT cells was induced by the signaling cascade triggered via TCR and CD28, which promotes ERK phosphorylation and IFN-γ expression (solid arrow). RA increased the PP2A activity to de-phosphorylate p-ERK and, subsequently, reduced the IFN-γ expression (dot arrow).</div></div>
