(<b>A</b>) Nkd1 and Axin1 cooperate to inhibit TOPflash. HEK293T cells were transfected with TOPflash, the indicated amount of 3XFlag-Nkd1 and 20 nM control or Axin1-targeting siRNA. Cells were treated overnight with or without Wnt3A and TOPflash activity was measured by luciferase assay. Data are shown as the mean of three samples (left panel) or percentage of control (right panel) Â±standard deviation. (<b>B</b>) Model of inhibition of Wnt3A signaling by Nkd1 and Axin1 cooperation.</div></div>
