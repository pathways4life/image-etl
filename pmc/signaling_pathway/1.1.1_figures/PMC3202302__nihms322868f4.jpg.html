Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the immunoreceoptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs) of the cytoplasmic tails of BCR-associated Igα and Igβ chains initiates BCR-proximal signaling and the formation of an active signalosome. Phosphorylation of ITAM tyrosines by Src family kinases leads to the recruitment and activation of the kinase Syk and the Tec family kinase BTK, as well as phosphorylation and recruitment of the adaptor BLNK and the lipase PLCγ2. The assembly of an active BCR-proximal signaling complex ultimately leads to activation of MAPKs (not pictured) and canonical NFκB signaling via PKCβ and the CARMA1-MALT1-BCL10 complex which functions to activate IKK1/IKK2. Activation of the IKK1-IKK2-NEMO complex results in phosphorylation of IκBα, marking it for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation. Activation of canonical NFκB signaling by the BCR leads to induction of transcription of p100, BAFF-R, and cRel (among others), which are critical for BAFF-R signaling. The CD19 coreceptor molecule promotes activation of the PI3K pathway leading to activation of AKT. AKT activation promotes B-cell survival and metabolism through the inhibition of FOXO1, upregulation of MCL-1 and inhibition of BIM, as well as activation of the mTORC1 complex. BAFF-R signaling also activates PI3K (via an unknown mechanism), as well as non-canonical NFκB signaling. Following BAFF engagement of the BAFF-R, TRAF2 and TRAF3 are recruited leading to the release of NIK, which phosphorylates IKK1 leading to p100 processing to p52 and activation of non-canonical NFκB.</div></div>
