From: Negative regulation of cytokine <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> and immune responses by SOCS proteins. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signaling by suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1). LPS stimulates NF-κB and the JNK/p38 pathway through Toll-like receptor (TLR)4/MD2 receptor. IFN-β is rapidly induced through the TRIF/IRF-3 pathway and activates the JAK/STAT1 (Janus kinase/signal transduction and activators of transcription 1) pathway. SOCS1 is probably induced by STAT1 and NF-κB, and then suppresses both STAT1 and NF-κB. One possible mechanism of NF-κB suppression is the induction of degradation of the p65 NF-κB subunit.</div></div>
