From:  KEGGViewer, a BioJS component to visualize KEGG Pathways. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">( <b>a</b>) KEGGViewer rendering of the insulin signaling pathway. Pathway components can be manually repositioned. Genes and pathways are represented as green and blue boxes respectively while purple dots represent chemical compounds. Relationships represent reactions e.g. activation, inhibtion or phosphorilation. ( <b>b</b>) Zoomed view of the insulin signaling pathway. Condition 1 is selected in the control panel (top right) and the expression range is set to consider expression levels between -0.43 and 0.43 to be non differentially expressed. Genes PPP1CA and PYGB in red are upregulated while GYS1 in blue is downregulated. GSK3B and CALML6 in green are non differentially expressed genes. The purple dot C00369 represents Starch.</div></div>
