Total cell protein was extracted and the expression of Cdc42, phosphorylated-ERK1/2, C-myc and p27 was detected by Western blotting. (B) OPCs were cultured in medium containing 1 % FBS, in the absence (N1) and presence of 30 ng/ml of recombinant human Wnt3a for 3 days. After culture, total protein was extracted and the expression of RAC/Cdc42/PAKs pathway proteins were detected by Western blotting. (C) Schematic representation of signaling relationships between gene products found regulated by Sox17 siRNA, either at the RNA or protein levels. Upregulated gene products are represented in red, and downregulated products in blue. Solid arrows indicate stimulation, while bars indicate repression of activity.</div></div>
