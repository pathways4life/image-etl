IPA software was used to map common miR-7-downregulated genes (shown in green) in FaDu and HN5 cells onto the canonical PI3K/Akt pathway. The density of shading represents the fold-change downregulation of a gene by miR-7. Blue circles indicate that a gene is a predicted or validated target of miR-7 by IPA analysis. Several genes belonging to the PI3K/Akt pathway that were downregulated by miR-7 in HN5 cells only are shaded in light blue.</div></div>
