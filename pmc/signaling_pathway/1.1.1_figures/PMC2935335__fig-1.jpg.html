Shown are the major elements in the two pathways. RTK, activated by growth factors, RET/PTC, and Ras can be coupled to both pathways. The remaining components regulate their respective pathways as described in the text. PTEN is a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway signaling. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.</div></div>
