The cells were treated with WHW extract at concentrations of 500 and 1000 μg/mL for 9 days. The expression of JNK, IRS-1, or PI3K was measured by western blot analysis. Relative density was calculated as the ratio of p-JNK expression to JNK, p-IRS-1 expression to IRS-1 expression, or PI3K expression to actin expression, respectively. Con: differentiated adipocytes as a control; Tu: 2 μg/mL tunicamycin; 500: 2 μg/mL tunicamycin + WHW 500 μg/mL; 1000: 2 μg/mL tunicamycin + WHW 1000 μg/mL. These data are presented as the mean ± SD (n = 3). *Significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) from tunicamycin treatment.</div></div>
