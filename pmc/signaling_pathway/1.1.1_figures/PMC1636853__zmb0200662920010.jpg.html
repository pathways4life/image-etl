From: Different Routes of Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) Receptor Endocytosis Influence BMP <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>  . </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Smad-dependent signaling and Smad-independent BMP signaling originate from distinct endocytic routes of the BMP receptors. Smad-dependent signaling is initiated upon BMP-2 binding to PFCs, which exist in an inactive state at the cell surface prior to ligand binding (45). Activation of this signaling cascade by BMP-2 binding results in the phosphorylation of Smad1/5 by the type I receptor. This step in Smad signaling occurs while the receptors reside at the plasma membrane; inhibition of endocytosis (treatment with chlorpromazine or expression of dominant negative dynamin) does not affect BMP-2-mediated Smad phosphorylation. Subsequent endocytosis of the receptors through CCPs, however, is needed to transmit the Smad signal into the nucleus to control the transcriptional activity of target genes. Treatment with lovastatin to perturb cholesterol-dependent plasma membrane regions does not affect Smad signaling but reduces BMP-2-mediated ALP induction through a Smad-independent cascade. This signaling pathway is initiated by the binding of BMP-2 to high-affinity BRI, and a subsequent recruitment of BRII into the signaling receptor complex BISC occurs (45). From the data presented here, we conclude that Smad-independent signaling resulting in ALP induction starts from receptors (BISCs) residing in cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane regions.</div></div>
