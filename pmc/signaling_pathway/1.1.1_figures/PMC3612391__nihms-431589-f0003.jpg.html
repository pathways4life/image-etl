Diverse functions of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> in wiring the nervous system.  From: The role and mechanism-of-action of Sema3E and Plexin-D1 in vascular and neural development. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>(A)</b> Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling promotes or inhibits axonal growth depending on its association with other transmembrane proteins. In cortical neurons, Sema3E acts as a classical repulsive cue and inhibits neuronal growth solely through the Plexin-D1 receptor (Left) [21]. However, Sema3E plays as a positive regulator in the subiculo-mammillary neurons where Plexin-D1 forms complex with co-receptors, neuropilin-1 and VEGF receptor (Right) [21, 22]. <b>(B)</b> Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling determines different type of synapse specificity and formation depending on ligand receptor localization on pre- vs. post-synaptic neurons. Two different cases of synaptic recognition regulation by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling have been reported. (B-i) Postsynaptic target releases Sema3E to control synapse specificity in spinal cord motor neuron circuitry [23]. In the spinal cord, incoming cutaneous maximus (CM) sensory neurons express Plexin-D1 and target CM motor neurons express repulsive cue, Sema3E, thus there is no monosynaptic CM sensory-motor connections. On the other hand, absence of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling produces abnormal CM sensory-motor circuit. (B-ii) Incoming presynaptic neurons express Sema3E to control synapse specificity in pathway specific thalamostriatal circuitry [20]. In contrast to sensory-motor circuit in the spinal cord, Sema3E is expressed in incoming thalamic neurons in thalamostriatal projections whereas Plexin-D1 is expressed specifically in Drd1-positive direct pathway MSNs. Lack of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling causes ectopic thalamostriatal synapse in direct pathway MSNs.</div></div>
