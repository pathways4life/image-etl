From: Neuronal Polarity. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Coordination of extracellular and intracellular signaling regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and axon formation. Overview of selected signaling pathways that may initiate neuronal polarization and axon specification. BDNF signaling (blue) leads to activation of PKA/LKB1/SAD A/B signaling that regulates the stability of microtubules and induces axon formation. The PI3K/PIP3/Akt/GSK-3Î² pathway (purple) regulates MAPs and the stability of microtubules. Another signaling branch activates Rap1B and the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1. Signals from both of these GTPases regulate actin dynamics via WASP/WAVE (red) or PAK-cofilin pathways (green). Rac1 may also regulate microtubules by regulating the microtubule destabilizer Op18/Stathmin. Apart from being downstream of PI3K signaling, Cdc42 and Rac1 may be activated by other signals (potential green and red plasma membrane [PM] receptors). Another molecule implicated in axon development is RhoA, which might regulate actin via the LIMK/cofilin pathway (green) or microtubule dynamics via ROCK signaling to MAPs (orange).</div></div>
