From: Mathematical modeling elucidates the role of transcriptional feedback in gibberellin <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span>. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The gibberellin signaling network is composed of three modules. Perception: gibberellin (GA4) binds to the GID1 receptor, and this complex binds to DELLA proteins. The GA4â€“GID1 complex then mediates the ubiquitination (indicated by Ub) of the DELLA proteins. Response: DELLA proteins mediate transcriptional activation of the GID1, GA20ox, and GA3ox genes and the repression of DELLA transcription. Biosynthesis: the enzyme GA20ox converts GA12 to GA15, then to GA24, and finally, to GA9, which is subsequently converted to GA4 by the enzyme GA3ox. Thus, activation of this pathway stimulates formation of GA4 (provided that sufficient GA12 is available).</div></div>
