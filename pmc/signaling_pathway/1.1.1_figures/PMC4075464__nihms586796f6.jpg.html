Schematic presentation of relations between Rho and p38 MAPK <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> leading to barrier dysfunction in human lung microvascular and macrovascular endothelium.

In HPAEC, LTA/PepG-induced p38 MAPK activation is attenuated by inhibition of Rho kinase, while activation of Rho kinase is not affected by inhibition of p38 MAPK. In contrast, the Rho - p38 MAPK crosstalk in microvascular EC is bi-directional, as inhibition of either pathway affected its counterpart. Finally, both Rho and p38 MAPK pathways modulate LTA/PepG-induced activation of NFκB pathway.</div></div>
