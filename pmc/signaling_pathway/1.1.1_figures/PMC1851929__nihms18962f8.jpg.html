(a) Interaction between the viral S protein and MHV receptor (MHVR). (b) Fusion between viral envelope and cell membrane. (c) Integration of viral envelope proteins (E, M, S, S2) into the cell membrane after fusion. (d) Activation of the Fas signal pathway by virus–cell fusion and the post-fusion complexes. This is likely the major pathway leading to activation of the caspase-8 and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. (e) An alternative pathway of the activation of the Fas signaling. Solid lines with arrows indicate the steps (pathways) that are supported by experimental data, whereas dashed lines with arrows denote the hypothetic pathways with little or no experimental data. The following blocking reagents were used in the experiments to establish the individual steps of the pathways: the CC1 (anti-MHVR antibody), αS (anti-S protein antibody), Fas/Fc (chimeric soluble receptor), C8IN (caspase-8 inhibitor), C9IN (caspase-9 inhibitor) and Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL.</div></div>
