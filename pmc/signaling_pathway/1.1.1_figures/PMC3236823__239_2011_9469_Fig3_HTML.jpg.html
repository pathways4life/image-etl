Species indication: Hs Homo sapiens, Sc S. cerevisiae, Sp S. pombe, At A. thaliana. <b>b</b> Reconstruction of TOR signaling in the animal ancestor. An AGC kinase duplicated in the ancestor of animals and choanoflagellates to give rise to PKB and SGK. SGK lost the ability to inhibit TSC2. New signaling inputs were invented in the animal ancestor, among which is the insulin signaling. <b>c</b> TOR signaling in the ancestor of animals and fungi. An AGC kinase duplicated in the ancestor of animals and fungi (Opisthokont ancestor) that give rise to S6K and RSK. The duplication was followed by subsequent sub-functionalization of ancestral functions between the two paralogs. <b>d</b> TOR signaling in LECA. The duplication of the ancestral AGC kinase that give rise to the RSK-S6K and PKB-SGK ancestral precursor genes corresponds to the differential activation by either TORC1 or TORC2, respectively. <b>e</b> Reconstruction of pre-LECA TOR signaling. The shared subunits TOR and LST8 of both TOR complexes suggest that before LECA there was at one point only one proto-TOR complex. As the AGC kinases also share single ancestry we can reduce the complexity of the TOR pathway in pre-LECA even further</div></div>
