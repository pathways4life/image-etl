(<b>a</b>) Representative photomicrographs of immunohistochemistry (IHC) detecting TCTP and p-MLC in the aorta from wild-type (WT) and TCTP-TG mice. Immunostaining of aortas from WT and TCTP-TG were performed with antibodies detecting TCTP and phosphorylated MLC (p-MLC). Nuclei were counterstained blue with hematoxylin reagent (N = 3); (<b>b</b>) Western blot analysis of aortic tissues was done as described in Materials and Methods using anti-TCTP, -RhoA, -p-MLC, -MLC, and -Î²-actin-specific antibodies.</div></div>
