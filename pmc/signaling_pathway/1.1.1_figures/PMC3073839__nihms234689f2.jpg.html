Reporter assays were conducted in 3T3 cells (left and middle panels) or in Dmp1−/− cells (right panel). The baseline (without HER2 expression vector) was set at 1.0. B, binding of endogenous Dmp1 to the Arf promoter in four different MMTV-neu tumors. Tissue ChIP was conducted with formalin-fixed tumors from wild-type MMTV-neu mice. The Dmp1 protein was detectable on the Arf promoter with two different antibodies to Dmp1 (RAX for T1 and T2, and RAD for T3 and T4). C, proposed signaling pathway that links HER2/neu overexpression and p53 activation. Activation of the Dmp1 promoter is mediated by PI3K-Akt-NF-κB signaling, and induction of Arf by HER2/neu is dependent on Dmp1. This diverts toxic hyperproliferative signaling from HER2/neu to a p53-dependent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.</div></div>
