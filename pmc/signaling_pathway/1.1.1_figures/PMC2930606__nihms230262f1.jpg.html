In particular, the cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32 pathway modulates the activity of MAPK-dependent signaling pathways downstream of glutamate receptors. It has been recently recognized that cAMP-independent pathways are also recruited following D2 receptor stimulation (non-canonical pathways; cf. Section ‘DA receptor signaling in the neurons of the intact striatum: modulation of cAMP/PKA pathways and non-canonical signaling’). Full names of the molecules shown in this drawing are given in the list of abbreviations.</div></div>
