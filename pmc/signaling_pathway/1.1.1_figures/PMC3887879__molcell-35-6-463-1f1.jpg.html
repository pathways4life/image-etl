The key signaling pathways that regulate mTORC1 and mTORC2 and the composition of each mTOR complex are depicted. Multiple inputs from growth factors, amino acids, cellular energy status, and stress are integrated into mTORC1 through the mechanisms shown. When mTORC1 is active, it plays a major role in promoting cell growth and proliferation by stimulating various anabolic processes such as protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, and by inhibiting catabolic processes such as autophagy. mTORC2 is regulated by growth factors through a poorly identified mechanism, but unlike mTORC1, it does not respond to other upstream signals derived from nutrients or stress.</div></div>
