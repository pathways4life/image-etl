MICL is known to inhibit cytokine transcription instigated by other receptors as a method of control. On the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that MICL induces activatory pathways through MAPK, which is somewhat contradictory to the known functions of its motif. Downstream signaling of MAH is largely unknown. Dashed arrows represent a pathway that has yet to be fully defined.</div></div>
