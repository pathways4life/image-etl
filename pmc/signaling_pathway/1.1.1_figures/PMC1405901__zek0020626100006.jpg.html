We propose that the A. nidulans PhLP PhnA is an essential component of SfaD-GpgA-mediated signaling, which is required for normal vegetative growth, sexual fruiting body formation, ST production, and proper down-regulation of asexual development. FadA-mediated vegetative growth signaling is transduced in part by the primary PKA PkaA (34). PkaB is the secondary (backup) PKA catalytic subunit, playing a role in hyphal growth and germination (25). The FadA→PkaA signaling pathway is thought to be primarily responsible for the negative control of ST biosynthesis via modulating the activity of the AflR protein (35). The potential inhibitory role of the FadA→PkaA pathway on the transcription of aflR is indicated by a dotted line (34, 35). It is proposed that the results of SfaD-GpgA signaling include transcriptional activation of aflR and subsequent ST production. A dotted arrow presents the predicted posttranscriptional/posttranslational activation of AflR by FlbA. Potential autoactivation of aflR transcription by the AflR protein (10, 35) is also indicated.</div></div>
