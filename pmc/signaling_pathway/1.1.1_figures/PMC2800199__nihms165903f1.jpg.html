Activation of ERK leads to induction of CDK4/cyclin D activity and Rb phosphorylation. Raf-1 also binds and phosphorylates Rb leading to dissociation of E2F, and expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, angiogenesis and tumor growth. Treatment with RRD-251 disrupts RB-Raf-1 interaction and prevents Rb phosphorylation and inhibits E2F-mediated transcription of S-phase genes.</div></div>
