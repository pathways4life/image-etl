Both Jagged1 mRNA level (left panel) and protein level (right panel) decreased after RBP-jκ knockdown in OVCAR3 cells as detected by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. B. Cell proliferation significantly decreases in OVCAR3 cells following RBP-jκ knockdown. RBP-jκ shRNA1 and shRNA was co-applied in this study. C. mRNA expression level of Notch3 is not altered by Jagged1 shRNA knockdown in OVCAR3 cells</div></div>
