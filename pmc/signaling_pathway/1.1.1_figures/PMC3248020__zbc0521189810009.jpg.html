The β-catenin/TCF4 pathway may in turn down-regulate the expression of downstream targets such as cyclin D1 and c-myc in S100A7-overexpressing ERα+ cells. Therefore, the β-catenin/TCF4 pathway may be responsible for decreased proliferation and tumor growth in S100A7-overexpressing cells. In addition, S100A7 may modulate migration through enhanced co-localization and interaction of β-catenin and E-cadherin in the membranes of ERα+ cells.</div></div>
