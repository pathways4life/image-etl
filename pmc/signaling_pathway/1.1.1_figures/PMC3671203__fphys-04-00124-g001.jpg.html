In living cells, these modules contribute to activity of the pathways upstream signaling, here represented by a pathway upstream module. Functionally, the pathway upstream module of a given pathway activates or inhibits the activity of distinct downstream modules, here exemplified for activation of a MAPK and a PI3K/AKT module. These modules themselves consist of associated genes, e.g., encoding for ERK, RAS, or RAF isoforms in case of MAPK signaling or PI3K catalytic and regulatory isoforms as well as AKT, PTEN, and others. In our network, these downstream modules are again linked to events acting further downstream in the pathway, like activation of an AP1 or MYC transcription factor module.</div></div>
