(A) A cell responding to a typical polypeptide morphogen (purple ovals). Green dashed arrows point to extracellular inhibitory factors induced by the signal. Red lines denote intracellular mechanisms of repression. (B) An RA-producing cell showing the biosynthetic pathway for RA. Retinyl esters and beta-carotene are important stores of RA precursor. Green dashed arrows point to components of the pathway induced by RA signaling. Red lines denote repression of adhs and aldh1as by RA. (C) Polypeptide morphogens typically induce their own receptors, which are subsequently degraded through receptor-mediated endocytosis. (D) An RA-responding cell showing signaling and catabolism. RA (red circles) enters cells and binds Crabps (blue crescents), which transport it either to RARs (blue and green ovals) in the nucleus (orange) for signaling or to Cyp26s (black hexagons) for degradation. Adhs, alcohol dehydrogenases; aldh1as, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1as.</div></div>
