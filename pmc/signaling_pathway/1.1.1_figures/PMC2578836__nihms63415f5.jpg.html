(A) OT reporter assays were performed in MDA-MB468 cells transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors. Different amount of Smad2 expression vector (100, 500 ng/well) were used. (B) OT reporter assay was performed in 293T cells transiently transfected with the indicated expression vectors. Error bars indicate standard deviations of triplicate experiments.</div></div>
