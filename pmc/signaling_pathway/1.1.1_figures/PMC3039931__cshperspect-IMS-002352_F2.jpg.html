The central role of the CARD9/Malt1/Bcl10 complex in activating primarily the NF-κB pathway and to a lesser extent the MAPK pathway is shown (see Colonna 2007). Engagement of C-type lectin receptors, leading to Syk activation, is coupled to the CARD9 complex through an unclear pathway, but may involve PKCs. This in turn directly leads to activation of IKK, which in turn activates downstream NF-κB pathways (see Hara and Saito 2009). The importance of this pathway in innate immune cell recognition has been revealed by the similar defect in host defense in mice lacking either the C-type lectin receptors, Syk, or CARD9 (Gross et al. 2006). The CARD9 complex may also facilitate the ability of the TLRs to engage downstream MAPK pathway activation. Upstream of the TLRs, the major cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase involved in this innate immune receptor function is Tec-family members, as revealed by poor TLR signaling function in cells derived from either mice or humans lacking various Tec kinases. It remains unclear how the Tec kinases operate in the TLR pathway, but could involve phosphorylation of signaling adapters MyD88 or Mal.</div></div>
