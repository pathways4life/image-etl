(A) Genes of the mitochondrial dysfunction pathway interacting with PM10 and packyears exposure between surveys on FEV1/FVC decline. (B) Genes of the methane metabolism pathway interacting with PM10 and packyears exposure between surveys on FEF25â€“75 decline. (C) Genes of the apoptosis signaling pathway interacting with PM10 and packyears exposure between surveys on FEV1 decline.</div></div>
