From: Dioxins: diagnostic and prognostic challenges arising from complex mechanisms. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The AHR signaling pathway. Dioxins or endogenous ligands bind to the AHR in the cytosol, where it is translocated to the nucleus and dimerizes with the ARNT and directs transcription from dioxin response elements (DREs). Alternatively, dioxin signaling can be mediated through a ‘non-genomic’ pathway. This pathway is initiated by ligand activated AHR, but lacks the requirement for nuclear translocation or ARNT. In this pathway, TCDD exposure can increase intracellular Ca2+ elevations through an undefined mechanism.</div></div>
