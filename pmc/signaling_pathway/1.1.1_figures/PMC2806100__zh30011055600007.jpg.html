A: 2 pathways mediate apoptosis in pancreatitis. The mitochondrial pathway is initiated by cytochrome c release followed by caspase activation (3). The p53-mediated pathway also stimulates activation of caspases. Inflammatory cells inhibit the p53-mediated pathway but do not affect the mitochondrial pathway. B: detailed scheme of the p53-mediated pathway. Inflammatory cells inhibit this pathway through upregulating Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53.</div></div>
