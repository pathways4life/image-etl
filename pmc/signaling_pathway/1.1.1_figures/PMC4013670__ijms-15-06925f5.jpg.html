The effect of resveratrol on (<b>a</b>) MyD88 and (<b>b</b>) TRAF6 mRNA and protein expression was assessed in serum-starved (0.5% FCS) articular chondrocytes treated with 10 ng/mL IL-1β for 1 h before being treated with either 12.5 or 100 μM resveratrol for 24 h. The relative expression levels of MyD88 and TRAF6 mRNA were determined by real-time RT-PCR. p &lt; 0.05, * vs. control, # vs. IL-1β. After incubation of chondrocytes in the presence or absence of resveratrol as described above, the relative amount of MyD88 and TRAF6 were determined by western blot analysis.</div></div>
