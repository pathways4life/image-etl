Western blot assay was performed to analyze NF-κB signaling pathway activation (a). The ratio of densitometry values of phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) and IKK (p-IKK) compared with total p65 and IKK, respectively, was analyzed and normalized to each control cultures (b). Results were expressed as a percentage of the control cultures and were the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. #P &lt; 0.05 compared with the control cultures; *P &lt; 0.05 compared with LPS-treated cultures.</div></div>
