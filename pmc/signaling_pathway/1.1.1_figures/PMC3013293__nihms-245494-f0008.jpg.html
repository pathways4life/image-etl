CMF binds to its receptor, and inhibits PldB. This could be through the known CMF pathway involving Gα1βγ, and PLC, or through an as yet unidentified pathway. Decreased PldB activity decreases phosphatidic acid production and increases the dissociation between Gα2 and G βγ, most likely through inhibiting the Gα2 GTPase activity. This allows cAMP signaling and thus aggregation to occur.</div></div>
