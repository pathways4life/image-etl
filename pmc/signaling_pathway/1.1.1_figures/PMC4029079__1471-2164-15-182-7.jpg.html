(A)</b> Common DEGs in all the three pathways. <b>(B)</b> Common DEGs in “pathways in cancer” and “insulin signaling pathway”. <b>(C)</b> A common DEG in “pathways in cancer” and “MAPK signaling pathway”. <b>(D)</b> DEGs only in “pathways in cancer”. <b>(E)</b> DEGs only in “insulin signaling pathway”. <b>(F)</b> DEGs only in “MAPK signaling pathway”. Small-molecule chemical inhibitors of the Ras downstream effectors (Rafi, Raf inhibitor; LY294002, PI3K inhibitor; Rapa, rapamycin, TORC1 inhibitor; 15 μg/larva) are injected into Ras1CA-overexpressed silkworm larvae. Inhibitors are marked with different color: black, DMSO as a control; red: Raf inhibitor; green, LY294002; blue: rapamycin.</div></div>
