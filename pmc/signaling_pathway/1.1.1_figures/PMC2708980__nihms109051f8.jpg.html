Proposed signaling pathway that links protein kinase C (PKC) and RasGRP1/3 to apoptosis in Toledo B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma (B-NHL) cells. Single-headed arrows denote positive regulatory influences while double-headed arrows denote reciprocal regulatory effects and physical associations between Bcl-2 family members. Points of action of the Mek inhibitor (U0126) and the pan-PKC inhibitor (Bis) are indicated.</div></div>
