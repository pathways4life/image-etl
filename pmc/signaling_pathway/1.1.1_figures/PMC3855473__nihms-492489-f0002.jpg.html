From: NF-?B as a target for oncogenic viruses. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Tax-specific noncanonical NF-κB pathway. Noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway is stimulated in B cells by the BAFFR and CD40 signals. This pathway is negatively regulated by TRAF3, which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 via TRAF2 and induces ubiquitin-dependent degradation of NIK. The receptor signals induce degradation of TRAF3 and TRAF2, leading to accumulation of NIK and NIK/IKKα-mediated p100 C-termimal phosphorylation. The phosphorylated p100 is then processed through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and produce the mature NF-κB2 p52 as a dimer with RelB. Under normal conditions, active processing of p100 does not occur in T cells. However, in HTLV1 infected T cells, Tax initiates an active noncanonical NF-κB pathway by bridging p100 and IKKα. In contrast to the cellular pathway, which is independent of NEMO, the viral pathway requires NEMO, which may function as an adaptor for Tax/IKKα association.</div></div>
