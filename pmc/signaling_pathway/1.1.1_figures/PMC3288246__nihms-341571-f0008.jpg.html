From: ERK/GSK3ss/Snail <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> mediates radiation-induced alveolar epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism for radiation-induced EMT in alveolar type II epithelial cells. Radiation-induced generation of ROS leads to activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Activated ERK1/2 causes the inactivation of GSK3ß by phosphorylation of the serine 9 active site, which leads to the disassociation of Snail from GSK3ß. Snail then translocates to the nucleus where it functions as a repressor of E-cadherin and initiate EMT in AE2 cells.</div></div>
