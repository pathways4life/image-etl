Molecular mechanisms by which osteogenic oxysterols induce osteogenic differentiation of marrow stromal cells.

Activation of these pathways mediate osteogenic differentiation of MSC and cooperatively or distinctly regulate the markers and genes associated with osteogenic differentiation and Wnt signaling including alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin (OCN) mRNA expression, Wif-1 and Nkd2 expression, and matrix mineralization.</div></div>
