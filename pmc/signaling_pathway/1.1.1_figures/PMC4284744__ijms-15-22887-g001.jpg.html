Interaction of LRP-1 and its ligands mediates fibroblast differentiation and transdifferentiation. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) binds to LRP-1 and induces its tyrosine phosphorylation, followed by activation of: (1) extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk)1/2 pathway to stimulate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 production and trigger the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT); (2) p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK) and Bad pathway to promote fibroblast survival; (3) p90RSK and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3β pathway to induce proliferation; (4) TGF-β1-mediated β1 integrin and integrin-linked kinase (ILK) pathway to induce myofibroblast activation. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) binds and induces LRP-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and promotes TGF-β1-mediated Erk1/2 activation, which leads to synergistic activation of myofibroblasts.
