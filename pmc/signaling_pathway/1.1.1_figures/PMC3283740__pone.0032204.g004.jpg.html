Active, matrix-bound PAI-1 blocks the association of Integrin and uPAR with the extracellular matrix and subsequently supports cell blebbing by activating the RhoA pathway. If only matrix-bound PAI-1 is available, as in our experimental model, the RhoA pathway is activated either through biomechanical transmission (implicating an unknown co-actor) or transduction (implicating a transmembrane receptor; altogether these events might lead to amoeboid migration.</div></div>
