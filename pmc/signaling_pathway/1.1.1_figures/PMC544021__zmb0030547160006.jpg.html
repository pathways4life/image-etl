(A) Paxillin suppresses LIMK1-induced SRF transcriptional activity in Cos7 cells. (B) Paxillin−/− cells exhibit approximately twofold-increased SRF transcriptional activity compared with rescued cells. (C) Paxillin−/− cells exhibit decreased Rac activity, as measured in pulldown assays with GST-PAK (PBD). The lower panel shows levels of rac in total cell lysate (TCL). (D) Paxillin−/− cells have increased Rho activity. The lower panel shows that levels of rho in different lysates are similar.</div></div>
