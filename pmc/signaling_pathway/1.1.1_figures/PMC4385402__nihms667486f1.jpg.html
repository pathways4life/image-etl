From: Multiple Drug Resistance-Associated Protein 4 (MRP4), Prostaglandin Transporter (PGT), and 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) as Determinants of PGE2 Levels in Cancer. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme is the rate-limiting step in the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from arachidonic acid. PGE2 is exported from the cell via multiple drug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4). In an autocrine or paracrine manner, extracellular PGE2 binds any of its four cognate EP receptors, EP1-4, and initiates diverse signaling pathways via activation of G-proteins. Alternatively, PGE2 is imported via the prostaglandin transporter (PGT) and inactivated by 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH). The bold arrows indicate members of this pathway up-regulated in cancer while the dotted arrows indicate members of this pathway down-regulated in cancer.</div></div>
