From: Amplification of dopaminergic <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> by a positive  feedback loop. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model illustrating the regulation of dopamine signaling by  Cdk5/phospho-Thr-75 DARPP-32 and regulation of the  Cdk5/phospho-Thr-75 DARPP-32 pathway by dopamine. The Cdk5 signaling  and PKA signaling pathways, through a positive feedback loop, are  mutually antagonistic. (Left) Under basal conditions,  phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr-75 by Cdk5 causes, successively,  inhibition of PKA, inactivation of PP-2A, and decreased  dephosphorylation of phospho-Thr-75 DARPP-32. Inhibition of PKA also  results in decreased phosphorylation of DARPP-32-Thr-34 and, therefore,  in activation of PP-1. Inhibition of PKA and activation of PP-1  synergistically reduce the phosphorylation of various substrates.  (Right) Dopamine, by sequentially activating dopamine D1  receptors, PKA and PP-2A, reduces the level of phospho-Thr-75 DARPP-32.  Dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr-75 by PP-2A removes the inhibition  of PKA. Activation of PKA also results in increased phosphorylation of  DARPP-32-Thr-34 and in inhibition of PP-1. Activation of PKA and  inhibition of PP-1 synergistically increase the phosphorylation of  various substrates.</div></div>
