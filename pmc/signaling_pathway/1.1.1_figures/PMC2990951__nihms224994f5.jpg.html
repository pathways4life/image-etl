Cultures were co-transfected with a luciferase construct under the SV-40 promoter and Pr22. Transiently transfected cells were left untreated or were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of TGF-β2 or IL-1β alone or in combinations with or without various intracellular signaling pathway inhibitors for 24 hours. Promoter activities were analyzed by dividing β–Gal activity by luciferase activity. Intracellular signaling pathway inhibitors (A) SB202190(20μM), (B) JSH-23 (30μM), (C) SP600125(30μM), (D) SIS-3(10μM), and (E) PD98059(40μM) were used. Each value is the mean of results obtained from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Error bars indicate standard deviation. * indicates a p-value of less than 0.05. ** indicates a p-value of less than 0.005.</div></div>
