From: What's new in FGF23 research?. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">FGF23 binds to Klotho–FGF receptor complex and activates mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in kidney and parathyroid glands (left). Several methods have been reported as potential new therapy for FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. C-terminal fragment of FGF23 competes with full-length FGF23 for binding to the Klotho–FGF receptor complex (A). The inhibition of FGF receptor (B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (C) can inhibit FGF23 signaling. Anti-FGF23 antibodies also antagonize actions of FGF23 (D).</div></div>
