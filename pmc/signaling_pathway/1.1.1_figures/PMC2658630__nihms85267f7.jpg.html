Results presented here have demonstrated that both Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling is mediated by a Gi-dependent pathway while Rho signaling occurs through an alternate G-protein, possibly G12/13 or Gq as has been shown in previous studies (5–9). In addition, Gi-dependent activation of Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt occur through independent pathways and are unaffected by inhibition of Rho signaling. These results are further supported by the finding that anastellin suppresses Ras activation by LPA and prevents ERK activation without affecting PI3K/Akt or Rho/ROCK signaling. The dashed line linking S1P receptors to G12/13 indicates that a weak induction by S1P was observed in MVECs.</div></div>
