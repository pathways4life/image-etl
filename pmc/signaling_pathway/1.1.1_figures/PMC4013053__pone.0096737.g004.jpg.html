Compounds included the three selective NOD1 pathway inhibitors or previously identified inhibitors of NOD2 signaling (GSK669 and GSK400). Levels of total IκBα, as well as total and phosphorylated MAPKs (p38, JNK and ERK1/2) were determined by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates. A RIP2 inhibitor was used as a positive control with 293/hNOD2 cells in which the NOD1 pathway inhibitors had no effect on MDP responses. Results shown are representative of two separate experiments performed in both cell lines.</div></div>
