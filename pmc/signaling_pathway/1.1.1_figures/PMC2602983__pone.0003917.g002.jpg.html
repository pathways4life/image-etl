TOPFLASH/FOPflash reporter analysis (D) confirms that Wnt pathway activity in HB1.F3 is significantly higher than that in F3.Olig2. The reporter activity in HB1.F3 was inhibited to the level of F3.Olig2 when HB1.F3 was co-transfected with ‘dominant negative’ (DN) TCF constructs. Data are means±S.D. of triplicate samples.
