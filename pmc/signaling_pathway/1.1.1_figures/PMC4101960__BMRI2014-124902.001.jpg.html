Ras activation was evaluated as Ras GTP by ELISA (a). Phosphorylated (p)-ERK1/2 and p-Akt protein expression were evaluated as the ratio p/total protein by Western blot ((b) and (c), resp.). Bars represent the mean ± SEM of the optical density measured in kidney samples of control saline group (Ctrl; n = 3) and angiotensin II-treated animals (Ang II, 0.8 mg/kg; n = 3–5/per time point). *P &lt; 0.05 versus control group.</div></div>
