ST2L heterodimerizes with MyD88, thereby preventing the engagement of adapter protein MyD88 into the post-receptor signaling complexes (TLR2/1-MyD88 tetramer and TLR2/6-MyD88 tetramer) and thus exhibiting its inhibitory effect. Full-length structures of TLR2, 1 and 6 are colored in sky blue, tan and light green, respectively. The TIR domains of ST2L and MyD88 are colored in hot pink and gold, respectively. The available TLR2/1 and TLR2/6 ECD structure coordinates along with their respective ligands were taken from the PDB (2Z80 and 3A79). The red color dotted line along with the bar represents inhibition symbol.</div></div>
