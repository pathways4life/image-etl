In contrast, removal of IDRs could be tolerated if the complex is flexible and can adopt a wide ensemble of conformations (right). (B) Schematic representation of the IDR deletion variants. (C) Mating pathway function in yeast strains with IDR-deleted Ste11, Ste20, or Ste50 variants (“Short”), relative to their corresponding full-length variants. (D) Mating pathway function in yeast strains with pairs of simultaneously IDR-deleted variants (either Ste11 and Ste20, or Ste11 and Ste50) in the respective double KO, relative to their corresponding full-length variants. (E) Mating pathway function in yeast strains with IDR-deleted domain rearrangement variants. Statistically significant differences are marked with asterisks. Data shown in Data S1.</div></div>
