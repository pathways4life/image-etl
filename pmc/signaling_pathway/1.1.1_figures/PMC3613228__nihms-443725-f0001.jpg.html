(<b>A</b>) Western blot analysis of Lmna+/+ (n = 7) and Lmna–/– (n = 8) mice heart tissue lysates. Phosphorylated mTOR(S2448), S6 kinase(T389), rpS6(S235/S236), and 4E-BP1(S65) are increased in Lmna–/– mice compared to Lmna+/+ mice. (<b>B</b>) Western blot analysis of Lmna+/+ (n = 7) and Lmna–/– (n = 8) mice skeletal muscle (quadriceps) tissue lysates. Phosphorylated rpS6(S235/S236) and 4E-BP1(S65) are increased in Lmna–/– mice compared to Lmna+/+ mice. However, phosphorylated S6 kinase(T389) is not significantly increased. *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01.</div></div>
