When the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is active, HIV replication is inhibited in astrocytes, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), and monocytes/macrophages. When β-catenin signaling is inactive or suppressed, as occurs when monocytes differentiate into macrophages or astrocytes are exposed to IFNγ, HIV replication is enhanced</div></div>
