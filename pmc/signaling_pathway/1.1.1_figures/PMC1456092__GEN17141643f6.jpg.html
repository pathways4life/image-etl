In the absence of a Wnt ligand, Fz has an intrinsic ability to signal to the PCP pathway. This may occur via a direct interaction with Dsh. When Wg is present, the coreceptor Arr is brought into proximity to Fz, which results in the close apposition of Dsh and Axn. This combination of intracellular components switches the output of Fz from PCP to Arm signaling.</div></div>
