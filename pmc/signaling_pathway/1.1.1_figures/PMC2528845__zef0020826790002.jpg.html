Formation of the FGF-Syndecan/heparin-FGFR complex leads to receptor autophosphorylation and activation of intracellular signaling cascades of the Ras/MAPK pathway, the PI3K/Akt pathway (left), and the PLCγ/Ca2+ /PKC pathway (right) (4,57,90,91). Syndecans facilitate the binding of FGFs to FGFRs, forming a ternary structure. EphA receptors induce tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFRs and FRS2 by forming a complex with the FGFR. The Ras/MAPK signaling cascade is activated by the binding of Grb2 to phosphorylated FRS2. The subsequent formation of the Grb2/SOS complex results in the activation of Ras. There are three routes by which FGFRs are able to activate the PI3K/Akt pathway: Gab1 can bind to FRS2 indirectly via Grb2, resulting in the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (2,96); PI3K can bind directly to a phosphorylated tyrosine residue of the FGFR (88); and lastly, activated Ras can induce membrane localization and activation of the PI3K catalytic subunit (57). The negative feedback signals that are mediated by or imposed on FRS2 are marked by the dotted line (94). The PLCγ/Ca2+ pathway is activated when autophosphorylation on a tyrosine residue in the carboxy terminal tail of the FGFR creates a specific binding site for the SH2 domain of PLCγ (91). The last activated components of the above-mentioned signal transduction cascades translocate into the nucleus and phosphorylate specific transcription factors of the Ets family, which in turn activate expression of FGF target genes.
