A: the mode of miRNAs that regulate apoptosis by modulating the apoptosis-signaling pathway is shown. B: an overview of miRNAs regulating the Wnt signaling pathway. C: miRNAs regulate the inflammation by mediating the Toll-like receptor pathway. D: miRNAs regulate the fibroblast activation and collagen deposition by modulating the TGF-Î² signaling pathway. Downregulated miRNAs are denoted in blue and upregulated in red.</div></div>
