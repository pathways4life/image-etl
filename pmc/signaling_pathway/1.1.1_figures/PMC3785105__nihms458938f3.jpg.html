From: Extended haplotype association study in Crohn's disease identifies a novel, Ashkenazi Jewish-specific missense mutation in the NF-κB <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">pathway</span> gene, HEATR3. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">HEATR3 is a positive component of the NOD2 signaling pathway. siRNA mediated knock down of HEATR3 diminished NOD2-dependent NF-κB induction (A) and IL-8 secretion (B) relative to non-targeting siRNA controls. Furthermore, over-expression of HEATR3 increased NF-κB signaling (C) and IL-8 production (D). Cells were left unstimulated (black bars) or stimulated overnight with 20 ng/mL of MDP (grey bars). Together these results support a positive role for HEATR3 in NOD2 signaling. * P&lt;0.05, ** P&lt;0.01, *** P&lt;0.001.</div></div>
