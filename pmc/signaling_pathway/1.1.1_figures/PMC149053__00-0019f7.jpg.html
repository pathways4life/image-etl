Because this pathway is also regulated by ethylene, mutations in the pathway interfere with both ABA and ethylene signaling.<b>(B)</b> In the presence of ethylene, ABA is unable to use this pathway; thus, mutations that increase ethylene synthesis confer an ABA-insensitive root phenotype.</div></div>
