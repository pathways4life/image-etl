NANOG induces IGF2BP3 and YAP1, which in turn inhibit TGF-β signaling at the level of SMAD3 phosphoactivation and p-SMAD3 nuclear translocation. The former effect is dependent on the IGF2BP3/AKT/mTOR pathway, while the latter is caused by p-YAP1/SMAD7/SMAD3 interactions, which are enhanced by IGF2BP3/AKT–mediated YAP1 phosphorylation. Restoration of the TGF-β tumor suppressor pathway by silencing IGF2BP3 and YAP1 downregulates TLR4 via SMAD3-mediated transcriptional repression and inhibits TLR4/NANOG–mediated TIC self-renewal and oncogenic activity while chemosensitizing TICs. A defective canonical TGF-β pathway, as in Spnb+/– mice, upregulates TLR4 by transcriptional derepression and activates the TLR4/NANOG oncogenic pathway for liver tumorigenesis. </div></div>
