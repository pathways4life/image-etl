Media and total RNA were collected, and the expression of IL-6 was examined by qPCR and ELISA assay (n=4). (C) OASFs were incubated with leptin for the indicated time intervals. Total protein was collected and the phosphorylation of IRS-1 was examined by western blotting assay (n=4). (D) OASFs were transfected with OBRl AS-ODN and MM-ODN for 24 h and then stimulated with leptin (3 µM) for 30 min. Total protein was collected and the phosphorylation of IRS-1 was examined by western blotting (n=4). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. of four independent experiments. *: p &lt; 0.05 as compared with basal level. #: p &lt; 0.05 as compared with the leptin-treated group.</div></div>
