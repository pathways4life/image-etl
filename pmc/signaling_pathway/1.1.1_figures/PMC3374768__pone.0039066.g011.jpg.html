From: Activation of EGFR/ERBB2 via Pathways Involving ERK1/2, P38 MAPK, AKT and FOXO Enhances Recovery of Diabetic Hearts from Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Diabetes and/or hyperglycemia via attenuation of the EGFR/erbB2 signaling and through subsequent modulation of downstream effectors such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK or AKT/FOXO can lead to cardiac dysfunction. The effects of diabetes on EGFR/erbB2 pathway are exacerbated by blockade of this pathway by AG1478 or AG825 which leads to worsening cardiac recovery from I/R. However, the inhibitory effects of diabetes on EGFR/ErbB2 pathway may be opposed by administering EGF that also leads to improved cardiac function. The Angiotensin II (Ang II)/AT1 receptor pathway can also activate EGFR/erbB2 pathway that can be blocked by Losartan. Co-administration of EGF with Losartan attenuates losartan-mediated EGFR blockade and improves cardiac function in diabetes beyond that attained by either drug alone.</div></div>
