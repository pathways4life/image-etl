In the ER lumen, GRP78, in association with P58IPK and other co-chaperones, enhances protein folding and degradation of misfolded proteins (ERAD). Release of GRP78 from PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 induces the UPR signaling. PERK activation leads to eIF2Î± phosphorylation and translation attenuation, contributing to cell survival. In the cytosol, GRP78va enforces PERK signaling by inactivation of the cytosolic P58IPK.</div></div>
