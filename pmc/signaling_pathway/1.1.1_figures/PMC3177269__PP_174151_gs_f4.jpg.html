The common genes identified in A. glutinosa and/or C. glauca were assigned to infection and organogenesis pathways. Black boxes indicate legume genes not yet identified in A. glutinosa or C. glauca. The common pathway between RNS and AM is indicated by the gray box. Adapted from Madsen et al. (2010).</div></div>
