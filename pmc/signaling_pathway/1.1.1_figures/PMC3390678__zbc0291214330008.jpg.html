In normally growing embryos, the Cys-2 residue is oxidized into CysO2(H) or CysO3(H) and subsequently arginylated by ATE1 R-transferases, producing the N-degron Arg, which is recognized by N-recognins containing the UBR box. The degradation of RGS4 through the N-end rule pathway leads to the activation of G-protein signaling and thus cell proliferation. However, if the Cys-2 residue is not readily oxidized, for example in ischemia, RGS4 is accumulated and turns down G-protein signaling. This mechanism may represent a sensor of oxygen or its derivative in the cardiovascular system.</div></div>
