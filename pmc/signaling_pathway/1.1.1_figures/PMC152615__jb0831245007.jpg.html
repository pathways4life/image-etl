From: Signal Detection and Target Gene Induction by the CpxRA Two-Component System. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">CpxRA two-component signal transduction pathway. Components of the Cpx pathway reside in each compartment of the bacterial cell. The Cpx pathway can sense inducing cues that enter the signaling pathway at three distinct points. The mechanism by which growth is sensed remains unclear. X represents the second, as yet unidentified, negative regulator of the Cpx pathway. Note that X could be the periplasmic domain of CpxA. OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane.</div></div>
