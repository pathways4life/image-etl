Upon stimulation of Gαs-coupled GPCR, activation of PKA by cAMP leads to inhibition of Rho GTPases, which indirectly inhibit Lats kinase activity. Stimulation of Gα12/13- or Gαq/11-coupled receptors antagonize the effect of cAMP or PKA on YAP phosphorylation by inducing Rho GTPases. Inhibition of YAP and TAZ mediates functions of cAMP and PKA on adipogenesis, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.</div></div>
