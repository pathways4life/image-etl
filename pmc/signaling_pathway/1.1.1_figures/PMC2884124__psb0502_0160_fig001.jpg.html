Under normal conditions, clade A PP2C constantly interacts with ABA-activated SnRK2 and inactivates its kinase activity by dephosphorylation. When the soluble ABA receptor recognizes the ABA molecule, it binds PP2C and inhibits its phosphatase activity. Then SnRK2 is activated and phosphorylates its targets, and the ABA signal is consequently turned on. In this ABA signaling pathway, the signal is gathered by 14 ABA receptors and transduced and integrated through nine PP2Cs and three SnRK2s. Presumably, in these steps, the signal information is processed by different interactions between components for correct cellular responses.</div></div>
