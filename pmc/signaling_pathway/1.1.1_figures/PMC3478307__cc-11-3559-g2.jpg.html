TLR ligation initiates a signaling cascade leading to activation of NFκB. Activation of NFκB by TLRs is mediated through recruitment of signaling adaptors, including MyD88. The MyD88-dependent pathway, which is utilized by all TLRs except TLR3, mediates assembly of a ternary complex of IRAK proteins. This complex then engages and activates TRAF6, which ultimately leads to activation of NFκB. In addition to activation of NFκB, MyD88-dependent TLR signaling also leads to activation of PI3K. Activation of PI3K by TLRs critically requires the TIR-domain containing TLR adaptor BCAP. Upon stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylated BCAP recruits the PI3K complex. Activated PI3K then phosphorylates its lipid substrate PtdIns(4,5)P2. Increased concentrations of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 leads to activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt by PDPK1. Activation of the PI3K signaling axis represents a major branch of TLR mediated signaling and contributes to a variety of cellular outcomes, including regulation of the inflammatory response, cell proliferation and cell survival.</div></div>
