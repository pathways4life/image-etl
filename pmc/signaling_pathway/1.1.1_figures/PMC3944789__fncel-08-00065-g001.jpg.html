CXCL12 acts through its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7. CXCR4 stimulation leads to the activation of numerous signaling pathways depending on the cell types while CXCR7 has mainly been shown to be involved in scavenging CXCL12, although it can activate a MAP kinase pathway through Î²-arrestin in several systems.</div></div>
