Resveratrol (RESV) reduces Cdk5 activity through inhibition of p35 expression. The inhibitory effects of resveratrol on p35 expression could be brought about at several levels, inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling pathway could affect Egr-1 expression, or activation of the p38 MAPK, JNK and NF-ÎºB signaling pathways could downregulate p35 promoter activity.</div></div>
