(A) Without Wnt, MACF1 (red) binds to a protein complex containing Axin (purple), APC (yellow), β-catenin (green), and GSK3β (light blue). There is no expression of the TCF (blue) controlled genes due to the degradation of β-catenin after phosphorylation by GSK3β. (B) Wnt activates its receptor frizzled and its coreceptor LRP-5/6. MACF1 is involved in the translocation of the complex containing Axin, β-catenin, and GSK3β but not APC from the cytosol to the cell membrane, where Axin and MACF1 bind to LRP-5/6. Subsequently, GSK3β is inactivated by phosphorylation, Axin is degraded, and β-catenin is released and enters the nucleus, where it can activate the Wnt-responsive genes.</div></div>
