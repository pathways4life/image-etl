After exposure of young animals (3â€“4 weeks of age) to an enriched environment for 2 weeks a new LTP inducing signaling pathway appears that involves NMDA type glutamate receptor activation of p38 MAP kinase potentiated by cAMP. B. In conventionally housed animals this signaling pathway is non-functional.</div></div>
