Signaling in PX-866 sensitive tumors comes from an increased reliance on the PI-3-kinase pathway, arising from aberrant activation through growth factors (GF) or mutated components of the pathway itself (*). Tumors with an activated Ras protein show a minimal response to inhibition of the PI-3-kinase pathway due to a shared reliance on alternate signaling pathways including the Raf and RalGDS pathways.</div></div>
