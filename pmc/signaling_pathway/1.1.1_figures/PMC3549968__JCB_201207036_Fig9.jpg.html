Trol binds and sequesters Wg on the surface of SSR. In trol mutants (right), stability of Wg at the postsynaptic site is decreased, and therefore, Wg might preferably bind its receptor DFz2 on the presynaptic membrane, inducing overproliferation of boutons. Thus, Trol regulates bidirectional activity of Wg signaling at the NMJ.</div></div>
