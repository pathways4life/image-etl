From: Looking in the miR-ror: TGF-?-mediated activation of NF-?B in glioma . </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">TGF-β signaling is dysregulated on several levels in cancers, including glioblastoma, and mediates many systemic (immunosuppressive and angiogenic) and cellular effects. In contrast to other cancers, the canonical TGF-β pathway (ligand receptor/Smad mediators) is not commonly mutated in glioblastomas. However, modifiers of TGF-β signaling (e.g., FOXO, FOXG1, BF1, and USP15) and interaction with other pathways lead to a shift from primarily tumor-suppressive effects (e.g., antiproliferation) to oncogenesis. Targeting the interactions between TGF-β and NF-κB signaling may offer therapeutic options. Amplification of EGFR, an NF-κB activator, and mutation of NFKBIA (a NF-κB inhibitor) are mutually exclusive and may inform the effects of two miRs that regulate NF-κB activity, miR-182 and miR-30e*. The role of TGF-β and its relationship to other signaling pathways in gliomas contradicts the growth-suppressive effects and alternative signaling effects of TGF-β in noncancerous cells, such as astrocytes. </div></div>
