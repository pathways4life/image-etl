(b) When cultured in standard rich medium, CAG/MPS-1 cells (M) had diminished pp44/42, which indicates MAPK/ErK signaling activity, while control cells (C) had activated signaling. (c) Serum-starved cells were treated with exogenous recombinant FGF2 at low concentration (5 ng/ml) and high concentration (100 ng/ml). The MAPK/ErK signaling pathway, indicated by pp44/42 level, was not activated in CAG/MPS-1 cells (M) but was activated in control cells (C). (pp44/42: phosphorylated ErK 44/42 protein; p44/42: total ErK 44/42 protein).</div></div>
