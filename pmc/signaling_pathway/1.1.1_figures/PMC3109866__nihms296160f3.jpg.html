From: Converging Pathways in Lifespan Regulation. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Mitochondria are known to signal to the nucleus by at least two mechanisms: one is the retrograde signaling pathway (RTG) that involves LST8 and possibly TOR; the other uses reactive oxygen species and signals through the JNKâ€“FOXO pathway. AMPK also receives input from mitochondria and is yet another protein involved in the mitochondrial control of lifespan.</div></div>
