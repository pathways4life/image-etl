From: Antibody blockade of the Cripto CFC domain suppresses tumor cell growth in vivo. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Model of Criptoâ€™s inhibition of Act B signaling through the Smad2 pathway. Left: Activin (black) signaling via Alk4 (red), ActRII (blue), and Smad2 leads to regulated cell proliferation in many tissues and organs. Right: Cripto-dependent Nodal (yellow) signaling through Smad2 leads to differentiation and patterning in the early embryo. Cripto is represented in green. Center: Cripto inhibits Act B signaling via binding to Alk4 and Act B, resulting in deregulated growth and hyperproliferation. Three possible inhibitory complexes are proposed: Cripto/Act B, Cripto/Alk4, and Cripto/Act B/Alk4. Smad2-p, phospho-Smad2.</div></div>
