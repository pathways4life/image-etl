Five to six Control versus MUN kidney lysates; each protein probed with a specific primary antibody. β-actin represents a housekeeping protein that is not affected by maternal undernutrition (MUN) and was used for normalization of protein loading. Representative bands for the target protein and b-actin are depicted. *P ≤ .05, ** P ≤ .01.</div></div>
