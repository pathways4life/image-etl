Once in the nucleus, phosphorylated NF-κB dimers bind to the promoters of IL-6, IL-8 and SOCS3 and begin gene transcription. IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA are translated into protein and secreted into the medium. SOCS3 mRNA is also translated into protein and acts as a negative regulator of JAK/STAT3, preventing STAT3 activation.</div></div>
