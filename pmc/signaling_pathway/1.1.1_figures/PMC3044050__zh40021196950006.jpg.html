Upon growth factor (GF) binding to its respective receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and activation of the respective signaling pathway, Spry2 is induced to translocate to the inner plasma membrane where it gets activated (in many cases via phosphorylation on the Y55 by a Src-like kinase) and functions by interacting with various MAPK signaling pathway-associated proteins in a GF-specific manner. When RTK signaling is Ras dependent (left), Spry2 inhibition of this pathway is thought to occur at the level of GF receptor-bound protein-2 (Grb2) or Raf1. When RTK signaling is Ras independent (right), Spry2 inhibition of this pathway is thought to occur at the level of Raf1. In many cases, pY55 is required for Spry2 inhibition of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway. The dominant-negative Y55F mutant of Spry2 inhibits endogenous Spry2 action, thereby promoting the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway. FGF-2, fibroblast GF-2; PDGF, platelet-derived GF; pY, phosphorylated tyrosine; Sos1, son of sevenless-1; PLC-γ, phospholipase C-γ; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; PKC, protein kinase C.
