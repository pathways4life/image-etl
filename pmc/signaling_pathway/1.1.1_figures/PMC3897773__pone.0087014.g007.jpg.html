The dotted lines with the question marks indicate remaining areas of investigation for further elucidation of the molecular mechanism of α-secretase activation. cAMP-dependent pathway of α-secretase induction was previously reported and is depicted as a plausible way for 5-HT4d receptor-mediated sAPPα release [15].</div></div>
