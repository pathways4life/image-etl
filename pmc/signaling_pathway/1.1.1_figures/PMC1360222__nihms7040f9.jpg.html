Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is mediated by p38 MAPK-dependent production of a putative growth factor(s) that functions in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is sufficient to confer a pro-survival/apoptosis-resistant phenotype to human mesenchymal cells/fibroblasts.</div></div>
