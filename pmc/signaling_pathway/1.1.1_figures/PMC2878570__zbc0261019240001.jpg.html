Upon alkaline pH stimulation, the pal pathway (PalH, PalF, PalI, PalC, PalA, and PalB) mediates conversion of PacC72 (i.e. 72 kDa) into the committed 53-kDa intermediate PacC53, which is further processed to 27-kDa PacC27. B, Western analysis of Myc3-PacC processing in wild-type and palH− strains. Cells were cultured at pH 4.2 (H+) and shifted to pH 8.2 (OH−) for the indicated times. Actin levels were used as loading control.</div></div>
