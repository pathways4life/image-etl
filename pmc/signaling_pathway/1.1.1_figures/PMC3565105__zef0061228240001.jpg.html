Extranuclear signaling of E2/ERα: Several signaling proteins like PI3K, Src, HPIP, MTA1s, etc., interact with ERα in the cytoplasm to activate E2 extranuclear signaling. Rapid E2 signaling promotes interaction of ERα with caveolin-1 in the caveoli and activates the PI3K/AKT pathway. Sequestration of ERα by HPIP in the cytoplasm through a microtubule scaffolding mechanism facilitates PI3K/Src recruitment, and activation of AKT/MAPK pathways occurs in response to rapid E2 signaling. MTA1s also activate E2 rapid signaling through cytoplasmic sequestration of the receptor. In response to rapid E2/ERα signaling, PELP1 could activate AKT and MAPK pathways by interaction with PI3K and Src kinase, respectively. Activation of downstream signaling kinases such as AKT, MAPK, PAK1, etc., by growth factor signaling led to phosphorylation of ERα, which could further impact its nuclear activity. Phosphorylation of ERα by GSK3 also enhances ERα transcriptional activity. Methylation of ERα at arginine 260 by PRMT1 involves activation of FAK signaling in response to E2 rapid signaling. Genomic signaling of E2/ERα: Ligand binding to ERα ensures heat shock protein (HSP) dissociation and the receptor's nuclear entry. Upon nuclear translocation, ligand-bound receptor binds to its target genes to activate the transcription. If the HDAC complex is recruited to ERα chromatin, ERα-dependent transcription is repressed, whereas HAT complex recruitment activates ERα-dependent transcription. This model also illustrates that ERα can regulate the gene expression by extensive chromatin looping to bring genes together for coordinated transcriptional regulation.
