The pathway 'ethylene signaling' is viewed using the yFiles Organic layout in Cytoscape (left) and the 3D tiered layout in MetNetGE (right). The 3D tiered layout reveals several interesting features which can not be easily seen from the 'Organic' layout. For example, there are two metabolites (ethylene and ATP) that regulate many proteins, and one protein (erf1) that activates many RNAs.</div></div>
