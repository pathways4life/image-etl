From: Functional interactions between the ciliopathy-associated Meckel syndrome  1 (MKS1) protein and two novel MKS1-related (MKSR) proteins. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">MKS-1, MKSR-1 and MKSR-2 proteins appear to function upstream of DAF-2 and  DAF-16 in the insulin–IGF-I signaling pathway to regulate lifespan. (A)  The lifespan of mksr-1;mksr-2;daf-2 triple mutant animals is the same  as that of the long-lived daf-2 mutants, supporting the notion that  B9-domain-containing proteins function upstream of the DAF-2  insulin–IGF-I signaling pathway. *P&lt;0.0001  compared with daf-2. (B) The lifespan of all mks/mksr double  mutants is shortened when introduced into a daf-16 mutant background,  suggesting that the MKS-1, MKSR-1 and MKSR-2 proteins function upstream of the  DAF-16 FOXO transcription factor in the insulin–IGF-I signaling pathway.  *P&lt;0.0001 compared with daf-16. (C) The  mks/mksr double mutants have increased levels of DAF-16::GFP in the  nucleus, consistent with their increased lifespan compared with wild-type (N2)  animals and their corresponding single mutants (mks-1 and  mksr-1). The osm-5 ciliary mutant positive control is  impaired in DAF-2 signaling and has an increased level of nuclear DAF-16::GFP.  Animals were categorized as having mainly cytoplasmic DAF-16::GFP (white  bars), intermediate localization between the cytoplasm and nucleus (light gray  bars), or mainly nuclear localization (dark gray bars); examples of these  three localization patterns are shown on the right.  *P&lt;0.05 compared with N2.</div></div>
