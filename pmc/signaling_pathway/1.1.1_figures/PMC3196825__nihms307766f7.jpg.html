Schematic overview showing the effects of radiation and BV6 on the apoptotic <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> cascade in HCC193 and H460 cell lines.  From: BV6, an IAP antagonist, activates apoptosis and enhances radiosensitization of non-small cell lung carcinoma in vitro. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">(A) In HCC193 cells, apoptosis is primarily activated through the extrinsic pathway. Cell surface death receptors are activated by ligands such as TNFα and TRAIL, leading to the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic signaling cascade through initiator caspase-8. IAPs exert their anti-apoptotic activity by inhibiting both this cascade as well as TNFα-mediated NF-κB signaling. BV6 blocks these effects by antagonizing IAPs, inducing their degradation, and enhancing TNFα secretion. (B) In H460 cells, apoptosis is primarily mediated through the intrinsic pathway. Here, cell stress triggers mitochondria to release the Apaf-1/cytochrome c complex, leading to the activation of the intrinsic pathway through caspase-9. BV6 prevents IAPs from inhibiting this cascade, and also induces their proteosomal degradation.</div></div>
