(<b>a</b>) Expression of PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling molecules were repressed at protein levels with FUT4, FUT6 or FUT8 shRNA transfection in BEL/FU cells. (<b>b</b>) The increased protein levels of PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling molecules were determined using western blot in BEL7402/FUT4, FUT6 or FUT8 cells. (<b>c</b>) Decreased relative expression of MRP1 to Na+/K+-ATPase was examined using flow cytometry analysis in FUT4-, FUT6- or FUT8-shRNA-treated BEL/FU cells. (<b>d</b>) Flow cytometry analysis revealed a higher relative expression of MRP1 to Na+/K+-ATPase in BEL7402 cells with FUT4, FUT6 or FUT8 transfection. The data are means±S.D. of three independent assays (*P&lt;0.05)</div></div>
