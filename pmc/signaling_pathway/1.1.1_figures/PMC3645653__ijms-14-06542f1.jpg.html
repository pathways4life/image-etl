Phosphorylation of GSK-3α via either PKA or PI3K signaling pathway inhibits the kinase activity of GSK-3α. Inhibition of GSK-3α stabilizes β-catenin that results in a decrease in its degradation and promotes β-catenin nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of Tcf/Lef-regulated genes. Activation of either PKA or PI3K signaling pathway leads to phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB regulating cAMP responsive gene expression. Activation of the PI3K/ERK pathway induces functional expression of EGR-1, known to regulate PGE2 synthase. In addition, PI3K signaling pathway inhibits the activity of PKA.</div></div>
