From: Elevated Hepatic Iron Activates NF-E2-Related Factor 2-Regulated <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Pathway</span> in a Dietary Iron Overload Mouse Model. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Alterations in the NRF2 canonical pathway in livers of mice treated with TMHF. Liver proteins from mice fed a control or TMHF diet mice for 4 weeks (four mice in each group) were labeled and analyzed by iTRAQ. The data from iTRAQ were then analyzed using IPA. A modified schematic of the NRF2 signaling pathway obtained from IPA is shown. The diagram was reduced in magnitude to include only those categories containing proteins that were identified as upregulated (shades of red) or downregulated (green) by TMHF by more than Â± 1.5-fold of the control in this iTRAQ profile. Proteins in white circles were not among the 74 identified proteins.</div></div>
