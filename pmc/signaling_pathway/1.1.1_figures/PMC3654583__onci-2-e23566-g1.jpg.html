Upon fusion with the plasma membrane, the hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-E) introduces fragments of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, which are recognized by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). The RIG-I/RNA complex associates with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, which in turn promotes the activation of several transcription factors. In cells from the immune system, the RIG-I/MAVS pathway stimulate antitumor immunity via the production of some cytokines such as interferon (IFN)α, IFNβ and CXCL10. In cancer cells, this signaling pathway induces apoptosis upon the activation of pro-apoptotic factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and NOXA.</div></div>
