P-Hsp27 was correspondently overexpressed via the activation of upstream p38 MAPK signaling in DRSPs. (B) Knockdown of Hsp27 reversely induced the upregulation of CI-caspase 3 and CI-PARP, resulting in increased apoptosis in DRSPs. However, there was no alteration of upstream p38 MAPK. (C) Knockdown of p38 MAPK directly downregulated p-Hsp27, indicating the presence of the p38 MAPK–Hsp27 antiapoptotic pathway in DRSPs.</div></div>
