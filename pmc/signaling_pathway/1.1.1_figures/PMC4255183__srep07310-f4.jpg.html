High-grade MDS (n = 18) exhibited higher expression levels of Akt1 and Akt phosphorylation; (L) the p38 phosphorylation in the p38 MAPK pathway was higher in MDS patients, especially in low-grade MDS, than in normal controls; (M) and (N) no significant difference in the phosphorylated ERK1/2 (ERK MAPK pathway) and SAPK/JNK (JNK MAPK pathway) levels was observed between the MDS and normal group; (O) no difference in phosphorylated STAT1 was observed in the Jak-STAT pathway between the MDS and normal group; (P) MDS patients showed increased STAT3 phosphorylation in the Jak-STAT pathway in the MDS group, especially high-grade patients. (Q) and (R) the levels of phosphorylated GSK-3α/β (Ser9) and β-catenin (Ser45) were significantly increased in MDS patients compared to the normal controls. In addition, the P53 signaling pathway was also investigated due to its critical role in regulating cell apoptosis in MDS; (S) P53 phosphorylation was significantly increased in low-grade MDS compared to normal controls and high-grade MDS; (T) the level of PLK1 phosphorylation did not differ between MDS and normal controls. Error bars throughout represent the SEM. The comparison analysis among normal controls, low-grade and high-grade MDS groups were performed using ANOVA test.</div></div>
