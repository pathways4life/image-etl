Mechanistic model.  From: AHR-dependent misregulation of Wnt <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">signaling</span> disrupts tissue regeneration. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Activation of the AHR pathway results in the improper expression of R-Spondin1, which acts through LRP6 to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling. <b>A)</b> Over-activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling causes the stabilization of β-catenin, resulting in the misexpression of various Wnt target genes. <b>B)</b> β-catenin could also be regulated at the post-transcriptional level by direct interactions with Sox9 controlling the expression of these proteins. The inhibitory effect on regeneration after AHR activation could be due to an interplay between these events.</div></div>
