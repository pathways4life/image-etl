A and B, The lack of effect of 3 mm Li+, an inhibitor of GSK-3, on bromocriptine (Bromo)-induced inhibition of basal PRL release in cells without (A) and with (B) blocked Gi/o signaling pathway (250 ng/ml PTX, overnight). Traces shown are representative from three similar experiments. C, The lack of effects of 1 μm wortmannin (WT), an inhibitor of PI3-kinase, and 3 mm Li+, on dopamine (DA)-induced inhibition of basal PRL release. Traces shown are pooled data from five independent experiments. D, Effects of acute treatment with 100 nm PMA on 1 μm dopamine (DA)-induced inhibition of PRL release in cells with and without blocked Gi/o signaling pathway. PMA was applied 30 min before and during application of dopamine. Traces shown are representative from three similar experiments.</div></div>
