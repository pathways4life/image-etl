Closure of VFT extracellular domains upon binding of arginine ligand promotes and reinforces receptor dimerization inducing kinase activation and autophosphorylation of VKR. Phosphotyrosines can bind different partners for the transduction of conserved RTK signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway involved in protein synthesis and the Ras/MAPK ERK pathway important for cell growth and proliferation. Moreover, activated VKRs could activate through the specific binding of Shb (SH2-containing protein), the alternative JNK pathway to contribute in concert with Rho1, MEK7, and PP2C to cytoskeleton rearrangement and oocyte maturation. Phosphorylation of AKT, p70S6K, ERK, and JNK (circled in red) was confirmed in VKR-expressing Xenopus oocytes (22).</div></div>
