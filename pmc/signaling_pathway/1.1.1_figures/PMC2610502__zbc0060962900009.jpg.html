From: How Does Arrestin Assemble MAPKs into a <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span>  Complex?. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody"><b>Model of the MAPK signaling module organized by arrestin.</b> Front  (A) and side (B) views of the three-dimensional model of  arrestin complex with the three MAP kinases are shown. Arrestin  (green) is shown as an elongated two-domain molecule. All the kinases  are shown with thick cylinders representing kinase domain, and thin ones  representing N- and C-terminal elements. MAPKKK (pink) is represented  as ASK1 dimer in the JNK3 pathway with its C and kinase domain interacting  with arrestin, and MAPK (purple) with its N terminus interacting with  arrestin. MAPKK (yellow) also interacts with both domains of  arrestin.</div></div>
