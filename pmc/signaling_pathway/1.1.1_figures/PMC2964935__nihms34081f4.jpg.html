From: The PAR Proteins: Fundamental Players in Animal Cell Polarization. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The PAR signaling pathway; phosphorylation and binding of PAR-5 provides a mechanism for mutual exclusion from different PAR domains. On the left, PAR-1 that has diffused onto the apical domain is phosphorylated by aPKC, which inhibits the PAR-1 kinase activity and induces binding of PAR-5, which in turn triggers release into the cytoplasm. A similar mechanism probably controls the cortical attachment of LGL, Numb, and perhaps XGAP. In a reciprocal fashion, PAR-3 that diffuses into the basolateral domain is phosphorylated by PAR-1, which induces binding of PAR-5 and release into the cytoplasm.</div></div>
