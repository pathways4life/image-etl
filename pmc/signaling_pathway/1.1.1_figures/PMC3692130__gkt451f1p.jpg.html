This pathway has a canonical Wnt/β-catenin cascade and two non-canonical pathways, named Wnt/Planar cell polarity (Wnt/PCP) pathway and Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, which conform the complete Wnt signaling pathway (<b>A</b>). Here, we represent the Wnt pathway in a gene expression microarray experiment in which colorectal cancer patients are compared with control subjects (14). In the diagrams, nodes represent proteins and edges represent the type of interactions among them. (A) The results provided by PATHiWAYS in which the stimulus–response circuits with significantly decreased activity in cancer patients with respect to healthy control subjects are highlighted in blue. Solid edges indicate activations and dotted edges indicate inhibitions. (<b>B</b>) Representation, using the cytoscape program, of the individual gene expression activations (in red) or deactivations (in blue) when comparing the cancer samples with respect to the normal control samples. Edges ended in an arrow indicate activations and edges ended in ‘T’ indicate inhibitions. Despite many genes in many circuits increase or decrease their activity (B), only a few circuits are really affected by these changes (A).</div></div>
