Schematic representation of the basic structure of CIP2A (A) and the mode of interaction of CIP2A with c-MYC and PP2A (B).  From: Oncogenic nexus of cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A): An oncoprotein with many hands. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The “oncogenic nexus” of CIP2A is primarily constituted of the interactive functional network between oncogenic transcription factors, tumor suppressors and different signaling components of the PI3K-mTOR pathway, the RAS-MEK-ERK pathway and the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway. Schematic representation of the major interacting partners of “oncogenic nexus” involving CIP2A protein has been compiled from Puustinen, P., 2014; Perrotti, D. and Neviani, P., 2014; Li, Y., 2013; Khanna, A., 2013; Laine, A., 2013; Niemela, M., 2012; Westermarck, J. and Hahn, W. C. 2008; Junttila, M. R. and Westermarck, J. 2008; Junttila, M. R. et al., 2007. Bi-directional blue arrows indicate interactions between two entities; uni-directional black arrows indicate a positive influence of one on the other entity; blocking red lines indicate a negative influence of one on the other entity. Transcription factors are color coded in pink. Signaling molecules of the RAS-MAPK-ERK pathway and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway are coded in two different shades of blue.</div></div>
