Analysis of Molecular <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Events Controlling Muscular Contraction in C. elegans.  From: Chemical Genetics Reveals an RGS/G-Protein Role in the Action of a Compound. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">The diagram shows the molecular components of the signaling pathways downstream of the muscarinic GPCRs in C. elegans. Alleles of genes encoding proteins in the pathway were tested for their effect on the Egl-d phenotype caused by treatment with BMS-192364. For the pathway members indicated by stars, certain alleles altered the response to treatment with BMS-192364. Specifically, resistance to the Egl-d phenotype was conferred by two gain-of-function alleles of egl-19 and one of egl-30, and by two loss-of-function alleles of eat-16 and one of goa-1.</div></div>
