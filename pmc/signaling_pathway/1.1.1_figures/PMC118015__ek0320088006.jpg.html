From: G-Protein <span class="highlight" style="background-color:">Signaling</span> Mediates Asexual Development at 25?C but Has No Effect on Yeast-Like Growth at 37?C in the Dimorphic Fungus Penicillium marneffei. </a></div><br /><div class="p4l_captionBody">Proposed model for signal transduction pathways regulating development and growth in P. marneffei. GasA signaling at 25°C involves a cAMP-PKA pathway in the regulation of asexual development and the expression of the core regulatory factors BrlA and AbaA. GasA has no apparent role during yeast cell morphogenesis at 37°C. Therefore, we hypothesize the presence of a brlA repressor (black box) as well as an abaA activator (white box) which are independent of GasA signaling at this temperature.</div></div>
