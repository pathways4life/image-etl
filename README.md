# Image ETL
This repo contains code, resource files, protocols and results for processing pathway figures to generate sets of images with recognized gene symbols. The extracted information can itself be distributed as a valuable resource of annotated pathway figures. The goal is to also use this information to prompt a facilitated crowdsourcing effort to trace over the images and thereby model the pathways using a fork of the pvjs pathway editor.

**More information can be found in the [main repo](https://github.com/pathways4life/main), which includes proposals and other human readable content.**

### PMC Image ETL - sample run
Please refer to the [code book](codebook.md) for code and protocols to extract PMC figures, perform OCR and count relevant gene sets.
